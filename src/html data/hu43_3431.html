The apricot embers on the tip of his stick lost their intensity as he flicked the cigarette away onto the asphalt below him. There was a van scheduled to be arriving soon, one which held the guns that his supplier down South had smoothly managed to deal him. The 24 year old thug was a part of the Twisted Crown street gang that had dominated this neighborhood and a majority of the surrounding territory. Drug trafficking and arms dealing was disguised by the community programs that the Twisted Crown leadership established in order to garner support from the locals. Everyone from your basic convenience store robber to your suited-up bank burglar dealt with the Twisted Crown when the purchase of fire-arms were involved. It was exactly the latter that were laying low within the parking lot next to a brick and cinder apartment building.<br />\n<br />\nTwo four-wheel-drive, all-terrain vehicles with deceptive interior armor plating were parked unevenly in their splendid, glossy black glory. Standing near the trucks was a group of seven men, all dressed in half-casual clothing. The group was of mixed ethnicity, and wore wide sunglasses despite it being evening time. Mario was near the slide-gate entrance to the lot, dressed in baggy and loose, yet expensive clothing and jewelry akin to that of the well-established street gangster.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Shears. We\'re running on time here, mate.&quot; a middle-aged, masculine voice spoke with a hint of a British accent. The man\'s tone was serious, enough to make Shears actually worry. His clients were no-nonsense thieves who desired hefty firepower and specialized automated power-tool technology. The man running this group of filthy rich burglars was also one Shears did not wish to cross. Although the Twisted Crown had the necessary skill and fire-power to do business with petty criminals or even professionals, the street gang was far from ever reaching the cold level of a super-villain.<br />\n<br />\nThe man running the outfit of professional thieves was seated safely inside of the trucks. His right-hand man, Isaiah, was handling this exchange.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;No problemo, man. The yard tools you need are pulling in now. I\'d like to see the veggies you\'re packing for payment, though, first.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nIsaiah took off his shades and stared at Shears under the moonlight, his one hand going down to his hip which pushed his open blazer up along his elbow. The Caucasian, scraggly-faced man pursed his pink lips and swept his hand across his short, hazel colored hair. A small tractor unit pulled into the parking lot, it\'s white cargo compartment covered over by colorful and explicit Twisted Crown graffiti.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Alright. I see the lorry. Someone feed this fish.&quot; One of Isaiah\'s partners brought forwards a black duffel bag, striped with pumpkin orange lines. The woman, dressed in a business suit and pair of knee-high boots, opened the bag up and showed Mario the opulent stacks of large bills within it.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Damn, I love doing business with you people because the money always looks fresh out of the vault. So clean and minty fresh. I trust that the full amount is here. Just take the truck, it\'s too ugly and reminds me of the old days where a brutha\' got shot over the stupidest of shyeeeet.&quot; Mario remarked, taking the bag and slinging it over his shoulder. He went over to the wall of the apartment building and leaned against it. This was to show to the thieves that if something was sour with the deal, Mario would be committed to seeing it through instead of dipping out. Isaiah went to the back hatch of the cargo compartment and slid it open. Inside were crates and packaging boxes.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Full hardware? Trowels and all?&quot; Isaiah cried out. Mario, standing with a nonchalant demeanor while casually expressing boredom, shouted back to the man with,<br />\n<br />\n&quot;I told one of them to have a box unlocked. Go \'head and check it out. Plenty of seeds too, enough to load up...well, shyeeet now I\'m just saying too much.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nWithin an unsealed crate was an assortment of automatic rifles and sub-machine guns with cases of magazines packaged alongside the fire-arms. Isaiah\'s whiskered face curled into a smirk as he closed the lid to one of the crates and jumped out the back of the truck. The driver exited the tractor unit and shut the door, walking himself up to Mario. The two did a laid-back and ghetto hand-slap greeting.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;We can always trust you, Mario. What is this, the fifth time we needed some shovels? Alright boys and girls, we get rich tomorrow in the morning, so mount up. Thanks for the set of wheels, maybe if the boss says we can fill it with shite and drive it into the lobby.&quot; Isaiah laughed. He headed towards one of the trucks, along with the rest of his group. Mario snickered, feeling a twinge of fear. Was this guy serious?<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Cheeeel, nah brah that\'s mad gassy. No pun intended, EH HYEH EHEHE.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe thieves exited from the parking lot as Mario ended his over-dramatic laughter. Once the group was gone, Mario exhaled and took out his smart-phone. Whatever the thieves had planned for tomorrow morning, it sounded extraordinarily volatile. The driver, a skinny and younger man named Booker approached Mario with low whispers and a jumpy attitude.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Yo Mar, is these nic\'kas for real? There\'s enough guns in that truck for a small army, and all that exotic as hell power-tool crap? Whut duh hell?&quot;<br />\n<br />\nMario waved him off and headed towards his own vehicle. Booker followed in his foot-steps, silent and curious.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Dey\'s like knights. Whole tower going to be held under siege. I just hope it doesn\'t become another 9-11.&quot; Mario coldly replied. Booker swore under his breath and appeared baffled. The two of them got into Mario\'s souped up drag racer and pulled noisily out of the parking lot.<br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile, Isaiah sat in the passenger side seat of one of the large all-terrain vehicles. It was like a pearly black behemoth in the streets, and adding another plus the truck created a convoy of heavy, broad metal. The man scratched his bearded chin and glanced back to his boss.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Everyone\'s prepared, sir. We\'re ready to get rich or die trying, and we\'ve got the fire-power to give us the edge. The plan is clear, we\'ve got the equipment ready for the insertion and have our exfil informed and ready. We won\'t leave until you\'e there with us.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nIsaiah cleared his throat and continued to stare at his close friend, who grunted in acknowledgement.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;I\'m also ready for our big performance. Remember, the attention is going to be on me. You do what you need to do, I can handle myself. If you have the chance to go, take it.&quot; the boss replied, his gruff voice was rough and mature.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Ugh, Ash! C\'mon mate, quit the \'die by the sword\' nonsense. Don\'t be reckless, bruv.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Relax, my friend. I don\'t intend on dying tomorrow. We\'re going to cripple Varrion Industries if it\'s the last thing I do.&quot;</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font color="#333333">Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of <b>Alpha City</b>, the </font><font color="#0000ff">Tech District</font><font color="#333333">.

The two celebrities were stunning married couple of actor and actress, who were in their prime. <br />\n<br />\nThe valet smiled and held out the keys to Rodney\'s sports car, which the older man snatched away with a swift swipe. He was dressed in dinner party apparel, and had alcohol on his breath. The valet noticed, but simply smiled at the man and shuffled himself away. Before the young man left, he stole a peak at the back of Farah\'s figure. She was currently wearing a strap-less, daring blue dress which complimented the bronze tint to her fair skin well. Her athletic figure was trim and perfect, just like her husband\'s sculpted body. Both blonde-headed partners were soon on their way through the Hills, marveling at the beautiful illumination which made the city glow as its night-life raged on.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Well, that was an utter waste of time.&quot; Rodney lamented, his pained eyes concentrating on the traffic before him. His wife gasped and lightly punched his shoulder.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;It was a charity dinner! I thought it was fun.&quot; she quipped. Her husband shot her a sideways look and rolled his eyes.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;I know, I know. Still it wouldn\'t kill ya\' to dress with some modesty. You\'re not a pop singer, y\'know.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nFarah glared at her husband for a moment. The man had always been one to complain about how she wore excessively revealing clothing which the media just ate up. He had even mentioned something about her having an exhibitionist fetish some time before.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;What can I say, other men can appreciate a woman\'s body more than her husband can.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nRodney huffed out a deep sigh and shook his head in annoyance.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Relax, baby, I\'m just say-&quot;<br />\n<br />\nIt was in that moment that a swarm of teenagers flocked into the center of the road. Rodney was currently on a one-way that had a rather high speed limit, and he was roaring down the street like the rest of the traffic. Human bodies began to fly in the air and the cars started to swerve or cut dangerously to either side of the road. Rodney and Farah shouted in utter terror as their car tried to slow down and retain control in their lane while all around them enormous splatters of blood and devastating vehicle wrecks created a scrap-yard in the street. <br />\n<br />\nRodney\'s sports car jolted to a halt and pulled far onto the side-walk, where people quickly scurried out of the way. Behind the celebrity couple were over-turned cars, totaled vehicles, destroyed lights and fallen trees, as well as corpses everywhere. Multiple alarms and airbags had gone off, and the survivors of this bloody mess were struggling to find sense in the mangled remains of this horrible event.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Oh my goodness oh my DAMN-' + '-&quot; Farah wept, falling into a terrific state of panic. Rodney stared at his steering wheel and panted, his eyes were wide and he repeatedly cursed as he tried to calm himself down and make sense of the situation. Everything had been a recipe for disaster. There was virtually no way anyone could have escaped this mess unharmed. The innocent people were had just been on the sidewalks or in the buildings on either side of the street had witnessed this tragic horror, some had even received injuries from the shrapnel and debris Dozens of people were calling the police at the same time, and all tried not to stare too hard at the corpses.<br />\n<br />\nRodney exited his car, to the dismay of his wife, and put a hand to his sweaty fore-head. He leaned onto his car-door and felt like vomiting as he observed all the trails of blood and the twisted bodies of the corpses. Suddenly he saw movement out of the corner of his eyes. Ignoring the chill of the night and the pandemonium around him, Rodney sprinted towards a flipped over sedan. There was a teenage girl who was currently twitching in a puddle of her own scarlet blood.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;I\'m here, please don\'t move too much. I\'m here now, don\'t die on me!&quot; Rodney demanded. The girl turned blood speckled face towards the actor. He recoiled in terror when he saw how her eye-sockets were completely empty. Trickles of blood fell down from her eyes, and she smiled with blackened teeth at the actor. Her neck jerked to one side as her head began to turn in unnatural ways. In a dissonant and demonic, chilling type of broken speech the girl whispered,<br />\n<br />\n&quot;A\'ma...K\'ilk...Na\'tos.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nShe then relaxed her body and went still. Rodney seated himself onto the street, crawling backwards with teary eyes as he tried not to panic. He bit his knuckle and swept his palms onto the street below, feeling the rough texture of the glass particles from the wrecks on his skin and bottom. He looked around at the survivors and realized that the teenagers who had run into the road were also repeating the same words the girl had just said before perishing.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Oh God. Oh Jesus.&quot; Rodney whimpered. He stood up and ran back to his car, where he managed to see through the driver-side window that Farah was still seated inside. Rodney slammed the door shut and tensely seated himself. He exhaled and glanced over to his wife to ask her how she was feeling.<br />\n<br />\nThe woman just stared at the ground, her wavy hair blocking her face from view. Rodney slowly moved his hand to her bare shoulder.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Farah-baby? You okay?&quot; he questioned, he sounded concerned and was scared to touch her. His finger-tips neared the blemishes on her shoulder more and more, until finally he connected his skin with hers. Farah jerked herself upwards and gasped in surprise. She blinked a few times and looked over to her husband. The water-proof eye-liner she had been wearing still managed to leave small trails down her face.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Oh my, oh Christ I\'m okay. I\'m okay. Are you okay?! What the hell were you doing going out there it\'s terrible!&quot; she cried, her high voice appeared to breaking as overwhelming grief and fear crept into her mind.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;C\'mere, stay calm. Shhh, shhhh I\'m right here. Outside is, nothing. Alright?&quot; Rodney spoke, consoling his wife as he held her close to his body. His phone began ringing, and he cursed under his breath. He looked to his wife, who gave him a sympathetic nod, and he answered the call. The Caller ID had read &quot;Santa&quot; which was never pleasant.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Hey, Mr. C how\'re you doing? Uh, listen, some crazy shi-&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Gilly-boy, shut up. It\'s been three days now, and I want my compensation already. When am I going to get my payment?&quot; the voice interjected. The caller was a man who possessed a light Italian accent, which rang out clearly and confidently.<br />\n<br />\nRodney tried not to sound out his irritation at the caller. He scratched his hair and looked outside. The faint sound of sirens could be heard, which was good. The image of the teenage girl and her face was burned into Rodney\'s mind, and he tried to ignore it so he could focus on the call.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;You wanted some support, and I gave you my support. Now I expected compensation to be transferred into my bank account three freakin\' nights ago. Am I going to have to come down there is Jaggoffville and pay the wife a visit? That is, if she\'s free for the day knowing her copious scheduling.&quot; the voice joked.<br />\n<br />\nRodney looked to his wife, who once again was staring down at the floor. He wanted to try and shake her back into attention.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Farah!&quot; he harshly whispered, desperate to know if her mental health was still fine.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Exactly, Mrs. Gilligan. The \'Shining Star\' as they call her. Hell of a wife you got there, Gilly-boy. You wouldn\'t want to see her, I dunno, shipped off to another country in a dark container would you now? It\'d be a great story for the media, and I\'d make a ton of money from overseas clients. Nabbing an actress, and an academy award winner at that. Heh. I want my money, Rodney. I want it by tomorrow night, and I want all of it.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Y-yeah no problem. I\'ve already got it, I just needed to talk to someone. Here I am talking to you now, we\'ll organize something tomorrow night, no problem.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nFarah groaned in a raspy voice, and moved her manicured finger-nails to her face. Rodney, alarmed at his wife\'s actions, clutched one of her wrists and violently shook the woman. The locks of sandy blonde hair covering her face were shaken away to reveal Farah\'s glossy eyes. Rodney dropped his phone, ignoring Santa\'s speech. He grabbed his wife\'s other wrist as well, and stared directly into her face.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Farah! Farah!&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe sirens were getting so much louder now. Rodney\'s smart-phone displayed a CALL ENDED message. Farah groaned once more in a raspy voice.

Not many had the might, or resources to compete against him allowing him to dominate most of the technological industry. In the fields he did not control, he had established a foothold. It was well known within the company that even since Edmond became the CEO, competition faltered and Heidis grew to be very successful. It was these thoughts that occupied Edmonds time as he gazed out the window. <br />\n&quot;What must I do to insure...&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;S sir, I have the...&quot; Edmond was interrupted. He turned his large lavish chair around to see a timid woman in a business dress holding a clipboard. Normally she would be out the door, taking his calls, and sending memos. Her name tag read &quot;Charlotte, Secretary&quot;. Before she finished speaking Edmond spoke, &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />\n<br />\nWalking closer to his desk, Charlotte removed a folder from behind her clipboard and held it out in front of her. &quot;The city-wide consumer report you wanted sir.&quot; Edmond reach out and took it, turning his chair around without saying a thing. The folder with filled with papers of graphs, charts, and percentages. As he expected, a large portion of the charts involved Heidis and seemed to show it in favorable numbers. Edmond smirked as it showed just how much the company was on it\'s way.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Also. It has been discovered the Varrion has managed to increase their profit by...&quot; Charlotte continued to speak, knowing that Edmond was able to hear her just well from behind the chair. In a matter of speaking, Varrion seemed to be the one corporation that Heidis could not overcome. All attempt to buy them out, or even cut them down failed. Their business just continued to grow. And no matter any business tactic Edmond had implored to discover their secrets, he was unable to get in. Their ability to do so infuriated Edmond, but he laid off, content in only making sure that their business did not impede his own. Even Edmond had to admit that they were a respectable company regardless of the bad press it has received. <br />\n<br />\nTurning his chair around once more, he stood up, dusted himself off and looked at Charlotte. She stopped talking. Edmond walked around his desk and stood in front of charlotte. She was not sure what to do, but then Edmond moved to the side and walked out of his office stopping only to tell Charlotte to go home for the night.\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i1089.photobucket.com/albums/i343/masterlife1/Signatures%20and%20Banners/SignitureFountain_zpsb90efc71.png" border="0" alt="" /><br />\n<div>\r\n    <div class="pre-spoiler">\r\n     <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:80px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display != \'\') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display = \'\';this.innerText = \'\'; this.value = \'Hide\'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display = \'none\'; this.value = \'Show\';}">&nbsp;<span style="padding-top: 2px;">Spoiler</span>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class="spoiler" style="display: none;"><a href="http://www.anime-planet.com/users/Randomnes/forumsig" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.anime-planet.com/images/users/signatures/Randomnes.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div><br />\n</div></div></blockquote>\r\n				\r\n				\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="cleardiv"></div>\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n		<div class="postfoot">\r\n			<!-' + '- <div class="postfoot_container"> -' + '->\r\n			<div class="textcontrols floatcontainer">\r\n				<span class="postcontrols">\r\n					<img style="display:none" id="progress_3635843" src="images/misc/progress.gif" alt="" />\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n						<a id="qrwq_3635843" class="newreply" href="newreply.php?do=newreply&amp;p=3635843" rel="nofollow" title="Reply With Quote"><img id="quoteimg_3635843" src="clear.gif" alt="Reply With Quote" />  Reply With Quote</a> \r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n				</span>\r\n				<span class="postlinking">\r\n					\r\n						\r\n					\r\n\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n\r\n					\r\n					\r\n\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n				</span>\r\n			<!-' + '- </div> -' + '->\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div>\r\n	<hr />\r\n</li>\r\n';

Fixing his tie, grabbing his wallet, smartphone, sunglasses, keys, jacket and hat. He made his way out the door saying &quot;<i>Today is gonna be a hectic day. Last thing I need is for there to be more traffic.</i>&quot;<br />\n<br />\nJumping into his supped up sports car, he sped off heading towards mid town in the Glam district. That day one of the executives of one of the few Varrion HQ buildings in the Glam district was making a press conference to announce some &quot;big thing&quot;. Just another one of their PR stunts trying to make up for all the rumors and claims of criminal activity. But to Charles, that meant that all eyes were going to be on the executive and not their valuables. Varrion was well known for it\'s rumors of criminal activities, and Charles had no qualms about stealing from a corrupt corporate powerhouse. And if he\'s lucky, he could get some information that would be valuable enough for leverage. He makes his way to a hotel not too far from the Varrion building, where he could get a clear shot of the press conference. Dropping off his car to the valet and checking into his penthouse room. Three hours later, the conference is about the begin.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;<i>It\'s almost time for my performance..</i>&quot; Charles whispered. He had the television playing, tuned in on the press conference. His queue was when the executive started to speak. and in that instant he heard &quot;Thank you for coming..&quot;. Charles opened a wormhole that led to an underground parking lot right under the Varrion building, hidden where nobody could see him. He made his way to the elevator, and pulling out of his pocket, he used an administrative ID card to head straight to the security floor.<br />\n<br />\n</span></span><br />\n<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: impact"><span style="font-family: arial">-<i>8 minutes earlier</i>-<br />\n<br />\n</span></span></div><span style="font-family: impact"><span style="font-family: arial">Charles, while watching the executive before the conference, waited for his chance to steal his ID card.

At the same time, the elevator reached the security floor and a few guards went to check it out. Charles opened another </span></span><font color="#B22222"><span style="font-family: impact">SM </span></font><span style="font-family: arial">portal, this time directly in front of him, covering his entire body. The other side of the portal opened on his backside, so the guards who soon arrived to the elevator only saw an empty elevator. They radioed in to the other guard saying it was empty. The two guards made their way into the elevator for closer examination. One turned their back to check out the control panel, while the other continued looking around the elevator. Right before that guard ran into Charles\' portal, the guard still in the control room radioed the two in the elevator, asking &quot;<i>Where are you guys right now?</i>&quot;. The guard stopped, grabbed his radio and said &quot;<i>What\'re you talking about? We\'re in the Ferkin\' elevator..</i>&quot; <br />\n<br />\n&quot;<i>Uhhh, no you\'re not.. There\'s nothing in the elevator on my screen.</i>&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe guard working the panel states &quot;<i>It\'s probably something wrong with the settings. You\'re probably seeing a different elevator.</i>&quot;<br />\n<br />\n&quot;<i>Stop dicking around and fix it.</i>&quot; The second guard said in an agitated tone.<br />\n<br />\nThe guard in the room ducked under the desk to check the wires and make sure nothing was crossed. During that time, Charles seized his chance. He grabbed one of the Guard\'s tasers, dropping the portal hiding him. Tasering the second guard in the neck, he dropped to the floor unconscious. Without noticing Charles behind him, the first guard working the panel turns to the second and tries to wake him up. Soon after, both were asleep. Charles opened up a new portal, leading to the dumpster outside, dropping both guards inside. Charles walked out of the elevator and went straight down the hall to the security office. The door was locked, but Charles opened a portal on one side, opening up a portal on the other side. <span style="font-family: impact"><font color="#b22222">Skeleton Key</font></span>. <br />\n<br />\nThe last guard, murmuring under the desk. &quot;<i>That damn f**king Gary. He thinks since he got promoted he\'s so special. Well guess what, you\'re not special Gary. Nobody cares that you got promoted..</i>&quot;, while the guard was too busy complaining, it gave Charles the opportunity to sneak up behind him and smack him one good time with a baton. Then all three guards were out. To clean up his tracks, he dropped the third guard in the dumpster with the last two. Getting the administrative password from the security office, he now had the last tool he needed. Next stop, the executive\'s office.</span></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<span style="font-family: arial">Joseph<br />\n<div>\r\n    <div class="pre-spoiler">\r\n     <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:80px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display != \'\') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display = \'\';this.innerText = \'\'; this.value = \'Hide\'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display = \'none\'; this.value = \'Show\';}">&nbsp;<span style="padding-top: 2px;">Spoiler</span>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class="spoiler" style="display: none;">Swords clashing. Sparks flying. Blood splattering. A fight to the death that ends in a gruesome manner. Then Jo wakes up. Starting where he left off, asleep next to a dumpster in a back ally in the tecfas district. A small black cat with blue eyes comes out from inside Jo\'s backpack and onto his shoulder. They stare at each other for a few seconds, then Jo grins. He gets up, dusts himself off. It\'s time to get up and keep moving. <br />\n<br />\nJo, walking down the sidewalk makes a stop at a small corner mart. He buys a gallon of water and some beef jerky. Placing crumbled up dollars from his pocket on the counter. Behind him, he saw a couple black all terrain vehicles on the road behind him. They stuck out like a sore thumb. But with all that goes on in this city, it\'s best not to ask too many questions. Jo thanks the cashier and leaves the store after putting the goods in his backpack, and continued to walk like he had somewhere to go.

Every Thursday evening, there will be an update by the GM on the story. Officially morning time now, the two posts above are taking place during day-time<br />\n<br />\n</b>So far, a heavily armed group of professional thieves are planning on infiltrating an enormous, multi-story Varrion corporation tower with malicious intent. Of the motives, stealing the exorbitant amount of money stored within the tower\'s bank vaults is one of them. The group is lead by a shadowy super-villain named Ash, who\'s right-hand man is named Isaiah. The group armed themselves with equipment and fire-arms purchased from Mario shears, a well known ringleader of the Twisted Crown gang that dominates the TecFas District\'s residential areas. Since it is now morning time, the time of the heist will be arriving soon. <br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile, in the morning after the horrendous mass suicide of last night that resulted in numerous young deaths and casualties as well as copious amounts of property damage, the Glam District appears tense. The Varrion Corporation is currently hosting a small, invite-only meeting of which they announce future business plans and discuss ideas with government agents monitoring the proceedings. The building is taking place in a grand rental hall located between the waterfront wards and the Midtown area. There is seriously illegal mafia crime networks operating secretly within the waterfront wards. These groups have managed to blackmail even the wealthiest of celebrities, such as Rodney Gilligan, into their abusive control. The specific dealings of this criminal empire is not clear, but will be revealed soon. The looming threat of whatever sick phenomena had occurred last night is also an unidentified threat.<br />\n<br />\nRumors and notable events of both districts include:<br />\n<br />\nVarrion corporation officials contacting shady individuals in the waterfront wards with covert meetings<br />\nExcessive religious revival activities and assemblies that involve the Church of God<br />\nMonster sightings and increased Missing Persons reports in the Midtown area<br />\nSecretive hacker groups organizing an unknown, yet dangerous plan of unclear specifications in the TecFas District<br />\nIncreased drug raids and illegal dealings between the citizens regarding the unapproved and illegal narcotic known as &quot;Clue&quot;<br />\nProfessional group of thieves preparing to assault Varrion corporation headquarters building\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				<!-' + '- edit note -' + '->\r\n				<blockquote class="postcontent lastedited">\r\n					\r\n						Last edited by Shmuser Name; 01-23-2015 at <span class="time">05:53 PM</span>.\r\n					\r\n					\r\n				</blockquote>\r\n				<!-' + '- / edit note -' + '->\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font color="#333333">Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of <b>Alpha City</b>, the </font><font color="#0000ff">Tech District</font><font color="#333333">.

She had recently been out of an official job, yet still made plenty of money by doing contract work from Deep Net users. Her flawless computer skills came in handy, and she had acquired enough dirty money to purchase a comfortable and spacious studio apartment for herself in the TecFas District. The morning was slightly chilly, yet the sun was cresting superbly high into the clear sky in all of its golden radiance.<br />\n<br />\nShe had woken up and immediately updated herself with the local news of the city using a website that behaved like the front page of the state. Alpha City was a hotspot of activity, and Riya was diligent in acquiring her information and communicating with contacts to assess valuable personal data and broker it later. She was a shark on the web, constantly checking her tablet and laptop when she was on the go. At home, she was glued to her multi-monitor personal computer which was souped up and secured to be a beast of a machine. It was like an electronic fortress, and had been expensive to craft. This was her workplace for most of the day. The woman still took care to stay in shape and enjoy the outside world, but it paled in comparison to the time that she spent reviewing juicy information that she could sell.<br />\n<br />\nRiya possessed technology capable of accessing camera feeds of mostly all buildings in the city, as well as the smart-phone camera feeds of people actively recording something. This was combined with her anonymous contacts that she paid well and used to gather secrets, as well as the vast network of news that she could access with the click of a button. Riya was also unafraid to personally find her own story, as if she were a journalist for a news agency or radical under-cover agent. In conclusion, Riya played in the city\'s shadows with both ears open and a mouth that could only be opened with money.<br />\n<br />\nThere had been rumors of an arms deal that had occurred in the street-gang ridden neighborhoods bordering the corporate business wards and downtown area. Serious equipment had been trafficked, all for an upcoming event that Riya was absolutely clueless on. She was hungry for information, and decided that after a shower and breakfast, she\'d get right back to work on cracking down the identities of who were involved in this deal. The woman\'s hair had been tied back into a messy pony-tail, with two long and pointed bangs coming down her face. With a quick motion, her long hair fell down to her shoulders and she headed into her luxurious bathroom.</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div><br />\n<br />\nNimbus<br />\n<div>\r\n    <div class="pre-spoiler">\r\n     <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:80px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display != \'\') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display = \'\';this.innerText = \'\'; this.value = \'Hide\'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display = \'none\'; this.value = \'Show\';}">&nbsp;<span style="padding-top: 2px;">Spoiler</span>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class="spoiler" style="display: none;">Evander Harrington was a at a charity event at the bottom few floors of the Yvory Tower, located in the TecFas District. The building was low in the ground, accessible by multi-story car parks that connected to the rear of the building, or the grand stairs and ramps that lead down to the building\'s wide-scooped entrance. The same charity organization that had held a fancy dinner and awards show in the Glam District the night before had also booked a musical event at the Yvory Tower. Hundreds of people had gone, and Evander was just one of the volunteer staff who helped organize and manage the event.<br />\n<br />\nDressed in an employee t-shirt and a pair of khakis, the young man welcomed guests as they gladly shuffled into the main lobby and headed for the handful of ground-level floors where the event was being held. The Yvory Tower\'s main lobby was a spectacle of architectural, spacious beauty that was frequently used as a rental hall for conventions or concerts. It was as if three entire foot-ball fields, decorated with balconies and support pillars as well as excellent and eye-catching lighting, was at the base of this tower. The Yvory Tower was positioned near Varrion Corporation HQ, a skyscraper that dwarfed the Yvory Tower in scopes of height.<br />\n<br />\nEven more tunnels and parking garages connected the region together, as the streets and parking lots of the area were also cluttered with lush green campuses of grass and trees. Along with these patches of bushes and grass were fountains and public statues or other artistic works accessible through pedestrian paths made of stone slabs that encircled the perimeter and the insides of the Yvory Tower and Varrion Corporation HQ.<br />\n<br />\nEvander, by peering through the immense ceiling glass of the front entrance, could make out the first segment of the Varrion corporation\'s mega-skyscraper. The corporate building was fantastic, a great sight to behold by those who enjoyed the more open environment of the Yvory Tower. If anyone wanted easy access to the skyscraper\'s interior parking, they would have to make use of the heavily guarded security tunnels of the underground. Trenches and ramps on the surface allowed vehicular access to the cargo and work parking regions of the interior garage to both buildings. The entire hollow region was like a closed race-way due to its size, and could hold hundreds of vehicles easily.<br />\n<br />\nSomething about the morning event rubbed Evander the wrong way, even though the entire charity concert was going swimmingly well. He wondered if anyone would try and ruin the peace of this place. The Yvory Tower was quite the marvel to many super-villains, as massive crowds were gathered there day after day and it was simple to infiltrate. However the security of the region had been bolstered, and Evander felt that if anything were to happen, it would be resolved quickly by the armed guards. Varrion corporation was also near-by, and they were known for distributing private platoons of para-military to settle extremely violent situations in the city that the police were unable to respond to fast enough, even though they had super-heroes at their call.</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div><br />\n<br />\nLuminary<br />\n<div>\r\n    <div class="pre-spoiler">\r\n     <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:80px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display != \'\') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display = \'\';this.innerText = \'\'; this.value = \'Hide\'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display = \'none\'; this.value = \'Show\';}">&nbsp;<span style="padding-top: 2px;">Spoiler</span>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class="spoiler" style="display: none;"><br />\nHoward Strey, armored in his vigilante outfit and equipped to the teeth with gear, steadily planted his finger-tips onto the ledge of a building\'s roof-top. He gripped the ledge and vaulted himself up, on his side, onto the top of the roof. Large blue sheets, columns of metal turbines and chimneys, as well as a field of solar-panels stretched out along the top of this gray roof-top. Behind Howard was the section of the building that the roof could be accesses through, there were massive metal drums and piping running over the very tops of these small buildings.<br />\n<br />\nWith a huff, Howard jogged over to the edge of the roof-top\'s farthest side. He placed his hands onto the small wall coming up to his waist, and peeked over the edge to the streets below. The entire scene of the mass suicide was locked down, and there were still crews cleaning up the scrap and smears of blood or other fluids and objects that had stained the asphalt and sidewalks. The buildings to the sides of the wide road were all closed down, some were even being checked out by damage-report officials that were followed by news teams. Police tape cordoned the region off, and traffic was non-existent as the majority of the stretch of the road had been closed off.<br />\n<br />\nLuminary stared down at the scene and concentrated. He closed his eyes and sucked in a crisp breath of air. His thoughts became clear, and he felt himself be thrown back in time to the events of the past evening. He was at the edge of the roof-top, looking down to a congregation of teenagers that lined up along the sides of the road on either side. Traffic was brutally quick, there wasn\'t a cross-walk for miles and the wide girth of the road allowed for the activity of four entire lanes as well as parking spaces. Howard focused in with his foggy, imagined reenactment of last night. The teenagers stepped forwards, and then sprung themselves with silence onto the streets. Cars slammed into their bodies and sent them flying up. Windows were smashed and shattered, and vehicles began to swerve or crash as all organized traffic became terrible chaos.<br />\n<br />\nHoward imagined the event once more, refreshing it until he had every detail down. This had all been the power of his imagination, but it was damned good and specific, eerily correct and true to the real events as well. Luminary sighed and shook his head. This was the sixteenth group suicide of teenagers from all around the district, who had no prior contact with each other. He too was irritated that he could not find the missing link which connected them all together. There was only one man who had actually been pro-active and conversed with one of the teenagers before death eventually overcame her, as well as the rest of them. His name was Rodney Gilligan, and he had gone missing from his home last night.<br />\n<br />\nLuminary suspected mafia involvement, as the usual forced entry and flashy escape had been hinted at based off of the evidence and testimonies he accessed. Why did the mafia want Gilligan? Why did these teens, like dozens of others, decide to just end it all together? Who was responsible for this madness? He pledged to avenge the ruined lives of every victim of this chaos, and would bring peace to the families who were heart-broken over these events.<br />\n<br />\nFor now, his first choice of action was to find Rodney Gilligan, and get some answers.</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div><br />\n<br />\nSin-Shaman<br />\n<div>\r\n    <div class="pre-spoiler">\r\n     <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:80px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display != \'\') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display = \'\';this.innerText = \'\'; this.value = \'Hide\'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display = \'none\'; this.value = \'Show\';}">&nbsp;<span style="padding-top: 2px;">Spoiler</span>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class="spoiler" style="display: none;">Somewhere in the darkness of a dark atrium, Sin-Shaman rested her chin onto her gloved hand and crossed one slender leg over the other as she leaned back into her throne, flatting more of her curvy and plump bottom onto the plush seat below her. Mystical torches made of emerald flames illuminated the room, which was decorated with fancy paintings and occult trophies or other oddities that were hung or shelved on the walls for display. A red carpet with golden trimmings, went down the center of the room and up the steps to the woman\'s throne.<br />\n<br />\nSin-Shaman, completely costumed in her super-villain attire, sighed and closed her hands together. She then slowly parted them, producing her magical staff from between her palms. The woman placed one elbow onto her armrest and aimed at the space before her with the tip of her staff. A fiery ring formed in front of her, and was then quickly filled in with glossy green mist. All soon turned completely clear, minus the effect of the fiery outline to this mystical window.<br />\n<br />\nFrom behind her grand throne came two ghostly hands, followed by the face of a young and spectral girl. Her pale and long hair flowed freely atop her scalp, as if she were moving underwater. The apparition then floated away from the back of the throne towards the magical portal in front of her master, revealing her loosely and sparingly clothed body. The floating ghost darted down to the floor and placed her bare feet onto the ground, where she leaned against the side of the throne to speak to her master.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Hello Wisp. I see the the magic at work stimulated your interest? I was just having a little seat, checking out the current events. After last night\'s exhausting ritual practice, I could use a quiet day of relaxation.&quot; Sin Shaman remarked. The woman exhaled heavily and flicked her finger-tips across the space in front of her, where she magically began to stir the messy images of the portal ahead. The portal soon displayed flashing blue and red lights, and began to emit the sounds of sirens. Sin Shaman sat up straighter in her throne, and tilted her head in curiosity.<br />\n<br />\nThe portal then showed the events of last night in the Glam District, expressed through birds-eye viewpoints that accurately displayed the horrific mass suicide in precise detail.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Another one?! The spirits of the dead have become so restless in this city. Wisp, we shall go at once to this scene and investigate whoever is unsettling the region\'s stability. The cursed bastards have over-stayed their welcome, whoever they are. Spirits who cannot pass on may become fueled with emotional desires that can ruin society, they may even become violent. I don\'t want stray wraiths running around the city as I try to master my arcane craft and perfect my collection.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nRising from her throne, Sin Shaman swirled her hand in the air before her and closed the portal. Wisp nodded to the woman and dissipated into the air, bonding her essence to that of Sin Shaman\'s body. Wherever her master went, she would dutifully follow.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;This\'ll give me a chance to stretch out a bit. We move out in the evening, when all is most active. For now, follow me to the waterfront hideout. I need to visit the library and acquire a few interesting tomes that may help us.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nSin Shaman traced her fingers between her ample bosom and down her naval, where she rested her index finger-tip onto her belly. It was as if her scar was a button, and with every push she could uncomfortably experience the tragic events of that day where her curiosity had gotten the better of her. Ultimately the woman had come to master the art of physical soul manipulation...but at a great cost.<br />\n<br />\nNowadays Sin Shaman would not dare of moving onto a new experiment or quest without consulting the books first and studying up. Perhaps some financing would be necessary, as black market artifacts or ingredients did not come cheap for a sorceress like herself, who purchased things lavishly. If that was so, then she was excited to use her destruction spells, and it was about time the imps had a walk as well.</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				<!-' + '- edit note -' + '->\r\n				<blockquote class="postcontent lastedited">\r\n					\r\n						Last edited by Shmuser Name; 01-23-2015 at <span class="time">09:10 PM</span>.\r\n					\r\n					\r\n				</blockquote>\r\n				<!-' + '- / edit note -' + '->\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font color="#333333">Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of <b>Alpha City</b>, the </font><font color="#0000ff">Tech District</font><font color="#333333">.

Her face had no emotions, red lights began to flash, a loud piercing noise rose in the halls of this underground facility. A name was marked on top of the room, Maddy, the name of the subject who just murdered 3 security officers. It was her time to leave. She gave one last look at the warm dead bodies, one had his throat ripped appart, it wasn\'t bleeding like in the movies. The other one had his eyes tore out, last one was beaten to death. Something had the evacuation alarm off, she thought they were sent to extract her. But she didn\'t care, she was leaving, with our without blood on her hands.<br />\n<br />\nMaddy, began to move, her freedom was a few doors away. She could hear footsteps echo in the hallway, they kept going further and further. She did not have any weapons, in fact, her gear was in the armory, if she was lucky enough, she would find them in there. She made her way down the hallways, she came across a few scientifics, nothing to worry about. Did they know her? She didn\'t know nor cared, she hated this place. Her wrath wouldn\'t spare anyone who tried to stop her.<br />\n<br />\nShe finally arrived at her first objective, the armory. The door was opened, not a lot of weapons remained, but her gear remained there. Suit, katana, scout knife and her customined sniper rifle. Of course, there weren\'t any ammo, but she could deal with it, she had her katana. Gearing up, she was ready to leave, she didn\'t know how much time there was left before lockdown, but she had to leave. Leaving the armory, she began to run towards the exit, obviously, emergency exit was written all over the damned place. She didn\'t know where the exit was, how long it would take, she began to worry. After a few minutes of running, she had finally reached the exit, but it was guarded and they did see her. Armed and dangerous, she was a threat for them, even without weapons. They took their battons out, ready to put her under control. There was 3 of them, three option layed out. First, she takes her weapon out and possibly kill them. Two, she vanishes and leaves while they are confused and three, run back in the lab to try and lose them.<br />\n<br />\nShe wasn\'t in any mood to run, she wanted a bit of revenge, bloodshed. Taking her katana out, she took her usual stance, holding it on her left side with both hands and pointing it at them. They slowly walked to her, but she did not wait for them. She launched herself at them, cutting one of them open, spilling their guts on the ground, unaware of what happened. His two comrades jumped back, affraid of her next move. But she was exhausted, not from today, but overall, her next move needed to be the last. This was an opening for her, to go back to the real world once again. She vanished from their eyes, finally able to run away, she ran like scared fox. She could finally feel the light from the sun, but she wasn\'t out yet. Everyone was gathered around, she had to infiltrate the crowd and leaved. Swinging her katana towards the ground, spilling the blood off, she sheated her blade and walked towards the crowd, becoming visible again.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;HEY, YOU, STOP.&quot; A voice screamed.<br />\n<br />\nThe two other security officers noticed her, pushing a red button on the wall. An automatic voice started on a microphone.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;This is not a drill, I repeat, this is not a drill. An experiment escaped from the facility, I repeat, an experiment escaped from the facility. To all personnel, evacuate further into the safe zone. I repeat, this is n...&quot;<br />\n<br />\nAnd it kept going, giving her a massve headache. ****ing pigs, she told herself, running towards the city. Would everything be ok ? Who did this ? How would they even know about this place ? Or more, why ? She didn\'t care and kept running until she was out of their sight.\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				<!-' + '- edit note -' + '->\r\n				<blockquote class="postcontent lastedited">\r\n					\r\n						Last edited by Lilith Von Boch; 01-25-2015 at <span class="time">08:28 PM</span>.\r\n					\r\n					\r\n				</blockquote>\r\n				<!-' + '- / edit note -' + '->\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="cleardiv"></div>\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n		<div class="postfoot">\r\n			<!-' + '- <div class="postfoot_container"> -' + '->\r\n			<div class="textcontrols floatcontainer">\r\n				<span class="postcontrols">\r\n					<img style="display:none" id="progress_3636093" src="images/misc/progress.gif" alt="" />\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n						<a id="qrwq_3636093" class="newreply" href="newreply.php?do=newreply&amp;p=3636093" rel="nofollow" title="Reply With Quote"><img id="quoteimg_3636093" src="clear.gif" alt="Reply With Quote" />  Reply With Quote</a> \r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n				</span>\r\n				<span class="postlinking">\r\n					\r\n						\r\n					\r\n\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n\r\n					\r\n					\r\n\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n				</span>\r\n			<!-' + '- </div> -' + '->\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div>\r\n	<hr />\r\n</li>\r\n';

Next stop, the executive\'s office. <br />\n<br />\nCharles started by putting the camera feed on a loop, to prevent himself from having to bother avoiding cameras. He walked out of the security office, checking the halls before walking out. Charles went straight for the stairs. After walking through the door and into the stairwell, he created a portal at the top of the stairwell, with the other side of the portal at his feet. He took one step into the portal and landed at the very top of the stairwell. He walked up to the door that led to that floor, put his eye up against it, and opened a portal in front of his eye. That portal led to the other side of the door. <span style="font-family: impact"><font color="#b22222">Peeping Tom</font></span>. After looking at the other side, he could see there were several security guards as well as many desk jockeys. Removing the portal from the door and putting it on the corner of the floor room, he could see the rest of the guards and employees. Finally, moving the portal to get a better view inside the Exec\'s office, he could see that the entire office was glass and everybody could see inside. He had to get in without being noticed. But how? <br />\n<br />\nThe desk inside was turned away from the entrance of the office. So the computer monitor was hidden from anyone not behind the desk. The keyboard and mouse were also hidden by random files and paperwork. Charles knew the only way to do this was to access the computer. But first thing\'s first. He had to hide himself somewhere besides the stairwell. And what better place to hide, than the roof. Charles made a portal that led to the roof, after entering, at the very same moment, two guards were walking up onto the roof for a smoke. With his superhuman reflexes, Charles ducked and hid behind an AC unit to keep from being seen. The guards however, still heard the noise, they grabbed their guns and decided to investigate. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;What are guards doing with guns?&quot; Charles thought to himself. Using portals, Charles grabbed one leg from both of the guards, pulling them into the ground and their legs up in front of him. They sunk real quick, and were freaking out because the lower half of their legs disappeared. Using another portal, Charles teleported behind the guards, grabbing a baton out from his dimension, he knocks the two guards out before they knew what happened. He removed their legs from the portals, and stripped them. Taking the guns, radios, and of course cash. He used their belts to tie their hands together behind their backs, and continued with the original plan.<br />\n<br />\nHe opened up a few small portals, one for his eyes, two for his hands. He was able to use the computer without being seen, but that\'s all he could do. He tightened his gloves, and then started the computer. After the computer started to boot up, he found that it was locked by a password. Thankfully, he came prepared for that. Taking out a usb from his pocket dimension, he plugged it into the computer, and a few seconds later the screen started to pixelate and suddenly it was at the desktop. <br />\n<br />\n<div style="text-align: center;">-<i>Several months back</i>- </div><br />\nSomeone from the TecFas distract paid Charles for information. For payment, Charles asked for a way to get access to any password protected desktop PC. After a week, Charles received a package from her, inside was a usb and note saying: &quot;<i>Use this - BL</i>&quot;. Since then, Charles has used this for a numerous amount of jobs, it has come in handy.<br />\n<br />\n<div style="text-align: center;"><i>-Back on the rooftop-<br />\n</i></div>Charles now has access to the exec\'s computer. Bringing up the exec\'s bank account, he saw how many digits Varrion really has in their pockets. Charles said &quot;<i>...Jackpot</i>&quot;. Not only were there millions of dollars that Charles could freely take for his own pleasures, but there were several cash transfers, leading to a string of fake bank accounts. Which could be traced for information about what exactly Varrion has been funding. Charles took it all, plugging in a second USB drive, he downloaded all the banking information he could. But right as he was about to transfer the money to his account, the alarms started to go off. Guards started running everywhere. The guards that Charles took out before had woken up already and radioed in, alarming everyone that there was an intruder. <br />\n<br />\nCharles was running out of time, but he didn\'t panic. He continued with the task at hand, and transferred a grand total of 1,000,000,000 units into an untraceable account Charles had setup. The transfer was complete when the guards came into the executive\'s office. He quickly grabbed the two USB\'s and returned his attention to the roof. He knew they\'d be up there soon. The doorknob was being turned, as Charles was getting ready to leave. Creating a portal at his feet, he dropped inside and landed safely inside his hotel room.<br />\n<br />\nHe stood there for a few seconds, and then dropped on the bed. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;****.. That was too close.&quot; <br />\n<br />\nHe rubbed his face and let out a deep sigh. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;Better finish the job before they find me.&quot; He said<br />\n<br />\nGrabbing a laptop he had in the room, he entered his bank account, and transferred all the money to a money launderer he knew from the TecFas distract in order to hide his tracks. Charles had successfully robbed one of the biggest and most powerful corporations. So to finish the job, he took a nap. <br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<div style="text-align: center;"><i>-Meanwhile in the executive\'s office-<br />\n<br />\n</i></div>The executive arrived back in his office after the alarms went off.

A few seconds later, in a rage, he shoved everything off his desk.

Reversing this would be a cinch given Varrion\'s private financial security, although the spending to outfit the buildings with better security systems would just be a hefty hit to the funds. Also, it wasn\'t like stolen money could be magically returned in it\'s entirety. If that thief was smart he would have divided his spoils, so here\'s to hoping the slippery bastard was slipshod. Maybe even they\'d drain the burglar who stole from them. No, those thoughts were toxic thinking. Varrion Coporation did not break the law. They played by the rules, always did and always will. However, when someone steals from Jessie Frankburg, it wasn\'t as if the water would remain still.<br />\n<br />\n(( Charles, I suggest you at the least try and save as much money as you can by moving it to different bank accounts. Jessie is going to get his cash back, at least a majority of it.

Next to it, a beautifully crafted building known as the Yvory Tower. A lot of people were walking inside, and there was a sign saying &quot;Charity event&quot;. Jo had no idea exactly what charity was supposed to be going on, but what he did know is that charity events have two things... Chairs... And air conditioning. He followed the crowd inside, people stared at the very tall man coming into the building.

Meaning he could easily carry them inside his pocket dimension, without them weighting him down. The other half stayed in his bank account. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;<i>If they come for me, hopefully the transfer records will serve as a good enough leverage to keep their dogs off my trail.

It was an odd hobby of trying to make friends with whoever you could, even if most of the time the recipient just crushed your with silence or an awkward glance.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Hey, welcome to the concert. Here\'s a pamphlet on what\'s going on. My name is Evan, may I ask what yours is?&quot;<br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile, in a parking garage located near the edge of the urban wards, Ash and his crew mobilized themselves. Isaiah and his comrades were clad in dark clothing, their leather jackets were armored from the inside with kevlar while their legs and waist held utility pouches of valuable ammunition and other equipment. Strapped onto their torsos were holsters for handguns, as well as miniature grenade bandoleers. The group wore balaclavas on their faces, as well as their shades from last night. Some even had personalized head apparel.<br />\n<br />\nThe two all-terrain vehicles from last night now had roof-mounted, light machine gun turrets, with armored plated walls that went around the gun to protect the operator. Everything about the vehicles screamed military heavy-industry, extensive modifications had been made to ensure that these two vehicles would behave similar to APCs. The truck that the Twisted Crown once used was parked between the two vehicles. Ash had a plan for the truck, it would be valuable near the end of the heist.<br />\n<br />\nA woman wearing a pair of pink-rimmed shades, and had hearts going across the side of her balaclava, approached Isaiah to speak with him. The man put gloves onto his hands, like the res to his compatriots, and turned to face the woman.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;What\'s the word with the boss? He still suicidal?&quot; the woman asked, her voice appeared to be Hispanic due to her accent. Isaiah shook his head and patted her on the shoulder. He then walked over to the passenger side door of Ash\'s vehicle, and opened it. With a curt glance to the woman Isaiah replied with,<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Occasionally. That\'s why I\'m here though.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe woman sighed and went over to the other vehicle. The entire group, about a dozen people, entered the vehicles. These professional thieves were well armored and extremely skilled in hand-to-hand combat as well as the use of firearms. Each possessed a couple specialized talents which assisted the others. Together, they were a united force of avarice and violence, and all had a personal motivation that inspired them to perform to their fullest. Varrion was their enemy, and they would be glad to kick the corporation in the balls and take its shoes.<br />\n<br />\nThe convoy of three drove up the ramp leading to the underground parking center, and smoothly entered the traffic of the city. From within his back seat, Ash placed his fingers between each other and relaxed his body. His closed eyes slowly opened to reveal his amber irises, which appeared to be gleaming in bold energy and furious spirit.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;It\'s time everyone. Remember, two groups, so two different exits, and two tails for the police to follow. Nobody here should be prepared to die, because we\'re going to walk out alive and well with money coming out of our arse.&quot; Isaiah eloquently spoke into his radio. He twisted his body to look at Ash in the back seat, as well as the two thieves who were at either of his side. After a moment of hesitation. Isaiah turned back in his seat and lightly exhaled.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Happy birthday, boss.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nIsaiah\'s Convoy consist of this type of vehicle, only it is longer and has mounted turrets.<br />\n<img src="http://www.sir-differel.com/images/pers-hummer-hx.jpg" border="0" alt="" />\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				<!-' + '- edit note -' + '->\r\n				<blockquote class="postcontent lastedited">\r\n					\r\n						Last edited by Shmuser Name; 01-27-2015 at <span class="time">09:29 AM</span>.\r\n					\r\n					\r\n				</blockquote>\r\n				<!-' + '- / edit note -' + '->\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font color="#333333">Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of <b>Alpha City</b>, the </font><font color="#0000ff">Tech District</font><font color="#333333">.

This commercial port was just one of a handful that made up the enormous docks of the waterfront. Multi-colored containers, huge white tanks, lines of heavy shipping vehicles, and an active hive of dock workers fed life into this noisy area. The smell of the salt-water, the communication of the workers, the call of the seagulls, and the screeching of metal along with the revving of engines created a gritty harmony of sound. This section of the docks was dedicated to handling the water\'s commerce, as oil and other goods were unloaded or exported frequently as the big-liners arrived. The huge building of the company managing these docks was settled at the edge of the pier, where it had a perfect view of the boardwalk.<br />\n<br />\nIt was this boardwalk that the ship Von was on was heading to, as that was where most passenger ships were assigned to go. There wasn\'t much of a congregation at the area...aside from a group of rugged looking men and women who appeared to have scared all others off. The group was outfitted in clothing that was similar to that of mafia street sweepers. Standing in the center of the gang was a peculiar man. His build was large and bulky, and his skin was a scaly-green complexion. He was dressed in a pair of dark-brown khakis and dress shoes, yet his torso was bare to display the tough scales covering his odd hide. His thick neck seemed to be possess gills. His nose seemed to have melded in with his face, and his mouth was wide and thin like that of a shark. His eye sockets each possessed three dirty-green eyes floating in black sclera, the center eyeball of the trios was the largest. His scalp appeared to be a smooth carapace, which had spiked fringes going along the distended sides of the entire head-case.<br />\n<br />\nIn a guttural and flangy voice, the man looked to his group and ordered,<br />\n<br />\n&quot;We don\'t need their business anymore, Santa\'s got a new nipple to suck money from. So with that in mind, let\'s show them that they\'re not welcome anymore.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThe man was handed a special harpoon weapon that appeared to possess a pair of barrels and a long magazine of spear ammunition. He smiled devilishly and revealed his rows of serrated teeth. The rest of the gang all managed to produce semi-automatic weapons, and took position at whatever cover they could find at the docks. The scaled man, without a single moment of hesitation, dived off of the boardwalk and plunged into the water. His webbed feet and hands fluidly assisted his body in jetting forwards in the cool, murky water.<br />\n<br />\nGiles was always one to take the fight to the enemy. If you weren\'t getting up in their face, then you had no legitimacy. It was this attitude that made him rise in the ranks of the Mafia as street muscle. Having a super-human like him was risky, as it was easy to identify the man, but he was damned effective and ensured that nothing dirty could ever be traced back to him. However, today was his chance to let loose, as the full protection and blessing of Santa himself was at his back.\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font color="#333333">Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of <b>Alpha City</b>, the </font><font color="#0000ff">Tech District</font><font color="#333333">.

He introduced himself, handed him a pamphlet and asked for Jo\'s name. Jo\'s shades slid down his nose, while he looked over them with a slight dismayed expression on his face. He snapped himself out of his dismay and pushed his shades back up his face. He stood there for a couple seconds in silence, then replied with a deep and calm voice; &quot;<i>Jo</i>&quot;<br />\n<br />\nJo was surprised to see someone who was in good spirit.

He walked over to his leather couch, stretching himself over it, with his head resting on the arm. He rolled up his sleeves and took out his smartphone. Opening a portal, out came a satellite phone. It had a small LCD screen, and the basic 0-9 buttons. This phone was made for calls only, and calls that couldn\'t be traced. He dialed a number, after hitting the call button a name came up on the LCD screen; Blacklist. He held the phone up against his face with his shoulder that was against the couch. With his right hand he reached over to a coffee table and grabbed a padded envelope. Opening a portal, out dropped a USB drive. It was a copy of the USB that he had downloaded the transfer records on. Dropping the USB into the envelope and sealing it, the phone call went to voice mail. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;<i>Hey, I\'m leaving an early Christmas present in your mailbox.

Reaching over to the coffee table again, he grabbed the remote and turned on the television to the mystery channel.

She even felt a twinge of fear at how well the man was at getting things done, so it was fantastic that she was on friendly terms with her contact. Riya had been clad in a bath towel, ringing her moist hair out in her bedroom when her smartphone rumbled to inform her of a new email.<br />\n<br />\nRiya was pleasantly surprised to see it was from her contact, who apparently had a gift for her. After running the mail through various security programs, Riya then downloaded the information. She could trust the man, but it was better to be safe than sorry. Riya reviewed her voice-mail and the marvelous wealth of corporate information that had been shared with her. When she noticed that this information belonged to a Varrion employee, especially one with enough security clearance to have access to this data, she instantly began to freak out. Riya sent a quick e-mail back to Charles, her concern was evident.<br />\n<br />\nShe had just been gifted something incredibly appetizing, but it was also dangerous. Blacklist wasn\'t afraid to get her hands dirty and take risks, but against Varrion?! It was too rewarding to pass up, as corporate espionage was a big bill business. Yet the fear of the repercussions was also apparent. For now, Riya would do a rare thing...she would act like a safe for Charles\'s data, even thought the temptation to sell it for herself was high. Her contact was a good man, and Riya wasn\'t that slimy.\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font color="#333333">Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of <b>Alpha City</b>, the </font><font color="#0000ff">Tech District</font><font color="#333333">.

The moon was waxing and was just a day away from being full. It had rained recently, the ground still wet and muddy. There were rusted over cars, trash bags, steel barrels. In the middle a pit. Charles looked up, with one eye blinded by blood dripping from his forehead. He saw many fires, burning piles of trash, or makeshift tiki lamps. The fire illuminated the pit, showing the disgusting filth surrounding him. A figure standing before him, his face was hidden by the glow of the fire behind him. Charles\' vision was blurry at best. He struggled to lean forward, but he was tied down with his hands behind his back. The mysterious figure leaned in and grabbed Charles chin, lifting his head up so they were looking straight at each other. &quot;<i>You took something from me, so I think it\'s only fair to take something back.</i>&quot; the stranger said. He reached behind himself, pulling out a gun and turning in the direction Charles was facing. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;<i>Say goodbye.</i>&quot; <br />\n<br />\n<font size="3"><span style="font-family: impact"><i>BAANG!</i></span></font><br />\n<br />\nHe couldn\'t make out who, but blood started to run towards Charles knees. In a tone of unbelief, he started to cry. &quot;<i>No... No! NO!</i>&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<span style="font-family: impact"><i>DING!</i></span><br />\n<br />\n&quot;<i>Sh*t... Was I dreaming?</i>&quot;<br />\n<br />\non the coffee table was his laptop, on the screen there was a notification telling him he had recently received mail. He wiped his eyes and sat up on the couch, followed by a big yawn. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;<i>Looks like Blacklist got my message</i>&quot;<br />\n<br />\nBlacklist. Charles\' go to girl for all things information. He had worked with her on multiple occasions, either selling or buying. Both a mystery to each other, as they\'ve never met in person. Charles always lit up whenever he got the chance to broker a deal with Blacklist. To him, it was the next best thing to going on a spending spree with someone else\'s money. He knew he could trust her, because like himself, information was more than a source of money. It was a way of life. Sometimes it was the only reason they were still alive. But still, he couldn\'t help worry she might get hunted down by some Varrion dogs for being connected to him, especially after what he just pulled.<br />\n<br />\nCharles kept reassuring himself that even if Varrion managed to pull off a miracle and locate him, that he could bluff his way out or if worse comes to worse... run. After all, the world\'s never seen a better escape artist.\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				<!-' + '- edit note -' + '->\r\n				<blockquote class="postcontent lastedited">\r\n					\r\n						Last edited by 4xdblack; 01-26-2015 at <span class="time">03:31 PM</span>.\r\n					\r\n					\r\n				</blockquote>\r\n				<!-' + '- / edit note -' + '->\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i.gyazo.com/f9dff1c9a8631a826009a5e9ad46996f.png" border="0" alt="" /></div><br />\n<div style="text-align: center;">&quot;<i>Glory lies beyond the horizon.

She was carrying a damned rifle, a katana and her scout knife. Going right and left, she was lost. She did not know this part of the city, nor any of them. She was out in the open and it didn\'t take long that she kept saying the same people, following her. They were too obvious, walking fast when she did, taking the same routes and trying to fake cough and talk ? Too old, she had to move out of their sight now. Her heart began to race, adrenaline began to rush through out her veins, she made a run for it and so did they.<br />\n<br />\nPushing people aside, trying to make her way through the crowds, looking for a escape route. The street lights had turned red on her side, it was her opportunities to cross. She ran across, sliding on one of the passing car\'s hood, making it stop midway, slowing down her pursuers. She kept running until she came across an apartment, it didn\'t look populated, her queue out of here. Entering the building, she made her way up a few floors, and stopped at the first door she met. She had a few tricks for these kind of doors, unless they\'ve changed. Taking her scout knife out, she busted the lock, opening the door right away and closing it behind her.<br />\n<br />\nShe could finally breath, but she did not feel at ease. She was in someone\'s else place, she felt terrible for doing this. But surviving was her top priority for now.

The staff that he held it by was a straight carbon fiber pole. It was black. The blade on the end was expertly polished, and slowly curved down the further down the blade you got. The end of the blade was fatter than the side that was attached to the pole. The razor sharp blade on the inside of the curve. It was very plain, as it had no designs, but it was spotless. It was a scary weapon to have to face down. Especially when your neck was inside the curve of the blade.<br />\n<br />\nShe had a Katana, a large rifle, and a field knife.

She didn\'t seem like a Varrion dog, but someone who was running from something. But he still couldn\'t trust her, considering how well armed she was.

From there, the intelligence group working for Varrion compiled a list of possible suspects. Seeing how there was no physical images or video captured of the suspect, it was all just educated guesswork in tracking down the culprit. Jessie Frankburg looked the list over and personally decided who would be getting a visit from his own, elite section of paramilitary goons. Varrion Corporation private security were not blood-hounds, but they weren\'t just pawns for the mega-corporation\'s executives as well.<br />\n<br />\nJessie then acquired an anonymous person to telephone the police department, and give an anonymous tip of a bomb threat at each location which held a suspect. The police would cordon the area off and assist in trapping the prey, while Jessie\'s paramilitary would move in to monitor the situation with the authority of the largest, government-backed corporation in the nation.<br />\n<br />\nThe angles and blunt faces of the armored vehicles speeding towards Charles\'s apartment complex were a staple design of the SWAT police force of Alpha City. Within these five large metal trucks were armored officers and unmanned bomb drones. The airspace above the city was a no-fly zone, so Varrion had to inject their grunts in by road. In their own armored personnel carrier.

The anonymous tip had said that anyone could be the bomb-maker, so detaining and evacuating every inhabitant was a necessary but time-consuming process. Meanwhile, Varrion personnel stormed the building in neat units of men. to the begrudging suspicion of the SWAT officers. Apparently, the local authority of the police was inferior to the sway that Varrion had. However, the company was more on a friendly and cooperative basis with the police rather than a competitive one.<br />\n<br />\nThe private military grunts knew exactly where to go. They had their target, and were also informed about how the bomb threat was a decoy. The police presence would help lock the area down for Varrion to swoop down and apprehend their suspect, like opportunistic vultures. Armored men and women filed into a single line headed directly to Charles\'s apartment. They were well-armed and skilled mercenaries, but not impossible to overcome.<br />\n<br />\n<i>Varrion Corporation HQ - TecFas District<br />\n<br />\n</i>Isaiah\'s convoy headed down to the underground tunnels that led to the parking garages that spread out beneath the region. There was hefty vehicle traffic as well as plenty of civilian foot-traffic within the region. Intersections and wide streets stretched on for quite a distance in each direction, overlooked by enormous towers and even larger skyscrapers. The crown of the ward was Varrion Corporation\'s HQ building, a goliath skyscraper which served multiple purposes. Near-by was the Yvory Tower, a grandiose rec center which was frequently used as a pavilion for numerous special events and occasions.<br />\n<br />\nThe convoy smoothly entered down into the parking garage, and headed for Varrion Corporation\'s private parking elevator. It was heavily guarded by armored paramilitary stationed at a security checkpoint. The graffiti on the truck stood out within this decently illuminated underground stadium. When the guards witnessed the convoy approaching, they began to tense up.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Alright, boss. You get the first play. Time to shine, mate.&quot; Isaiah remarked, cocking the lever to his sub-machine gun. Ash cleared his throats and exhaled loudly, sounding powerful yet calm. The window to the right of him was rolled down by his comrade, and Ash unbuckled his seat-belt. The man patted Isaiah on the shoulder, and then jumped towards the open door.<br />\n<br />\nWithin a second, Ash\'s body had become a malleable swarm of volcanic ash particles. These tiny, jagged, and solid grains moved at incredibly fast speeds. Ash could choose what parts of his body to transform, although he usually went all out and became a hellish cloud of ash that could shred or corrode apart any material it smashed against. The black and red, glowing swarm of volcanic ash flew towards the security checkpoint. Gunfire from the guards tore through the swarm, but the bullets simply eroded away into flecks of metal.<br />\n<br />\nWith screams of terror, the guards had their uniforms and flesh shredded and burned as Ash charged at them in back and forth patterns. Ash\'s gang watched on with completely stoic, covered faces as their boss went on his rampage. Eventually only terribly defaced, half-skeletal corpses were left on the floor. Ash transformed himself back into a man after he ended his slaying. He was a middle-aged Caucasian male. Ash had a medium build and lanky limbs, and was dressed in a dark-gray jacket and maroon trousers. His neck had a long, tattered scarf of dark-reed fabric that flowed down to his back. Ash\'s head was hairless, his amber eyes and black goatee gave his good-looking face a devilish appearance.<br />\n<br />\nThe man turned back to the convoy gestured for them to come. The security checkpoint had alerted the building\'s security that a suspicious, unscheduled convoy had arrived before they died. Ash and Isaiah knew that the entry was going to be rocky and violent, but they were confident in their ability. Ash had entered Isaiah\'s all-terrain-vehicle before using the elevator.<br />\n<br />\nThe convoy went up the ramp leading to the elevators, and one by one each vehicle took the lift up to the surface-level. Now the group was within Varrion\'s secure perimeter, and would have a difficult job exiting the area due to all the guards and defense systems.<br />\n&quot;Excellent job. Alright, everyone. Remember, one team packs more guns and holds off the police and Varrion\'s private security. The other team has the equipment used to bust the vault. Afterwards, ground team will leave via convoy while the vault team takes the helicopter. I\'ll be in charge of diverting the attention away from the vault team. The boss will be leading the bank busters.&quot; Isaiah commanded, speaking smoothly into his radio.<br />\n<br />\nThe team in charge of fighting the police and paramilitary security details was larger than the group tasked with robbing the vault. However, Ash was on the vault team and was considered to be worth twenty men.<br />\n<br />\nInstead of a sneaky approach, with the thieves dressed up as Varrion employees who would attack from the inside, the group would storm the building and lock it down. Hostages would be shepherded to the bottom few floors, while the vault team would locate the money and steal it all. Everyone exited their vehicles and prepared their weapons. A few bulky men carried the heavy equipment needed to break into the vault and disable security systems in large, armored cases. All except for Ash had their heads covered in balaclavas and shades, and wore duffel bags.<br />\n<br />\nIsaiah and Ash nodded to one another, and then began to head to the exit of the parking garage. Already there were fragile barricades and gates established by the first line of Varrion\'s private security. These men and women were simple guards who lightly armored and lightly equipped. The more military-like security details were mobilizing, and would be here soon.<br />\n<br />\n<i>The Docks and Port - Glam District<br />\n<br />\n</i>Giles swam towards the underbelly of the boat, his face twisted into an expression of psychotic bloodlust. He formed a fist and smashed his hand through the boat\'s hull, pulling it out so that water could begin flooding the boat. Afterwards, Giles swam to the side of the boat and sprang up onto its edge. He grabbed onto the boat and swung his body up onto the long deck, with beads of water pattering down his skin and onto the floor.<br />\n<br />\nGiles raised his weapon and laughed with glee as he fired a thick harpoon directly into a man\'s chest. The stranger jerked backwards and fell with the bloody harpoon jutting out from the back of his torso.\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				<!-' + '- edit note -' + '->\r\n				<blockquote class="postcontent lastedited">\r\n					\r\n						Last edited by Shmuser Name; 01-27-2015 at <span class="time">02:26 PM</span>.\r\n					\r\n					\r\n				</blockquote>\r\n				<!-' + '- / edit note -' + '->\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font color="#333333">Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of <b>Alpha City</b>, the </font><font color="#0000ff">Tech District</font><font color="#333333">.

Afterwards, he reached over to his laptop on the brown coffee table, flipping the laptop upside down. He pulled out the hard drive, that was designed to simply slide out. He dropped the hard drive inside his pocket dimension. Then dropping out another hard drive, he replaced the last one on his laptop. Setting the laptop on the table, he leaned back with his feet rested and took another sip of his beer.<br />\n<br />\nThinking to himself &quot;<i>You better be there when I come back.

Looking around, but there was no law enforcement vehicles driving towards the building with their sirens on. Seems strange that social media can get news out faster than the authorities could send out officers.

She was confuse for a bit, everything happened so suddenly, did he just give her a chance ? **** that sh1t, she wasn\'t about giving out chances, especially not so quickly. Putting the phone away in her pocket, she followed the sirens back to the man\'s place. It was on lock down, officers and Varrion\'s private military forces were keeping an eye all around the building. They wouldn\'t send so many forces for just her, they would send their special forces, something fishy was going on.<br />\n<br />\nLooking around, what could she do to attract attention ? A frontal assault, suicidal, but possible to get out alive. Smirking, she began to move forward onto the crowd, she stole a pack of cigarette and a light along the way, already making a fuss. Lighting one up, she putted everything on her pocket and moved quickly before the crowd heated up. She had her hand on her scout knife, she didn\'t hide her weapons what so ever and people were scared. She loved the sensation it gave to her, the attention out of fear, she felt like she ruled them. She approached one of the officers, his pistol in his holster, she had her window.<br />\n<br />\n\'\'Mam\' you can p... SHE H...\'\'<br />\n<br />\nNot letting the man finish to warn his pig friends, she attack him right away. Taking her knife away, she jabbed him once, making him dizzy from the surprise attack. Turning him around, she grabbed him from behind using her left arm, placing her knife on his throat. She used her right hand to take his pistol out, all of this in a flash, that beer felt really good and she felt... Like herself for once. Slowly moving towards one of the trucks, it took a single moment for all of his friends to turn around, trying to surround her. Some of them were calling for back up, probably pulling out the men inside, most of them. She didn\'t know if it worked, but that was probably enough for the man to make his escape.<br />\n<br />\nThey yelled and yelled, but she simply kept walking back to one of the truck, using it for cover if needed. The cigarette still on her lips, she opened fire, not directly at them, she wouldn\'t just kill them either, unless she had to. She loved killing, but right now, it wasn\'t the best of idea. She sprayed everywhere until one bullet was left in the chamber, she kept that one for the man\'s window, a sign to tell him to leave now, maybe he would understand. Shooting at his window, he didn\'t seem to be looking, or maybe he understood already. Click click, bullet\'s out, time to run, after a puff.<br />\n<br />\nSlicing the officer\'s throat, they opened fire at her, considering their friend was dead, it didn\'t matter anymore. She side stepped to the side, sitting her back on the truck to take a good puff. Life was great right now, a cigarette and a beer, man she felt really good. Looking back at the apartment, she could see officers going down the stairs, but she couldn\'t count how many with all the bullets flying towards her. She gave a last glance at the window, she wished for his safety. After all, she owed him a lot. Realizing the officers were getting closer, now was the time to leave. A back alley was right in front of her, she felt a bit energized, but not enough to keep her ability up for long, it was a one shot.<br />\n<br />\nClosing her eyes for a split second, the gun shots stopped, now was the time. Cloaking up, leaving a small black screen of smoke behind, she ran like hell in the alley. Turning left and right, she could hear them getting in a few trucks, some running at her, others probably staying to keep order, she was in deep ****, but she knew it would be ok. As she kept running, now visible, she came across many doors, which she all opened, making many possibilities for them to explore, she had to be smart about this.

I forgot to tell her my name...</i>&quot;<br />\n<br />\nA minute later, the troops busted down the door and was yelling commands at him. Charles had registered the bank account and apartment under a false name. But the same name. So he knew whatever he did would be pinned on one Alexander Franklin, and not the now filthy rich Charles. Charles left his head down, as he slowly stood up raising his hands. They were yelling at him, ordering him to identify himself. Using a version of <font color="#b22222"><span style="font-family: impact">Peeping Tom</span></font>, Charles checked out the room. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;<i>These guys aren\'t law enforcement, they\'re Varrion. Damn! They work fast</i>&quot; He thought to himself. &quot;<i>What to do, what to do. I could go with them and try to throw the suspicion off me. Though it would suck if they found out while I was in their custody. I could take them out and let Varrion chase poor Alex to their hearts content. But then I\'d be forced to leave this wonderful apartment. Well, it\'s not like it\'s the first time I\'ve had to move after a score.</i>&quot; Only a few seconds had passed, as Charles mind was racing at incredible speeds.<br />\n<br />\nIt was then when there was yelling outside of his apartment. The Varrion dogs acted a little confused and two out of the 10 walked to the window to check it out. Gun shots started to ring out. Somebody was causing a distraction.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;<i>That damn girl. Oh well, looks like there\'s no turning back.</i>&quot; Charles said with a huge grin.<br />\n<br />\nAt the time, only three guns were aimed at him. There were two in the door way. Two behind Charles at the window, no more than a meter away. Three at 12, 3, and 10 o\'clock. One standing behind the three at 11 o\'clock talking into his radio. And two others clearing the bedroom. There was the couch on his right and table on his left. Two were women. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;<i>Let\'s have some fun.</i>&quot; He said out loud. <br />\n<br />\nAbove his hand, he opened a portal going to the side arm on the guy with the radio. Reaching up with his left hand and grabbing the side arm he pulled it out and fired at the ceiling. A bullet flew through his window, hitting the left arm of the guy on the right of the window. Even Charles was a little surprised, but it didn\'t slow his reflexes. Lowering his arm and turning back, he shoots the guy on the left of the window in the back on the right. Swinging forward and shooting the other guy at the window in the center of his chest. <br />\n<br />\nThe Three who had their guns aimed at him snapped out of their confusion from the earlier shot through the window and started to open fire at Charles. Opening a portal, he caught all the bullets, redirecting them into the bedroom with the other two guards. You could hear them cry out as they were hit. Before they even hit the ground, the three open firing ran out of ammo. <br />\n<br />\nThey dropped their mags and were reloading as fast as they could. putting down the portal, Charles swung the gun at the three, they hesitated for a second at reloading and ducked trying to avoid the line of fire. Charles placed two shots above their heads hitting the two guys in the door. Hitting the exact same spot, the center of their chest. <br />\n<br />\nBy then the guy on the radio had dropped his radio and reached for his side arm, which was no longer there. It took him a few seconds to realize it was gone. Before he could reach for his assault rifle, Charles opened a portal to his scythe into his right hand. Cutting the triggers out of the rifles without hitting the fingers of the Varrion dogs. <br />\n<br />\nThey finished reloading, and started to open fire. But they soon realized they couldn\'t. Before they could figure out why, Charles swung the scythe behind him and the pistol in front of him. Three shots placed perfectly in the center of their chests. <br />\n<br />\nHearing the sound of two falling in the bedroom, it was soon followed by the sound of the three in front of Charles. The guy with the radio who was obviously the mission leader had his assault rifle trained on Charles but he didn\'t fire. Because Charles had opened a portal, with his arm extended straight out, the gun was pressing against the back of the Varrion dog\'s back.<br />\n<br />\nThe last remaining trooper swallowed. Sweat rolling down his face. &quot;<i>Who the hell are you?</i>&quot; he said. With a small chuckle and grin, Charles replied &quot;<i>Filthy rich.</i>&quot;. The trooper tilted his head slightly letting out a questioning tone. Taking that chance, Charles pulled the trigger. Shooting the man on the right side from behind. <br />\n<br />\nAll that, in a matter of 20 seconds.<br />\n<br />\nWith that, Charles opened some portals, dropping the gun and scythe inside then reaching for his things. Hat, glasses, jacket and such. Opening a portal that led him to the roof of the building directly across. He looked at the building and the window his apartment was. He held his right hand up and snapped. The window that did have a bullet hole was suddenly a perfect window. Charles turned around and dropped himself into a portal heading towards the safe house.<br />\n<br />\n<div style="text-align: center;"><i>-Back at the apartments-</i></div><br />\nBy the time the law enforcement cleared all the levels of the building, they found on the forth floor a room full of shot private military soldiers from Varrion. In a room not registered to one Alex Franklin, but rather a Sarah Moon. Charles had prepared for a moment like this way in advance when he paid rent for the first time. Charles had rented out two apartment rooms, room 402 and room 204. Alex, who owned the bank account, was registered to room 204. However, the apartment Charles was actually staying in was room 402. Leaving a portal in the door that led to the opposite room.<br />\n<br />\nWhen the law enforcement reached them, every last one of them was surprisingly still alive but unconscious. Even after having been shot. The bullets hit just to the right of their hearts, not damaging anything vital. They weren\'t going to be able to go out into the field for a while however. <br />\n<br />\n<div style="text-align: center;"><i>-Back with Charles-</i></div><br />\nCharles arrived at the safe house that was in a discrete location. He entered the passcode and walked inside. Heading straight for the fridge, he grabbed out a chilled beer and walked over to the leather couch. Pulling the sheet covering the couch. He sat down and rested his feet on the coffee table in front of him. The ware house was dark but showed just enough dim light from the hanging lamps to reveal all the furniture and walls. Using his smartphone he turned on the Tv, and using a portal he pulled off the cover. Tuning the television onto the morning news.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;<i>I hope she makes it.</i>&quot; He thought. <br />\n<br />\nHe pulled out his satellite phone and called Blacklist. She answered the phone, but she could finish her first sentence, Charles interrupted her saying &quot;<i>You don\'t happen to know how to attach a trojan horse to money? If so, I think I have a plan for Varrion that we would both really enjoy.</i>&quot;\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i.gyazo.com/f9dff1c9a8631a826009a5e9ad46996f.png" border="0" alt="" /></div><br />\n<div style="text-align: center;">&quot;<i>Glory lies beyond the horizon.

Panting heavily, she was holding her hand on her stomach, now stained in blood. While she ran, a bullet made it\'s way through her, but she didn\'t know until recently. She slowly made her way to the door, barely entering the password itself. The lights were already on, blinding her view as she hid the light from her face with her other hand. Closing the door behind her, she almost fell on one knee, barely standing up. Her vision became faint, slowly fading away, but she didn\'t give up yet.<br />\n<br />\n\'\'Hey... You here ? Kinda... Uhm... Bleeding... A bit.\'\'<br />\n<br />\nSlowly standing up, holding herself on the wall, she walked towards noises she could hear from another room. She could hear her own weak hearbeat, pumping blood, for what was left of it. Unstrapping her rifle, it fell on the ground, taking weight off her back, already felt better. Her mind also became weaker, slowly breaking her.<br />\n<br />\n\'\'They bled... Like pigs... HAHAHAHAHAHA.\'\'<br />\n<br />\nHer Machiavelli laugh resonated through out the apartment, making it awkwardly silent. She felt cold, out of this world, of their league. She wanted more, yet her body was pushed beyond it\'s limit, for a normal human. She kept walking, falling onto something, a wall, she didn\'t know, she felt tired, resting on what ever was holding her now. Her body told her rest, he mind told her to stay awake. But she had nothing for the entire day, barely any drink and nothing to heat besides one ration. She devoured those back in the days, always hungry, also very angry and annoyed. Being mentally unstable never helped her case back in the special forces, they always feared her, looked at her like a monster, can\'t blame them.<br />\n<br />\n\'\'I...

It was then that the villain noticed Von come out from the lower deck.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Little one? Small fry for the Sharkodile.&quot; Giles menacingly joked, referring to himself. He raised his harpoon gun and fired a spear at Von, aiming for the boy\'s torso.<br />\n<br />\n<i>Varrion Corporation HQ - TecFas District<br />\n<br />\n</i>The group of thieves sprinted towards the exit to the parking garage, noticing the rays of sunlight streaming down from the ramp into the dark garage, bouncing off the gleaming luxury vehicles parked within the area. Isaiah and two other thieves ran over and crouched behind the side of a gray car. The balaclava that Isaiah possessed had a fancy, double-stenciled crucifix running down the center of it. His comrades also had customized balaclavas, one had a snarling and toothy grin of a Cacodemon while the other was covered in multi-colored eyeballs of varying sizes.<br />\n<br />\nThe other thieves followed suit and took cover at the vehicles, yet the light security dispatched to the scene began to fire their weapons onto the intruders. Bullets pinged off of the surfaces of their cover, or tore right through, as the Varrion first-response team fired hang-guns at the criminals with volleys of hot rounds. The thieves waited for a break in fire, and took turns rising to return a barrage of automatic gunfire at the security guards. Bullets smashed and chipped away at the fencing, roadblocks, as well as the body armor of the exposed guards. Blood trails streamed across the floor as ejected shells landed onto the ground and bounced, flashing as muzzle flares and gunfire exploded within the region like fireworks.<br />\n<br />\nAsh had been hiding behind a sedan, and decided to rush at the guards after a small break in fire. The group of ethnically diverse guards reloaded their weapons and tried to move forwards to suppress the group, but ultimately were left exposed. The handguns that the guards possessed had special smart-scopes which outlined where the thieves were hiding behind their cover. When Ash turned into his cloud of jagged volcanic particles, they could not identify what he was. Ash flew towards them and instantly ripped asunder their armor, clothing, and flesh. Blood splattered all over the region as horrific cries of agony rang out in the parking garage. The thieves mobilized and headed towards the exit, walking in a military like formation.<br />\n<br />\nAsh returned to his human form on top of a security jeep, sitting on its roof as his legs relaxed onto the windshield.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Alright, the grunts were dispatched. Vault team, follow me to the elevators. Good luck you lot, give them hell.&quot; Ash ordered. Isaiah wordlessly nodded to the man and signaled for his large chunk of the thieves to follow. They would be facing heavily armored, well equipped Varrion paramilitary as well as unmanned drones and intense security systems. However, a few grenades developed by a secret benefactor would come in handy in disrupting the electronics of the security systems. In the mean time, Ash would lead his team on their bloody warpath to the vault, taking a quieter route rather than the populated, exposed entrance and lobby area that Isaiah was creeping into.<br />\n<br />\nAlready APCs were driving over the campus, jumping rails and mowing down bushes as they left deep, curvy tire-trails into the lush soil behind them. They were only barely setting up a defensive perimeter when Isaiah and his crew rushed over to the stone architecture of the campus and took cover. Ash and his vault team were still underground, having used a service elevator to climb up into a maintenance warehouse. A small patrol of Varrion private military, complimented by a few flying automatic-turret drones, had recently arrived to secure the region. Ash looked to his group and silently commanded for them to find cover, as his arm and face began to transform into the familiar shape of his swirling swarm of volcanic ash.\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font color="#333333">Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of <b>Alpha City</b>, the </font><font color="#0000ff">Tech District</font><font color="#333333">.

Charles got up and walked towards the other room where the entrance was located. The thick steel door started to close and against a wall was the mysterious girl from earlier. She looked worse than before. Before Charles could speak, she said something and let out an unyielding laughter. She started to fall forwards, but before she could move another step Charles had teleported right in front of her, holding her against his chest. He heard the sound of her blood dip onto the floor. <br />\n<br />\n&quot;Maybe I should have given you kevlar instead of that beer.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nShe started to lose consciousness, as she mumbled something. Putting her right arm around him, and then picking her up he opened a portal into the bedroom that was connected to the living room. He set her on the bed, reaching over to the bedside table and turning on the lamp. She was in bad condition. Dehydration, exhaustion, on top of suffering blood loss. <br />\n<br />\nCharles quickly grabbed the medical kit to treat her wound.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;The bullet went straight through.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nHe removed her weapons and pulled up her shirt, revealing the wound. After sterilizing it, he stopped the bleeding and wrapped the wound in bandages. The med kit came with an IV that Charles used to help with the dehydration. He checked for signs of internal bleeding. After all was said and done, he left her to sleep on the bed while he went back into the kitchen to prepare some food. <br />\n<br />\n__________________________________________________  __________________________________________<br />\n<br />\nThe safe house was a one bedroom one bath hidden in a warehouse. Out of 5 doors inside, only one led to the actual safe house. The safe house was about the size of a small mobile home. With no windows, the walls and floor were made of thick, smooth concrete that hid any heat signatures and was thick enough to stop even the strongest firearms. To the left was the Kitchen, to the right was the living room followed by bedroom and bath.<br />\n<br />\n<img src="http://i.gyazo.com/6b36359346ea118e2757919e679c65a1.png" border="0" alt="" /><br />\n<br />\nEnter anywhere else in the safe house, and you wont find this room anywhere. However, the safe house itself had 3 total exits. The front door, the roof, and a secret underground room that led to tunnels. The rest of the warehouse was a decoy meant to throw off any intruders, allowing for Charles to escape in the unlikely scenario someone could find it. <br />\n<br />\nAfter all, Charles specifically chose the building because it had been abandoned for years in an area with minimal security, and the owners sold the property with a simple cash trade. It was the perfect place for someone who wanted to hide.<br />\n<br />\n__________________________________________________  ____________________________<br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile, Charles let the girl rest and recover, and in her lead he continued his nap.\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i.gyazo.com/f9dff1c9a8631a826009a5e9ad46996f.png" border="0" alt="" /></div><br />\n<div style="text-align: center;">&quot;<i>Glory lies beyond the horizon.

Unfortunately, a few wounded Varrion personnel bled out from their wounds before they could be treated. However, the body armor and physical constitution of the other trained mercenaries was enough to keep them alive until the EMTs arrived and administered life-saving first-aid. When Jessie got the report, he was livid. The suspect that escaped was a super-human, and appeared to be the man Jessie was looking for. The Varrion grunts provided eye-witness reports on his appearance, and with the wide net of information that Varrion could tap into the Intelligence Department was on the hunt for any signs of the thief.<br />\n<br />\nJessie was upset at the loss of precious Varrion soldiers. They were top-of-the-line mercenaries, and he knew his personal detachment of thugs quite well. More dour funerals to go to later on.<br />\n<br />\nJessie Frankburg was under the impression that Varrion was a corporate paragon of influence and justice in this world of imbalance. Unbeknownst to him, Varrion kept their secrets hidden well and out of public sight while they fed their own employees and the world about all the good they did. A national behemoth like Varrion was also expanding globally, which was viewed as a financial success to the naive executives of the corporation. Jessie was proud to be a CEO, and the Glam district was his playground. The Intelligience Department would cover the police as they investigated more of the anonymous caller who faked the threat. The curious nature of the local law enforcement was also becoming apparent. Their interest had been piqued at the fatal disaster which was the Varrion apartment raid, which resulted in human lives being lost to especially odd circumstances.<br />\n<br />\nVarrion would succeed in hiding the fact that a super-human had been the cause of the issue, there was no point in feeding in to the violence or discrimination. Also, the upper echelon of the local law enforcement would need to intervene is a super-human was involved in deaths. That was just more trouble that Varrion didn\'t need. The police were on their guard though, and would be keeping a closer eye on Varrion\'s dealing within the Glam District.<br />\n<br />\nThis information was fostered into secrecy quite well, but not everything can be hidden from the light. Luminary had managed to catch onto this suspicious event, and he too added it to his list of investigation. A super-human and Varrion private military? It was most definitely not just a coincidence, there was something more here. Something that Varrion, his previous employer, wanted to brush under the rug.\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				<!-' + '- edit note -' + '->\r\n				<blockquote class="postcontent lastedited">\r\n					\r\n						Last edited by Shmuser Name; 01-31-2015 at <span class="time">09:46 AM</span>.\r\n					\r\n					\r\n				</blockquote>\r\n				<!-' + '- / edit note -' + '->\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font color="#333333">Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of <b>Alpha City</b>, the </font><font color="#0000ff">Tech District</font><font color="#333333">.

The super-villain who leads the group is a man named Ash, who has the power to transform into a malleable and incredibly quick cloud of jagged, insolvable volcanic ash particles. The thieves have split into two teams, with the larger team (led by Isaiah) behaving as a decoy for the smaller team (led by Ash) to attack the vaults. Two important figures who are in the area are Jo and Evander.<br />\n<br />\nIn the Glam district, Makila has escaped from confinement and circumstances led her to be sheltered by Charles. The man had recently stolen a vast amount of money from a Varrion executive named Jessie Frankburg. Jessie is now on the hunt for Charles after a failed raid onto his apartment. The police want to get invovled, but Varrion\'s Intelligence Department are fending them off and keeping things clean. Makil and Charles are now safe in a warehouse.<br />\n<br />\nAt the Docks and Port, a Mafia street-cleaning gang had been awaiting a ship. This ship was carrying immigrants into Alpha city illegally, and was also known for trafficking drugs to the Mafia. Now that the Mafia, led by an anonymous person named &quot;Santa&quot;, has access to funding from an undisclosed source, they want to permanently get rid of their old debts and shaky allegiances. To handle this situation, under the full protection of the Mafia organization and the anonymous backer of the group, was a super-villain named Giles. He and his crew now assault the ship, tasked with simply getting rid of anything they want that relates to the extermination.<br />\n<br />\nLuminary is investigating the disappearance of Rodney Gilligan, and is also interested by the failed apartment raid which resulted in the death of Varrion personnel. Apparently, a super-human was involved, and Luminary feels obligated to ensure that no other regular humans are ever involved in a grim situation with a super-human. Luminary is also one of very few people who know a bit of Varrion\'s darkside, but he waits for a proper opportunity to reveal the truth about the corporation without the Intelligence Department covering everything up or erasing the information.<br />\n<br />\nSin Shaman is preparing a magical ritual of sorts to identify and combat whatever dark forces and black magic is infecting the Glam District as of the moment.\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font color="#333333">Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of <b>Alpha City</b>, the </font><font color="#0000ff">Tech District</font><font color="#333333">.

Stepping out of the vehicle, Edmond looked towards the direction of the Varrion entrance. Normally that area of the parking structure was gated off, only allowing very specific vehicles and drivers to use the elevator. Any normal person trying to get in was usually dealt with immediately and efficiently from well trained guards, as expected from the esteemed banking company. However, this time the entrance was in ruins after that one man cut them all down.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Shall I wait for you here?&quot; asked Edmond\'s Chauffeur, standing straight standing next to the drivers side door. Edmond looked at him and then nodded. &quot;I will not be long. There is a prize that I might find most useful.&quot; Looking back at the elevator Edmond walked over, side stepping a severed arm as he made his way to the elevator, the more personal one at the side designed for security personnel, not vehicles. As the elevator began to close its doors, the security doors began to close as well, preventing further access to the upper level by unauthorized personnel.<br />\n<br />\nAs the reaching the inner walls of Varrion, Edmond stepped to the side pushed the emergency stop button. preventing the doors from opening. The ringing of gun shots off metal could be heard through the doors. Every now and then one would ping off the door itself. Edmond waited for the sounds to stop and then waited a little longer before allowing the elevator to finish its climb and opening the doors. The scene was a mess. Luxury cars were all damaged and several of them were stained in blood.<br />\n<br />\nEdmond continued his stroll as he walked up a second path to ground level.

Von realised he had to keep this piranha occupied until his partner came up with a plan.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;What\'s the matter. Don\'t you wanna play with Daddy?&quot;<br />\n<br />\nVon maintained his distance. One wrong move and he\'d me meat on a spear. A moment of silence prevailed.

Lets see how funny you find it to be after I rip your throat.&quot; But before Giles could make his move a searing pain in his head stopped him dead in his tracks. His vision started to grow blurry. With each click that Von made with his fingers Giles felt a hammer smash his head. The sound waves emanating from Von had temporarily interrupted the normal functioning of Giles brain rendering him motionless. The revving of a motor boat engine unsettled Von\'s attention. A go-fast boat had emerged from the port side of the ship.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Von, jump in. This ship is about to sink&quot; cried his partner.<br />\n<br />\nGiles, having been released from Von\'s control, steadied himself and charged at him. &quot;You ain\'t bailing out of this you mutt.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nVon, anticipating Giles\' move, built up a mass of wave around his right hand. Just as Giles was about to pound him Von smashed his fist on the floor. The ricocheted air wave sent Giles flying down the end of the deck. The next thing he knew was that the small boat was speeding towards the shores of Glam District with his target on board.\r\n						</blockquote>\r\n					</div>\r\n\r\n					\r\n				</div>\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="after_content">\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lQgDHe9.png?1" border="0" alt="" /><br />\n<br />\n<div>\r\n    <div class="pre-spoiler">\r\n     <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:80px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onclick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display != \'\') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display = \'\';this.innerText = \'\'; this.value = \'Hide\'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[1].getElementsByTagName(\'div\')[0].style.display = \'none\'; this.value = \'Show\';}">&nbsp;<span style="padding-top: 2px;">Spoiler</span>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div class="spoiler" style="display: none;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/kairi822-1/illusion-is-mine-ling-tosite" target="_blank">https://soundcloud.com/kairi822-1/il...ne-ling-tosite</a></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div><br />\n<br />\n</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n</div></div></blockquote>\r\n				\r\n				\r\n			</div>\r\n			\r\n			<div class="cleardiv"></div>\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n		<div class="postfoot">\r\n			<!-' + '- <div class="postfoot_container"> -' + '->\r\n			<div class="textcontrols floatcontainer">\r\n				<span class="postcontrols">\r\n					<img style="display:none" id="progress_3636970" src="images/misc/progress.gif" alt="" />\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n						<a id="qrwq_3636970" class="newreply" href="newreply.php?do=newreply&amp;p=3636970" rel="nofollow" title="Reply With Quote"><img id="quoteimg_3636970" src="clear.gif" alt="Reply With Quote" />  Reply With Quote</a> \r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n				</span>\r\n				<span class="postlinking">\r\n					\r\n						\r\n					\r\n\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n\r\n					\r\n					\r\n\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n				</span>\r\n			<!-' + '- </div> -' + '->\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div>\r\n	<hr />\r\n</li>\r\n';

							<font color="#333333"><b>TecFas (Technology and Fashion Epicenter) District<br />
</b>Separated into five expansive wards: two are urban residential areas filled with compact apartments, one is a Central Park/Gardens region for public enjoyment, the last two sectors are purely skyscrapers and towers of various corporate and financial businesses as well as grand plazas and broad company court-yards<br />
<b>Notable crime includes</b>: Corporate espionage (bribery, blackmail, aggravated theft), Excessive cyber security compromises that result with financial losses or collapse of physical infrastructure, Heavy drug trafficking through online black market dealings enforced by well-equipped street gangs, frequent super-villain assaults upon property and civilians<br />
<br />
<b>Glam (Glamour and Entertainment) District:<br />
</b>Separated into six modestly sized wards: three of which are upper-class and massive penthouse apartment real-estate sectors that make-up a large part of &quot;Midtown&quot;, two are seaside sectors dedicated to water-front businesses and beaches along with suburban homes, the final ward is a cultural epicenter for the entertainment and film industry (think studio lots and concrete Hollywood) along with public attractions such as museums<br />
<b>Notable crime includes</b>: Organized super-villain crime which has a firm hold on the business industries of the waterside wards, increasing reports of peculiar and psychotic criminals committing murders that are eerily inspired or similar to each other, increasing reports of minor public misconduct, increasing reports of large group suicides most notably among the youth, increasing reports and sightings of wild animals or alleged monsters<br />
<br />
<br />
District Rosters:<br />
<br />
TecFas<br />
<ul><li style="">Joseph (Hero)</li><li style="">Blacklist (Neutral)</li><li style="">Nimbus (Hero)</li><li style="">Zero Kay (Villain)</li></ul><br />
<br />
Glam<br />
<ul><li style="">Silent Knight (Hero)</li><li style="">Fallen Angel (Neutral)</li><li style="">Von (Hero)</li><li style="">Luminary (Hero)</li><li style="">Mana (Neutral)</li><li style="">Emily (Neutral)</li></ul><br />
<br />
<br />
Villains are free to commit themselves to  a single district as their base of operations. Heroes and Neutrals are forced to be stuck in the district the GM assigned. No character is allowed to leave the district until the main plot for the region has been completed, where more districts shall be opened or previous districts will be unlocked for free roaming. There may possibly even be multiple main plot storylines which include traversing between districts.<br />
<br />
The GM (me) shall make the first official post for the RP below. This post will serve as the set-up for the inception of the RP's day/night cycle and current events. Thank you for your patience, the post shall be created soon.<br />
<br />
Edit: The RP has begun! Get in on the action and have some fun.<br />
<br />
Edit two: Schedule has been implemented. Story updates on Thursdays. </font>
