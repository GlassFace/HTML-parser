[Personal Life Discussions] I keep scratching my arms till I bleed
 I always wear long sleeves no mater how hot it is outside (because they look good on me) because my arms are scarred up. Sometime without even thinking I start scratching myself and I can't stop. Like when I'm nervous, angry, sad or when I am having a bad dream I start to scratch my arms and before I realize it blood everywhere. I am asking this because I want to cos play as a anime girl and she wears a sleeveless dress, but she does not have scratched up bloody arms. Any ideas? (P.S I have already tried cut my fingernails to the nub but they cut threw anyway)
