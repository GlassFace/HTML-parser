[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Let's ignore the stupid lengthy unimportant bot post above. Yeah, valvrave is back. Been waiting for this. Now the valvraves are complete. My guess is that the second season will be focusing more on land battles rather than space battles, just as hinted in the opening. And is it just me that feels valvrave unit 2 would be a major badass?
