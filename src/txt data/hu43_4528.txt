 ヾ(●・◇・●)ノ I'm back!! (Meriadie)
 （ﾉ´д｀）I'm so sorry I haven't been on in so long!! I completely forgot about this place! Though, I've found a new interest in this so I'll definitely try and be on more c: Well, lets get on with this introduction! ヾ(*ΦωΦ)ﾉ My name is Taylor but you can call me Lopa! My username on here was previously Meriadie but now its dragonlopa. I am a transboy (ftm) so he/him pronouns please! I already have a girlfriend, and we've been together for a happy year and almost half! So please no trying to flirt or get on me, it makes me very very very uncomfortable (๑◕︵◕๑). But I would like to make friends! I love to talk!! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ Okay!! So on with me! I'm a cosplayer and I go to many cons!! Such as Anime Mid-Atlantic, Nekocon, Omegacon, etc. I am also a photographer, so if you're going to any of these, please tell me so I can give you a personal photoshoot! I also draw, a lot. I've been drawing for a very very long time, and you can see my old art on here too (which is not good, ew, sorry you had to see that,,). But I do commissions and requests for a small sum of $$$ so don't be afraid to ask! Art trades are free!!! ٩(●˙▿˙●)۶ I'm into animes like Blue Exorcist, Puella Magi Magica Madoka, The Devil is a Part Timer, Bleach, Naruto, Black Rock Shooter, Lucky Star, Tokyo Ghoul, Dangan Ronpa, and many others!! I am also into a webcomic called Homestuck! I'm not that fond of SuperWhoLock, Diabolic Lovers, Chobits, or Clannad just because of the things in them and I'm just not fond of them,, ヾ(´▽｀*)ﾉ☆ Ah but I think that's it!!! I hope I can meet a lot of friends on here! Thank you guys for accepting me!
