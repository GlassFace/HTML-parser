 In the Mood for a Space Bandit Type Anime
 So I have really been in the mood for a space bandit type anime. Something like Cowboy or Outlaw where a rag tag crew goes off any does something. Maybe looking for treasure, or bounty hunting or whatever. I would prefer real ships as appose to mechs. Anyone got any recommendations of something I might enjoy?
