 The Food You Eat Most - Page 4
 Ramen. It's CHEAP!

 Probably bread. It's always around, and can be made into breakfast lunch and dinner very quickly (toast, sandwiches and then clubhouse sandwiches or something). PLUS you can put so many different things on it. If I was able to choose though, it'd be sushi. Ah, how I love sushi. Too bad it's so expensive and I've run out of the ingredients to make it. 

 I would say probably soup. Although if I have to break it down it is most likely lentil soup, because I think lentil is delicious and it's full of protein. Second to that is probably chicken noodle soup. 
 I'd have to say NUTELLAAAA:P 
 Ramen noodles for me 
 Bacon sarnie at some point everyday. I'm obsessed with these. 
 Rice.. everyday for lunch, I'd make sure that I have a bowl of rice to eat, then I add a few things with it. Freshly cook fish from a pan, then I like to add vegetables, recently I've been adding green and red peppers, but I like fired onions instead. Then I top it off with soy and sweet and sour duck sauce ^^ mmm-mmm-mm 
 Now that I am mostly a Vegetarian, I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. The fruit I eat are apples, grapes, oranges (favorite), occasionally bananas, strawberries, and occasionally a type of non-strawberry berry like raspberries. If you include tomatoes as a fruit, I eat cherry tomatoes (those are the only ones I can eat by themselves), and I use to eat catalope (sucky spelling, I am half-sleep), but in Oklahoma, Kansas and parts of Arkansas, the local catalope has been affected with a bacteria and has been making some people sick so they took them off the store selves (the disease probably related to the weather). As far as vegetables, I eat carrots, asparagus, lettuce, corn, and salads. I also eat eggs (scrambled) (I am on a Ovo-Vegetarian diet, not a Vegan diet), soy, koos koos, nuts and for dairy since I am not consuming any lactose products, I drink almond milk and use them for a Vegan shake I make. I drink soda only once or twice a week so I usually drink vitamin water, regular water, tea, almond milk, and occasionally a powerade (not much though).

 When at home I eat a lot of pasta and rice because it's cheap and easy to make. At work, I eat a lot of granola because it's quick and easy and filling.

 Well I was brought up on rice and curries, and now then I have moved out I still eat rice and curries.

 Mexican food we eat the most. 
 The most i can narrow it down is any kind of pure, raw meat. So sausages do not count, but chicken, pork chops, beef steak any of this kind of thing.

 Pasta, hot dogs, chimichangas, and LOTS of water and green tea. A box of elbow macaroni costs 89 cents with a jar of pasta sauce being slightly over a dollar, a bag of 8 chimichangas costs $3, a set of 8 hot dogs are 89 cents with the buns being $1. Sometimes I'll buy a cheap pizza or a Banquet dinner. Anyway, that's what my diet consists of, although I am contemplating buying those vegetable stir fry bags for $1.49 each. I get exercise everyday, so maybe those veggie stir fry would be just enough of a push to reach my optimal weight...

 Potatoes and coffee and green beans. I love green beans. <3

 Popcorn. I eat it almost every day. It tastes so good and it's also satiating. I never get sick of eating it, especially the salty one. Now I feel like eating it again hahaha. 

 Meat. A lot of steaks or tacos
