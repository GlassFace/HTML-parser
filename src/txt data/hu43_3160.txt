[Action] Isuca
 Shinichirou decides to look for a job in order to pay his rent, and his teacher suggests that he work for someone at their house doing housekeeping; however, the person who hired him was Sakuya, a girl who is the 37th head of the Shimazu family, and her job is to exorcise and eliminate unwanted creatures. Shinichirou accidentally releases one of the creatures that Sakuya captures and they cooperate to catch it. A story of comedic creature hunting begins! This is starting in the winter, January 2015! Looking forward to it!

 Thanks again Ned!! Something showed up to take over after sao and log horizon

 This sounds interesting. I still feel as if three or four more female characters will be introduced and just ruin the storytelling. 
 I don't think that will happen in this one. Looking at all the manga chapter covers and all, they all seem to be focused on Sakuya. Harems appear to be completely absent.

 This one has finally aired! I was totally looking forward to it! It's a pretty late start to the season, but that is easily explained by the fact that it's only expected to have 10 episodes. Unfortunately. :/

 I'm really impressed with this. Even though it's very ecchi, it has a very interesting setting and story so far. I love Japanese folklore and spirituality. This anime is an interesting blend of action, ecchi, and comedy in a supernatural setting based on traditional Japanese folklore. An unexpected but nice mix! Here are some screencaps from the first episode: PS, I'm told the opening scene with the centipede was anime only, and not present in the manga.

 I was going to watch this anyways, and now I'm even more excited to catch the pilot later today! 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils?

 Sakuya sure is just like a lot of other characters, nothing really unique about her. The MC seems a bit bland, but at least he has unexplained peculiarities. Wow, the ecchii is just shameless here isn't it? At least there aren't tentacles...which is a terrible thing to say because it's implying that the anime has already gone down to such low standards. A KISS OUT OF NOWHERE. I see now why Sakuya was only able to return the bad-ass, blackout-causing lightning beast while earlier she killed the Centipede. That was a lousy ending, not much hook to it. The OP and ED of this anime are really good. My my, the character cast is so under-whelming and predictable. I hope it picks up story-wise, because so far the plot is nothing special, and might get annoying given the short time it has to develop these stock characters.

 Yawn. Extremely rushed, animation is not that great, voice actors are alright, characters are played out, and only 10 episodes? Ill give it one more episode but I'll probably drop this. 

 Erm... Probably no. Tried first ep but the female main is too typical, settings seem alright but not very special imo. Voice casts didn't attract me and story is rushed. Maybe one more ep before deciding drop or not.

 Oh my goodness gracious, the amount of generic ecchii-harem themes just makes things bland. The "imaginary sex gore" in this episode was just weird...who gets off from rats chewing them?! Rat Tornadoes, wut? In all honesty, Tama is a much better and stronger girl compared to Sakuya as of the moment, but I'm not one to take sides in harem shippings. The school and the school-children, for the sake of plot, have no ****ing clue about the monsters - for ****s sake there was a vicious rat colony that has already eaten many, many people just underneath the campus. More girls from the OP being introduced, more soft plot progression. For 10 episodes, it's an uneventful series but I'll still watch it.

 I think this is the first time I've ever wholeheartedly agreed with you.

 This little sister who's so much better than the older one (as per cliche), who's also stoic and blunt, I just can't with her. Wow, after that bath scene she just steals the guy, who was knocked unconscious by the power of vagina? Oh boy, doesn't she just have no dignity for her body. RIP random guy and shotgun bro, you both died for the sake of plot. I actually liked the kiss circumstances, they were so ridiculous that they were good...and that twin-tailed ass. Have fun getting home you slut. The newest enemy, the one with the silly hat, seems a bit bland as of the moment. Why do I commit myself to watching average to decent anime every season....
