 Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
 So a friend of mine is obsessed with Jojo, and kept bugging me to watch it. So considering I have seen the old Jojo's Bizarre Adventure that came out a while ago (And has quite the bad Dub in my opinion, the Sub was great though..) I though hey! I'll start off with Stardust Crusaders, and so far its good! I'm about 9 or so episodes in. Its a bit weird... But I like it! My question is what are your guys opinions on Jojo? And what part do you prefer?
