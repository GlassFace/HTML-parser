 Hunting for Anime Like This
 Hi! I am pretty new to anime and I would really love it if you could recommend some stuff for me. Here's a list of the anime I enjoy: Attack on Titan FMAB FMA SAO Eden of the East Lucky Star Usagi Drop OHSHC If you could recommend anything similar, I would really appreciate it. I generally like fantasy anime but also the occasional light-hearted comedy like Ouron High School Host Club.
