[Adventure] Shinsekai Yori
 Yeah I loved this anime...The suspense was really killing me,but it was worthed. Though I started watching this anime because of the yaoi scene and was really disapointe that it lasted for only one episode. The main character was indecisive from one guy to another and then to a girl and to the same guy again... Annoying. Shin x Satoru 4ever!! 
 Â Spoiler "If the king does not lead, how can he expect his subordinates to follow?"
