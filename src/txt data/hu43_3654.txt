 Re-watching drama/romance anime
 From time to time I re-watch drama/romance/comedy anime that I've watched before. They're usually short, which is annoying but it's good for when I just want to watch something else than what I've been watching at the time. Sometimes I forget them, and it takes a while before I find them again and then I think "ah, that was good I should watch that again" and then I do. Do you often re-watch these sorts of anime? If so, which drama/romance/comedy anime did you last re-watch?
