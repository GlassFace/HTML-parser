 Attack on Titan OVA
 There is going to be a Shingeki no Kyojin ova starting December 9th. Just found out today super excited! Thought I would share just in case other people weren't aware. Have a wonderful day! 

 Wow! An Attack on Titan OVA? I struggle to think of some way that the OVA would be even more awesome than the series, but nothing comes to mind.
