 Bluray & Anime
 Well, that's the thing. The golden rule of Bluray which every production company seems to ignore. If the original quality (quality of the master) is so low that nothing would be gained from a Bluray release, then it's POINTLESS. Casablanca on Bluray?! REALLY?! Gunbuster on Bluray?! REALLY?! Of course, it's all about the mighty dollar, so companies will release these pointless "high quality" special Bluray editions no matter what. Just proves you have to be smart when buying Bluray and not just buy it cause you like the show. I'm not saying I don't like Bluray, I LOVE Bluray! There are many films that just would never looks as brilliant if it wasn't for the format, but Bluray is so advanced that it easily exceeds the quality of most of the media printed on it. What to do? Homework. Personally, anything past 98 I buy on DVD not Bluray. After 98, depends. Netflix helps with that decision alot. I highly suggest you rent the Bluray from Netflix first before you buy it if you're not sure if it would look any better then the DVD you have already, or plan to get.
