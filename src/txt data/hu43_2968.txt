[Adventure] Ai Tenchi Muyo! (Tenchi Muyo! Love)
 Ai Tenchi Muyo! (愛・天地無用！) is a Japanese anime series produced by AIC. The series is based on the Tenchi Muyo! franchise and is sponsored by the city of Takahashi, Okayama in order to promote tourism for the city. It was also created to commemorate the franchise's 20th anniversary. The anime series is set to air on Tokyo MX beginning in October 2014, which will consist of 50 five-minute episodes. The series will be directed by Hiroshi Negishi (who previously directed Tenchi Universe), with Suzuhito Yasuda providing the new, updated character designs. Many of the voice actors from the original franchise are set to return, with the exception of Ayeka, who will now be played by Haruhi Nanao. In this story, the world is in chaos, thanks to Washu. Now in order to save it, Tenchi Masaki must go undercover as a student teacher at an all-girls school. Unfortunately for him, trouble always comes his way. Episodes are 4 minutes long.
