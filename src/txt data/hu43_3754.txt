 I've always wanted to see a continuation of what happened in the novel as an anime form. Things got so much darker and twisted after the events that happened in the anime, and they were so interesting to read about. Looking forward to this.

 This has been on my mind ever since I read about the announcement of the 2nd season in March. Excitment can't even describe how I feel about this. I can however, hold out until an English dub comes out though.

I forgot how fun the show was! Though I did watch it in 2014 for the first time so it was relatively recent. It was great when  Spoiler those kids in the van were saying the celty sightings were like black bullet or death gun in sao!!! Woohoo!!!! Also didn't celty use a  Spoiler phone with a physical keyboard? Now she has a current smartphone it seems. And  Spoiler . Those girls in the apartment are new right?? Are they sisters or just roommates???? This will be fun

Trust me when I say that it is difficult to not watch the new season currently, but my preference for English dubs is also pretty strong.

 So happy this is finally here after 5 years. The first ep was pretty good. I like shinrah's father and his new mother in law. I might need to rewatch season 1, it's been so long thatI forgot so much about the characters 
 lolololololol
