[Mystery] Psycho-Pass
 plot In the near future, it is possible to instantaneously measure a person's mental state, personality, and the probability that a person will commit crimes with technology called the Dominator. Just thinking about a crime can make you guilty, and in this world there is no mercy for criminals. Detectives work in pairs--one Enforcer and one Inspector--with Enforcers delivering lethal justice, and Inspectors making sure their partners don't take things too far. The story follows Enforcer Shinya Kōgami, who must solve and manage crimes in this dark future. Psycho pass is a new anime this season, It has top tier animation and has a very nice plot. Trailer

 I love this anime so much, I just watched episode 1, its probably my favourite anime this season. Although there is a good amount of hype about the anime K. I prefer Psycho Pass, for now I'm only judging on the first episode of both series.

 Here I thought we had awesome gadgets in our world, but their badass toys definately puts our to shame. I should pre-order one of those. 
 Looks very promising, gonna watch ep1 in just a few. 
 "Create your dream, live your dream, be your dream"
 Not really sold yet, and Urobuchi has a problem with infodumping heavily in the first episode of a series, but I'll keep going with it. 

 First episode was great. Definately one of my favorites this season. Great animation, story got me hooked, and i loved the overall dark feel of it.

 Lol Ian, I didnt even know that Gen Urobuchi was making this, I just found out. I like most of the things he creates. I will look forward to more episodes.

 Watched the first episode, it was amazing 5/5 !! :3

The concept is interesting. Lastly the newbie girl we'll be following around ups the watchable value of this anime for me, she's cute.

 Wah, Episode 2 is out guys, its not as fast paced but its still very good! It seems like the system is kind of troublesome. I also like the OP and End. 8.5/10 for this episode.

 I know, I was rating the episode not the series. But like you said the concept is good so hopefully the series lives up to everyone's expectations :3 

 I'm liking this... So, if you were in this world do you think your psycho-pass would be cloudy or clear? Would you be treated as a latent criminal or not?

 I enjoy this, I'm curious to see how Kana Hanezawa will manage, and try not be "moe".

 I only just started watching the episode. "Dogs are dogs. Owners are owners. A relationship where you only stick to your own kind, I think is best for you." If somebody gave that kind of advice, it would only prompt me to seek a deeper relationship. There is no-one in my life whom I care about more or have a better relationship with than my dog. *EDIT: Okay, just finished Episode 4. You're right... wow, that was a great episode! I can't wait until the next one now!

 Enjoying this series a lot, THURSDAY ANIME IS BACK! I like how we are going into an arc now, and not these one minute Scooby-Doo mysteries. I still can't grasp how the director wanted to make it not moe or overall just ban the term when you have Kana Hanazawa as the female lead. It even looks just like her.

 I just saw the first episode, IT WAS AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGAAAA. If you have the opportunity to then watch it. 
 I've been out of watching anime for a bit now, but this one has definitely caught my eye. I'll be watching this when we let out for the week of Thanksgiving. 
 Episode 6 is out! Dang, this episode was actually pretty scary. I actually got a little shock after watching it. Another great episode!

 Me too! This one made the hairs stand up a bit on the back of my neck. I'm really feeling this show, and it's starting to become one of my favorites ever. I just love this sort of thing... maybe because my Psycho-Pass is so cloudy? Keh keh keh.

 This anime is probs one of my favourites. I've seen 2 episodes already but I've decided I'm going to wait for them all to be done and then watch a marathon. I tend to do that with anime that I LOVEVEVEEVEVEVEVEVVEE. 
 Episode 7 out! Dont have much to say quite passive episode. Q.Q But dang.. that girl is so scary.
