[Personal Life Discussions] Why are you Single?
 i'm single because four months ago my girlfriend decided that she'd rather be in the air force than be with me. i was madly, madly in love with her. she wanted to stay friends but i just became bitter and pushed her away. i still think about our relationship often, it was the best time of my life, and ever since then i've been searching for something to fill the void in my heart.
