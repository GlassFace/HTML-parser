[Event] Anime Review Competition
 I was initially worried that our comments would spark some emotional responses, but you've all acted mature and shown great sportsmanship (with the exception of the victor xD) so props for that. Also, thanks to Archangel for setting the event up in the place! I wouldn't had bothered with it if someone didn't take the first step.
