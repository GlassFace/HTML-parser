[Anime] Favorite Anime Christmas Episode
 It's the holiday season, so I thought this would be a good topic. Like many a sitcom, or TV show on television, anime too, has had their fair share of Christmas episodes. What is your favorite moment or episode of any anime series? OK, as for me, I like the Christmas episode or segment of To Love Ru, where there are these 3 sisters from an alien planet, at a Christmas party, in a mostly Buddhist country! I want to watch the Xmas episode of Ah! My Buddha soon, here are 6 sexy teen girls training to be nuns, in a Buddhist temple, with a teen guy and his grandma, and they have a Xmas episode? Don't you just love anime!
