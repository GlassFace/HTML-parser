 "Journey" Anime, similar to Samurai Champloo?
 There were many things that made me love Samurai Champloo. One thing was the amazing soundtrack, done in part by my favourite musical artist, Nujabes. Then I really liked the art style. The "chanpuru" of Hip Hop subculture and feudal Japan was interesting. The characters were well put together, the animation and action looked beautiful. What I am going at here, though, is the atmosphere and journey of the show. It was a trip through Japan. It made me feel like I was on a journey with the characters and the feeling it gave off was very "romantic" to me. By romantic I mean the spirit of travelling, the attraction of the unknown, the search for something. Seeing different villages, eating different food, going to a traditional theatre, looking for a place to stay for the night... What I am looking for is an anime that captures that feeling. It does not even have to have a plot; I'm simply looking for an anime about travels, a journey, trying culinary specialties. Something that has this atmosphere. The setting doesn't matter and it can also be artsy, like Mononoke. It may also be fantasy, adventure... It should just have that atmosphere. Does anyone know something of the sorts? I already watched Cowboy Bebop (which I thoroughly enjoyed), so you don't need to recommend that. Thanks in advance. Yours truthfully, The Kinky Priest.
