 infinite stratos custom armor
 for a lot of shows i like to make a character of myself and infinite stratos was no different. i was wondering if anyone else out there had put any thought into what their IS would be like. i'll start with my own My Character is named Meric and is a transfer student from America (see what i did there?) IS Name: EagleStar Appearance: blue with red and white highlights and stars on the shoulders Weapons: two high caliber revolvers and a 3 cylinder revolving rocket launcher Special: since it's named Eaglestar it needs to use its talons, so they function like a smaller version of Ichika's sword. just for aesthetics the engines are shaped like wings
