[General Discussion] Body Modification - Page 2
 I'd like to discuss this, but at the same time have everyone be civil about the discussion. Mission Impossible - I know. But try. I think many people have an opinion on body modifications. Whether it is plastic surgery, tattoos, piercings, or the down right bizarre mods, most of us have some ourselves, know someone who does, or has a personal opinion on it. I'd like to know if you have any or what you think of them. Also, keep in mind I am referring to body modification in the sense that it does not necessarily improve/restore ones appearance or health (i.e. reconstructive plastic surgery). Go ahead now.
