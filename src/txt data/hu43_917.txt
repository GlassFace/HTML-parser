[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 It's been quite some time since I've watched any anime. The last "recent" anime I had watched was 00 Gundam: Season 2 nearly 4 years ago. After many recommendations to start watching Valvrave, I finally gave in and started giving it a go. I'm definitely a huge fan of the artwork thus far. Both Katsura Hoshino and Yun Koga have very similar art styles and I get quite the 00 Gundam vibe from watching Valvrave. I definitely dig the Mecha designs, but ultimately, I still prefer the iconic Gundam designs. Not going to lie, but Episode 2 looked like a very stylized Musha Gundam fighting a very stylized Qubeley crossed with a Zeong. Valvrave vs Dorsia Ideal Mecha Musha Gundam Qubeley Zeong Definitely got to say though, I didn't particularly miss the cheese that the Japanese tend to gravitate to. The first episode was horribly predictable and very Gundam-esque. I partway almost expected the first episode to mirror Gundam Seed (given the nature of how things unfolded) but I'm extremely glad it didn't turn out that way 100%... although, not particularly fond of this... Vampire thing going on. At the very least, I'm intrigued. Will definitely keep going.
