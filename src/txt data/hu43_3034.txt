 The Last: Naruto the last movie.
 The Last: Naruto the last movie. The following text is from the Tokyo Otaku Mode website, telling us of the last Naruto film.  Spoiler Under such circumstances, the fans are focusing their attention on The Last: Naruto the Movie, which is scheduled to release on Dec. 6. They have a good reason for doing so: Besides general supervision of character design and story, the original author Masashi Kishimoto is working on an original story just for the film. In other words, a story that takes place after the mangas finale. Much-anticipated details regarding the movie were announced just recently: The poster visual was released, and part of the plot was also revealed. First of all, the poster shows a mature, grown-up Naruto standing, with older versions of Kakashi, Sasuke, Hinata, Sakura, and Shikamaru drawn on the side. Naruto also has a long scarf tied around his neck, which is holding the key to the movies plot. Another unusual part is Hinata, who, unlike all the others who are facing forward, is the only one shown from the side, looking listless. This seems like a hint foreshadowing a development from the original story. Moreover, the slogan Last story, first love also has a deep meaning, sketching the lines of a spectacular drama. The story itself starts from the countdown to the last day of Earth. The moon is getting abnormally close, and at this rate, its going to collapse and cover the Earth in a meteorite shower. Whether Naruto and the others able to overcome the danger they are facing will most probably be the biggest highlight of the movie. Personally I don't like the new Naruto design, though I can't wait for this film. It also shows a glimpse of an older Sasuke which gives us an idea that Sasuke doesn't die in the latest manga.. Anyway what are your thoughts on this? Oh I didn't know whether this should of been posted in General Discussions or here. This section seemed appropriate.
