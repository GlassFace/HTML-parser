 pls tell me the name of this anime
 I apologize beforehand but this will be a vague desciption as i dont remember much about this anime. just that i liked it alot and i wanted to finish it.all i remember is its about this Boy who could see like ghosts or something. and i remember that the ghosts were always in a Parade.....i think thats the most certain thing i remember. like the ghosts were in something called a death parade or something like that.....and the boy was like ascending to be the next like king or whatever at the place where they were. i know this is a terrible description and i vaguely remember the anime. the parade of ghosts though i remember better than anything.
