 My Top 5 Recomendations
 Here's my top 5 best anime (My opinion, It's not exactly based on how popular, but how good it is, and how they tell the story, oh yea, and the characters! <3) 5. Tales of the Abyss - About a 18 year old boy who cant leave him home, but then is forced to. (kind of hard to explain)) 4. Durarara - About the 15 yr old guy who moves to Ikebukuro, and has to survive the drastic changes and the mysteries. 3. Fairy Tail - About the girl named Lucy who is a wizard and joins a guild, now she has to deal with the quest, danger, drama, etc 2. Soul Eater And finally #1: Â Spoiler 1. K-Project - The reason why this is my top favorite is probably because of the characters. They are so unique, even the perfect characters have something wrong with them. My favorite is Fushimi, he is my avatar ^^ 
There are no such things as good and bad, or heroes. There will always be evil. And that will be me.
