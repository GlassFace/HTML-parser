 North Korea says Seth Rogen's new movie is an 'act of war'
 The government of North Korea today issued an unsurprisingly harsh statement about Seth Rogen's upcoming film, The Interview, denouncing the action-comedy as an "act of war." In the movie, Rogen and James Franco star as two journalists who, after scoring an interview with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, are ordered by the CIA to assassinate him. "There is a special irony in this story line as it shows the desperation of the US government and American society," Kim said. "A film about the assassination of a foreign leader mirrors what the US has done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine," he added. "And let us not forget who killed [President John F.] Kennedy – Americans. In fact, President [Barack] Obama should be careful in case the US military wants to kill him as well." link The Obama one nearly killed me. But yeah NK isn't ever likely to do anything to harm anyone which makes this even funnier.

 His father was way cooler about this sort of thing. Kim Jong-il never declared Team America an act of war. Tyrannical kids these days. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 I only care that he might be crazy enough to do something. Otherwise, don't care. I do think it's foolish to underestimate NK's hatred of us, their willingness to die fighting us, their opinion of their own power, etc. We might want/need to overthrow NK sometime within this decade. I'd rather we strike first. I mean, how many threats do we really want to brush off? 
 Kim Jong Un's face is an act of war. 
 8/21/13 Never Forget 
 We brush his threats off mainly because he is a joke. He may impotently fire a few missles, obama will draw a line in the sand, and then say he never did, and that will be the end. If I seriously thought he was a threat to anyone, I might be worried ( especially since my cousin is in S Korea now, army)but he isn't so I am not. Though not a fan of the unfunny seth guy, so if this maybe stops him from making more bad movies, then at least something good might come out of tha bag of crazy.

 This just in, North Korea says stupid **** again. A new study shows that grass is green, and that the sky is blue. 
 When I finally got it figured out, I've changed the whole damn plan. "Memorize this! Memorize Jeremiah Gottwald! Commit it to memory, because that's the memorable name of the man who has defeated you."

I'm laughing at all the people taking this **** seriously. North Korea has no allies who would do anything for it. Its top priority is maintaining the status quo at home and therefore would not benefit from, you know, starting a war with the most militarily powerful nation on earth. Kim Jong Un may be oblivious, but the people who actually run North Korea aren't.

Kim Jong Un may be oblivious, but the people who actually run North Korea aren't. You can't believe everything you heard. We really don't know what North Korea could do to us. I seriously doubt even our military intelligence knows entirely. Laughing at threats from a country who has nukes... hm, keep laughing, might not be so funny if they blow yo ass up. The thing is, I don't know if we are willing to nuke them while they fling nukes at us. We're more of a slide our way in, kill your leaders, free the people kind of country. You guys honestly don't worry that NK could get through and hurt us to some degree? Again not talking about winning the war... I'm talking about just the troubles of being attacked by nuclear weapons.

I'm talking about just the troubles of being attacked by nuclear weapons. North Korea has been making threats to surrounding countries and the West since the 1950's. In the past three years it has made nuclear threats on dozens of occasions. It is simply to create a sense of crisis in the region and scare away foreign investors in addition to increasing a feeling of unification among the North Korean people. I'm not talking about winning the war or anyone getting blown up. I'm saying there won't be a war because it's absolutely impossible for North Korea to fight a war and anybody who makes real decisions in North Korea knows this. Even if they were able to successfully launch an armed missile at a surrounding country, it would more likely than not be intercepted and the regime would collapse within a month from the subsequent backlash. It's really the same every time and I can't believe anybody believes them anymore. Their threats must be taken seriously by surrounding nations because people like you who actually buy into them exist, but every single time the threats just fall short of war. It's the most familiar script in East Asia at this point and it's mind numbing to think that people still insist on losing their **** every time it happens. 
 Pu$$ies are mad cause they have small pingases. No seriously though. they can f**k themselves. How long have they threatened the US? A hell of a long time, have they every actually done anything? **** no they haven't. I doubt NK is as big of a threat as they say they are. They think we are such terrible people, however they kill their own civvies just because they didn't pray to the "great leader" often enough. They worship their leader like dumba$$es. However they do what they have to do to survive. Kim Jong fcuk-tard needs to kill himself. Why did the chicken cross the road? To avoid North Korea's long range missiles. You know how bad it is being the only fat kid in school? Imagine being the only fat kid in your country 
 your heart looks delicious she says licking her lips as her kamikaze fists crash into floating ribs I stare at you the way you stare at your mirror so please show me no mercy don't be a soft assassin I scream though I'm laughing inside I know you can't destroy me but you're adorable when you try

INB4 Your post triggers nuclear attacks from North Korea, one or two get through, leveling several US cities, as we fight back, China decides its time to take us over, which leads to WWIII, which creates a Fallout 4 kind of world. ;] :3 You heard it here first. Get in your vaults, I'll see you out in the wastelands. :]

 Just like always, North Korea is saying stupid things that it will never act on. Even if it did manage to nuke US cities, they would not be prepared for the military power of the US. We also have nukes, which can easily level that tiny country. 
 HONK :O) 
 You know when the dad made threats, people at least listened, if the little dictator knew what the world thought of him, he would be pissed. If the US actually thought he was capable of doing something,We prob. would have taken action by now. I almost feel like setting up a pool on when KK, attacks us, I would clean up, I will offer great odds.

 No one should be worried about a war starting over a Seth Rogen movie . . . well . . . a war with North Korea at least. That does not mean people should not be concerned about a war starting in the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang has spurned China a bit under Kim Jong-Un and so they are feeling more isolated than usual. At the same time the leadership transition introduces an element of instability. Such events could prompt an escalation of tensions along the border that get out of control.

Kim Jong Un may be oblivious, but the people who actually run North Korea aren't. I thought its allies included China and Russia? Meh, perhaps they disbanded from all the **** Korea says... All questions aside... Q:What has more power than a North Korean nuke? A:A Toyota Prius! Also, i am out fishing right now, and this thread caught my attention. However, as im reading this thread, something hooked on. But because of my slow reaction with a combination of putting my phone away, my line snapped... I BLAME NORTH KOREA FOR MAKING ME LOSE MY FISH :L

 This sounds like an awesome viral campaign/CIA plot. The producers of the movie use their marketing budget to bribe NK into making asinine claims in international media, making people aware that there is yet another movie out starring Seth Rogan and James ****ing Franco. And then when it comes to the cash payment on some secret skull shaped Island, Rogan/Franco give Un Kim Jr poisoned tequila whilst drinking some themselves lest they arose suspicion and hoping they can take the antidose in time. Done right, thats 3 birds, one stone. Also.... And let us not forget who killed [President John F.] Kennedy  Americans. Preach brother, preach.

I said they have no allies who would help them. Why would China commit economic suicide to help its autistic redheaded stepchild? They're not even sure it's worth being their ally for the buffer zone it provides between Western-influenced SK and China. China obviously doesn't want NK to collapse, but again, they're not going to go out of their way to protect it against America. China = Tywin Lannister NK = the Mad King USA = Robert Baratheon

Saying china is like tywin is a compliment because it would mean they are better politically strategically. Am I the only one who actually wants to see something happen. Idk I think it would be entertaining.

Who the hell wants to help North Korea? They don't even listen to their allies. They destabilize the region. Their country has terribly undeveloped infrastructure and their people, while mostly literate and educated, are in the 1970's in technological knowledge. There's very little to get out of helping North Korea. Sure, Russia wouldn't like to see North Korea fall most likely, but they're not going to go to war with the West to bail them out.
