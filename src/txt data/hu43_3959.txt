 Suggestion (not sure if this is the right place)
 Heya Shannon, Thank you for the appreciation or at least considering, this idea... I know I'm not active around here (mostly because I'm a busy person, it's not that I don't want to actually be part...) but at least for a newbie as me, who gets easily overwhelmed with the ridiculous amount of good things to watch (not to mention some of the older series are over 70,80,100 episodes) having some directions would be nice I loved KlK, for real <3 It was the second anime I completed after AoT and well, let's just say I found some great reasons (and company) to start watching older shows All thanks to A4!!! And I didnt know I liked Anime xD Silly me xD Kuruma
