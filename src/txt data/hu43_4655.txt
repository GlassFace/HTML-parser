Otherwise there's Higurashi no Naka Koro ni, Boogiepop Phantom (kinda old some don't like it one of my favs ), and Shiki. Enjoy! Thanks for all the welcome backs everyone I kinda lost control of the thread lol! And my username is awesome, that's not nice. Sorry I don't know Japanese to the person who spoke Japanese. If I missed a question or something feel free to talk to me on my profile or whatever it is these days lol.
