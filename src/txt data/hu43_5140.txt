 Guide to Anime for Beginners and even Experts!
 i apologize if this has already been discussed but what is an OVA is it just a alternate rendition of the original anime or is it something completely different. And why do all anime's even those u think are directed towards kids have such adult overtones (murder, sex, drugs, profanity) is just a culturaly difference or is all anime targeted towards adults.
