[Anime] Super milk chan show anyone?
 I remember seeing the first season DVD available for sale many years back. I had no idea what it was, but it looked intriguing so I bought into it. After watching it, I knew I liked it. It had its wit, humor, and some biting satire. They were even able to adjust some of the jokes and humor from the original Japanese and put it in terms Americans could understand. I was never able to get the last season on DVD, though and it goes for a pretty penny online now. I do have the rest of the seasons so that is something. So yes, I have heard of it.
