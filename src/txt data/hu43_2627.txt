 Question about Fullmetal Alchemist
 So recently I've started watching fullmetal alchemist brotherhood, I'm already on episode 35 (I think it was 35), had to stop because of exams but I'm going to go back viewing the entire anime My question is, should I have watched the original before? And should I watch it after or is it not worth it?
