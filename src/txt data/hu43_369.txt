In large part because everyone has shitty personalities and motivations. In that respect, this might be one of the more realistic anime out there.

 It's been over ten years since I've last watched the show, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't like it. I still feel giddy when I hear the opening song, hehe. ^^ I've yet to watch You Cannot Redo, so I cannot comment on that. This show has always seemed to be a very divisive one. The plot is a bit convoluted and grandiose, and the show can take itself far too seriously. I think people connect with it thematically. Although I watched it when I was young, I was able to understand it. I feel like if I went back and watched it again, one of two things would happen: I would either appreciate it more, or I would see it as an overblown work of self-indulgence. Idk, maybe I should find out ^__^

 I sincerely doubt most people actually understand what's going on in EVA. What sets these events in motion, what's causing them to happen, etc. There's a lot of story behind the events that take place in both the show, EoE, and Rebuild that they never bother to mention. When they do give little tidbits, I think that most of it flies past people's heads at a million miles per hour too.

How disgusting. I'll ask you the same question: What is the root cause of the conflict in the show and Rebuild? Use the same tags for this one.

I'll wait until Rebuild is finished to form an overall opinion. Also, I didn't mean the translation. I meant, what was disgusting her and why lol Also, I have no idea why she's disgusted. Right now, I'd say she's disgusted because Shinji's tears reminded her of the hospital scene. Also, her powerlessness against Shinji who has had power to do his will unto her now, and previously.

There's no opinion to be formed about factual information pertaining to the show... There is a concrete root cause in both the show and the movies. They're the same, and they're not changing. You can answer this right now.

 ever since i saw a trailer for neon genesis evangelion with the theme song and all that i was inlove with it it is one of my favourite animes and i like the whole monster of the week thing. i haven't seen any of the movies except you are (not) alone if that is a movie. also i maybe might have understood a little bit of it but as a whole anime it was kinda confusing especially the last few episode where it would show a small scene then switch to a black background with Japanese writing my dvd didn't translate that so i was lost with the whole thing and what i don't understand is how this came to be  Spoiler was it in one of the manga or was this created by the magic of the internet 
 So many questions so little time !!!! about the warui i'm not sure maybe it's a sign from her depression Shinji strangled Asuka because she refused to love him because she herself isn't loved, and on the beach he didn't want to get hurt again so he strangled her again but at the last moment she showed one sign of affection and cried because he killed the one person that truly loved him (other than his mom and ,before the death of his mom, his dad) and she said how disgusting because she's didn't like being cried on. And the entire series ... come on everyone, if you people stopped complianing about the series and the characters and learn to understand this series from a depressed angle you will undestand

 I like to think about NGE from the viewpoint I heard of 'Anno hates Eva and you for liking Eva'. Basically, the theory goes, Anno was disgusted with the general fandom for anime and how it liked the same type of thing over and over, and especially the types of ladeh characters it liked- ladies created to suit the viewer and not be their own people. So he made an anime that looked like the typical robots fighting aliens anime, and then filled it with ladies made to actually turn off viewers- Misato and her drinking and emotional problems, Rei being nothing but a doll- as if to say 'hi, you like your ladies like your body pillows: without a mind of their own, riiiiight?', and Asuka being so stand-offish that you couldn't please her. Then he just let the plot spiral down in depression mimicing his own, as a sort of strange statement on how the fandom had played a part with his disillusionment with the industry. But there was one problem that bugs him to the day: People liked it. So he made a movie to satisfy their burning curiousity about the true end, and tried to make it worse. But people loved trying to figure out what it all meant. And still they wanted more. So he took on an attitude of 'If they want this than I'll give it to them!'. And that's why Rebuild is being made. He'll probably make the end even worse. I dunno. Keep rocking on, Anno. 

 I got into this series from hearing about all the issues they had when making it. The "train wreck" that happens due to costs to make it and lack of a budget, to running out of money near the end of the series had me so curious to watch it. It's not for everyone, for sure but I loved everyone bit of it. Was the ending bad? yes, but for me it got me more involved to scour the internet to get others impressions on the series. When the movies came out, I thought they added a breath of fresh air to a series that many may have thrown along the wayside by watching the original. NGE definitely has a cult following like many others of it's ilk and it's well deserved for what it has done. Hell you even see inspiration from this series in the latest summer hit Pacific Rim! -Rei Forever!

 The ending isn't bad, i loved the idea that shinji finally gave over that teen emo phase

 I loved the movie, the ending was way out there and almost impossible to comprehend, but it was still really good

 I don't hate it, it's just like any other super popular series that refuses to die. But whereas I can watch other stuff that ended a bazillion years ago like Rurouni Kenshin or the GTO manga without issue, NGE is pretty boring. Kinda found all the flashy showings in the opening song and that religious stuff pretentious, and even disregarding the movies the merchandise it sells is insane. It's not a terrible anime like other cash cows (Bleach and Naruto, the influx of Yugioh sequels). Still I never got into it, rewatching it is a chore. Light-years beyond Pokemon and the other crap from the 90's that still won't die, but yeah never adored it like other ppl.

They use religious symbolism, but they mean nothing by it. Seriously, the writers said so themselves.

 I remember watching this anime back in my high school's anime club. What fond memories it brings back.

I know it's not significant, it just seems like they threw it in as a bit of a gimmick for that reason. Whereas the anime in your location (Requiem) does put a good effort into making its reference to Phantom of the Opera significant. Ein/Elen and Reiji lost their normal lives and were subject to a hypnotic master's will, essentially being nobodies who had nothing to live for and killed behind a mask or be killed.
