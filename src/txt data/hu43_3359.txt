 A4 Has a New Owner! - Page 3
 Anime-Forums has a new owner by the name of nekoluna. I started Anime-Forums back in 2002. I had built sites and communities before that time but none with the success that Anime-Forums had. I learned A LOT about community management, development work and server management. This was a huge part of who I am now and these skills still serve me well today. In 2006, I started another site designed for computer technicians. Eventually the income the other site made allowed me to quit my "day job" and run sites full time. Unfortunately, any time I had was mostly spent on the other site that was paying the bills. At this point the place was mostly run by its amazing staff and I only really stepped in for server issues/software updates. The new owner is "Building out sites", so I don't know what he has planned but I am sure the attention of a new dev/admin will be a positive move for the forums. I have made some amazing friends here, some have come and gone from the forums, others are still here. I really can't thank the current and past admin and moderator staff, they really kept this place running over the years. So I thank you. And thank you to our members both past and current, because without them there wouldn't be a community. Thats it for me though, I'll drop in every now and then to see what changes have been made, but I don't expect to login much. Please stick around though, I expect some exciting changes in the near future as Nekoluna also hones his craft. 
Owner and Admin of A4, Feel free to message me but PLEASE make sure your question isnt already answered in the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) Forum located HERE.
