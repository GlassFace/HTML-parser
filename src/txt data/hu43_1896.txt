 Talking about bad classics
 M.D. Geist is the best stupid anime ever. It's stupid because it was made by people who simply put in everything they thought was cool in it, and the animators got really pissed about this and basically sabotaged the look of the show, adding to the badness. But it's hilarious and a must-watch for anyone who's curious about bad anime of back then. There are certainly equally stupid titles nowadays, but...those are totally skippable compared to the likes of Geist. Even as stupid as it is, I don't regret watching it at all. That said, the OVA does have nice mecha designs and two great theme songs, so there's that.
