 Why haven't you clicked here yet Senpai? <3
 Hello mina-san, This is my first time posting here so I'm hoping I'll get some good suggestions. I just started Naruto and I'm roughly half way through, I'm looking for a change of pace because the show is so "mindless" for want of a better word, don't get me wrong I'm enjoying it, but up until episode 80-90 nothing interesting happened. I'm just looking for something a little less generic and with more depth to the plot/characters. Only suggest completed series please, no OVA's or movies and max. 50 episodes. The genre doesn't really matter as long as it's not Yaoi, I also enjoy psychological but I can't stand detective orientated anime. Check my list to make sure I haven't seen it before you suggest it-------> http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Murt
