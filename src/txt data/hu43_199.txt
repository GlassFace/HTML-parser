 the newest kpop groups and songs!
 I think YG pays as much attention to Se7en as his other artists, he has been going all the way for Se7en's debut in the US while having to take care of 2NE1 and BB. Se7en didn't do well in the US and that's why he's been off the kpop scene. Nice picks of songs though I don't like BB's lollipop 2, I would've posted 'Tell me goodbye' instead. And songs that really impressed me are: SHINee's Lucifer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dww9UjJ4Dt8 Looking back 2 years ago, I would say this is a hardcore concept for SHINee. G.NA, a new vocalist and her debut song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acFnxra73RM :3
