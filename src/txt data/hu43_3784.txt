[Action] Durarara!!×2
 A half a year after the events of the first season, Ikebukuro has begun to return to normal. High school is in session, Izaya is back to scheming, and Celty, the legendary headless rider, is still chased by the police as she rides through the town. But a few unusual things have slipped into the mix. Gradually, thanks to outside elements, Ikebukuro will be thrown back into chaos. Season two will be split into three arcs. Shou Ten Ketsu Each arc is roughly Eight episodes and I believe it was stated that Ten will begin in the summer and Ketsu will begin Winter of 2016. 

 Episode 1 has aired...Celty...<3 

 Yay, one of my fave series along with Baccano (if you notice my DRRR inspired Shinobu avatar). Well, I am just glad seeing the characters again. I really enjoy how they made tons of anime reference this time.

They even bought a spice and wolf cutout in the first season

 Izaya is like always just awesome! Mikado is walking around with annoying Anri and sulking because Masaomi runaway with creepy Izayas follower Saki....Poor Celty lost her paycheck...

 Those twins are out of control. 
 Mairu and Kuru are ****ing awesome!!!!!!!!!!!! I loved Mairus introduction '' My favorite books are ecyclopedias,magas, and porn!And I swing both ways when it comes to love and sex drive'' hehehe. They are truly Izayas sisters.

 Yes this was good indeed. The new characters are being worked in very well so far.

 "News 666" huh, uh oh. These murders remind me of the videogame Hotline Miami. I loved spotting these short anime references and hearing the Otaku banter. That Celty x Shinra shipping, I'm all for it, a long life to that couple. The "Dollars" are still operating? I always root for Celty to haul her fine ass away from that bike-cop, but the chase scenes are so thrilling to watch. Ah, that first episode was a really nice blast to the past. 
 That fight scene at the park had some creepy people. Celty and Shinra are a nice couple if I do say so myself. All these kouhais have a nice flair to them. Creepy tall man returns, and Shinra's dad is just everywhere doing backroom god-knows-what. Dude, this kid got lucky with the twins! Score. Hey look, her money was there all along...and it fell into the hands of Ecchii Girl and Sports Oppai. Shizuo that was hyper overkill! I gasped out loud when the Russian sushi restaurant was mentioned by the dying tall man. Shinra seems to be in a bit of a gangster pickle. Oh man I love how the story blends all these events and progression into an entertaining series of not exactly chronological events. 
 So the Tall man was attacked by Shizuo and was talking to Shinras father. Meanwhile we have the twins being "bullied" and kissing Kuronuma. I like him I think he has the potential to be an awesome character, he's here to replace Masaomi in my opinion. The twins def gave Celty a run for her money...no pun intended...in the moe factor for this episode...but the moment with the black fog Heart...done. 

 Guys can we drop this please? Posts removed. Since this is NIJ and the other was General Anime. I am letting this thread stay. It's a new season. No lives lost. Carry on.

 *thumbs up* Sounds good :3 Looking forward to watching the new episode when I'm done work. 
 Awww!! I'm loving Durarara! I can't wait for more!!! Aoba seems fake somehow! Gives the same fake goody vibe as Izaya...

 That's a victory, Sora. lol Is the Russian Mafia going to be a part of the plot this season? 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils?

 <----- one of the losers waiting for the dub. I can't get use to the Japanese voices. lol 

 I love how the twins are playing a role in this series, they're hilarious. Also glad to see more of celty and shinrah. It's been a long time but I remember izaya wanting to start a war at the end of last season and it's something that I don't want but need to see ps thanks Shannon. Taka, get over it, your ruining this thread. 
 I really like this but for some reason I feel like I need to take notes to follow along! Anyway the sisters are great!!! Yuri!!!!! I love the figurine chat. They're 3d! No 2.5d I didn't realize we were up to number three already. This is very fluid. It took me awhile to realize the guy who helped the idol was the actor brother. I've seen too many other shows since last weeks episode to keep all the bit characters in line. Definitely looking forward to more. Is this a twenty four show season like the first one?
