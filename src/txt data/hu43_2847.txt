[Anime] Need a new Anime! :D
 Hey, so i just recently finished Madoka Magica and Black Butler (still need to watch the book of circus, i think it's called that and the Movies for Madoka Magica) and could anyone suggest an Anime in those sort of genres? (Fantasy, Horror etc) NOT NARUTO ETC... ありがとう (Arigato! Sorry if i spelled it wrong xD)
