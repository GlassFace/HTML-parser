 A4 Major Updates - February 23rd, 2010
 As you may have noticed, A4 was down for maintenance for about 24 hours. This was a major update bringing along a lot of new functionality. Right now the majority of the new features are switched off but we will be rolling them out over the next week or so. As for the design, it is a little different to the old one and there are still some bugs or graphics that don't match but these will disappear over the coming days. Thank you for your patience during this downtime. 
Owner and Admin of A4, Feel free to message me but PLEASE make sure your question isnt already answered in the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) Forum located HERE.
