[Personal Life Discussions] First thing you would save in a Fire
 I can't help but feel I wouldn't save anything from a fire. I'd be more mad about the fire and would be trying to put it out than worrying about getting anything out. But if I'm forced to choose.. I'd say my family. Cause it would kind of suck to lose the rest of my family in a fire and then be all alone. Unless I'm gonna turn into the caped Fireman. Fire insurance salesman by day, pyromaniac ass kicker by night. Wouldn't be so bad if I had a jetpack made out of fire extinguishers. Otherwise I'd grab my wallet or maybe some valuables, since I'll need it to pay for a motel, or gas... or food for the next few days.. Cause my house just burnt down.
