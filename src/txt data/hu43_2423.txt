 Kamigami no Asobi
 Kamigami no Asobi Summary: The story revolves around Kusanagi Yui, who is ordered by Zeus, a god and the headmaster of a school he created, to teach the meaning of love to young and handsome gods. The reason he has for doing this is to cancel the negative effects of the weakening bond between the world of the divine and the world of the humans. --- Episode 1 Reaction: So far, I have laughed at this anime through the first episode. There are so many tropes, I don't know where to start. Hopefully it gets better...? 
 Overall I decided to pass on this and reading your reaction...it seems like it was for good reason. Someone has to convince me 
 I cannot stop watching it for some reason...like it is clearly geared towards women, but it has been giving me some laughs. 

 Dropped that after watching the first episode, it's kind of childish and stupid in its own way.
