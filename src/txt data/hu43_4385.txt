[Anime] Stuff non anime watchers find weird even though its now just second nature to us.
 I read a manga once where these popular girls were cutting open their stomachs to expose their intestines because, it was the cool thing to do and they were all trying to force one girl to do it to be like them and it was one of the most interesting messed up things I've seen in a long time. Shouldn't this be stuff even anime fans find weird though? Because, non anime fans find simple things like lolis and ecchi scenes weird. If a fan who is usually used to something finds a scene in anime or manga odd, it must be pretty odd.
