[General Discussion] Which hair styles have you regretted wearing?
 IÂ´d probably say that I regret being born with hair at all.... I always get nicknames due to my hair and I hate taking care of it... I did cut my hair really short once and I loved it, however I got a weird mushroom-like haircut when it started growing out again (T_T) Not sexy at all...
