[Site] What Youtube channels do you watch?
 This is primarily an anime website so it shouldn't suprise anybody that I like channels like the Funimation or Nozomient channels, actually Nozomient has Space Adventure Cobra, Ah! My Buddha, Princess Nine, and I think even Revolutionary Girl Utena videos as well. Also there may be dozens or more videos where people list their favorite anime series and a lot of anime reviews too. Heh, heh, I also like the videos where folks made "bombs" by mixing water and dry ice in a plastic container and boom! I even seen one where a trash can filled with water split open from the blast of the dry ice bomb! Also videos where girls dance around in their underwear, I'm such a Hentai! Basically there is a lot of info about anime on YouTube that I can take advantage of!
