 What do people around you think about you watching anime ?
 Supporting, My cousins and my sisters like watching anime with me but others could really care less what im into. I draw a lot of anime I've actually had my own manga running in the news papers here. In art class my teacher let me work on my comics. XD. My sister and her boyfriend are completing the first season of Inuyasha. Completing. ? Is that even a word?
