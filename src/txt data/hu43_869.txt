[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 I'm liking this series so far its one of the many I do enjoy for the spring season. Although, I do want to find out how this whole partner thing with L-Elf will turn out, and who will pilot the other Valvrave's.
