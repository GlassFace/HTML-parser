 Hi there.
 Im always really bad at these but I feel like I should say something before just jumping in. I joined the forum forever ago, but didnt really do much at all from the looks of it except message around with some people. Like I actually forgot I joined so when I went to sign up it was telling me I had an account. XD Anyways Feel free to call me Ayna. Im 25 and have been watching anime since I was 8. Though Ive become a bit laxed in it over the years. I mostly know older shows and re-watch them quite often (mostly the old toonami days and early adult swim). But some newer shows do squeeze in every couple of years. Currently I am watching the new season of Aldnoah.Zero which is my main show as well as Akatsuki no Yona. I tend to watch mostly, mecha, magical girl, or shoujo. And in my free time when I get it I game and make pixel fanart. I also go to Otakon every now and then. So yeah. If you have any other questions or just want to talk feel free to PM me or ask here. ^^ 
 Welcome back! So I assume you've seen madoka magica. Have you seen the wixoss series???

 Yes I have seen Madoka. An online friend of mine kept talking about when it was airing and got me into it. It was actually one of my favorites that year. ^o^ I can't say I've heard of the Wixoss one though. What genre is it? 
 Selector infected wixoss and selector spread wixoss are magical girl shows (the same series). Its about a card game but there are magical girls in the cards. They do battles on an arena of a sorts. Its incredibly emotional and really well done. There aren't any filler episodes And the voice cast is just so perfect!

 Hmm. I might have to give it a try on my next day off. I googled images for it and it looks like it's something I could be into. The art looks kind of familiar too, not like the characters but the artstyle. I can't really place it though... ^_^'' 
 Its produced by JC staff. Here's a link to their wiki page and the shows they produced: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.C.Staff I'm sure there would be some similitarities when a company makes a bunch of shows. I know you'll like it

 Wow, they've done a lot! I see a lot of older titles I know like Slayers, Somedays Dreamers, Ai Yori Aoshi, and Excel Saga as well as some newer ones that I've seen people posting about over the years. No wonder I thought Wixoss looked familiar. ^^ 
 Welcome aboard Ayna. Be sure to have a great time posting and discovering new shows to watch.

 Thanks, Kuze the Devil. I'm looking forward to them. ^^ Oh I think I was Ta-Ka. I was going though my profile settings yesterday and noticed I had put in a fake birth date so I was probably 12. I did that quite a bit back then. I think most forums require you to be 13 or at least they did back then. I still remember thinking that there was going to be some horrible consequence for lying about it, but in my defense we had only had the Internet for a little over a year and I was completely new to everything. 
 Welcome back!! have fun!!

 Thank you for the welcomes everyone! ^_^ 
 Hey nice intro, welcome back to the site. I'm similar to you in the way you watch anime now, I usually just spend my time exploring through my old anime if I ever get in the mood for it. Either way, nice to meet you. I'm new here lol
