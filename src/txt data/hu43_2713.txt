 Songs you wouldn't want ur friends to know you enjoy.
 Songs that aren't considered "cool" that u secretly listin to when alone. My favorite music is classic rock like the who, AcDc, Led Zepplin, the beatles.. And I also enjoy rap from time to time, mainly eminem. The songs I secretly enjoy that I would find embarrassing if my friends were to find out are : "Nesum Dorma" by Pavarotti. This song gets me every time, plus Pavarotti has the strongest voice of all time imo, "What the water gave me" by florence and the Machine. And every Adele song ever written. 

 Justin Bieber, One Direction, Backstreet, NSync, Sam Smith, etc. If I cared anyway. Well, I care a little bit, but it's not like I wouldn't listen to it because they're there. 
 I personally don't have any so.gs I am embarrased to let people know I listen to. I don't really liaten to any new songs. I o.ly really listen to the extended versions of songs that are used for intros and outros and some that are used i. the middle of anime like Fairy Tails main theme.

 @js - that's OK you're a girl so you get a free pass on those selections. Me? I don't know. I love nightmare on my street by the fresh prince. Funny thing is I don't like horror and I don't like rap. Maybe its because I love weird al and parody music and this is sort of a parody song. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 Mmm songs that id never want my friends to know... I guess some songs that have a heavy metal feel to them. Im known to enjoy EDM/Trance/Chill-step as well as jazz. So it would be kind of shocking for then to know that i listen to songs like those

 Music like anything else is subjective so if i like what I like and my friends don't it's not a big deal. Unless they choose to not be my my friend anymore in which case they were never truely my friend to begin with

When I was younger, I think I used to like them, I remember I had a hoodie which had Busted on the front of it, It was a zipped hoodie and I loved it purely because the Name Busted has like a 'torn' affect, as if it had been torn into the hoodie. haha, loved that top.

 Only my really close friends know what kind of music I love, most of the rock and metal genre, j-pop, j-rock, classic with symphonies and piano pieces and to put everything under a roof instead of listing all the genres I like: most soundtracks from animes. Those I'm acquainted with from my school time think I'm a metal-head who listens to nothing but brutal death metal with screaming and growling all the time. o-o' But one time, a couple of years ago when I was listening to Owl City, I tried to hide that fact from my friend weirdly enough. Although he doesn't like the music taste, I know he wouldn't judge me.

 None at all. My friends are well aware of the songs I listen to. I honestly don't see the point in hiding your music taste from your friends. Its pretty stupid.

 Why would anyone want to hide something from their friends? Me for once have no problems standing for what I enjoy, and if they don't like it, fine by me, no ones forcing them to listen to it. Whilst I may listen to K-POP or J-POP, originating from a country where its hardly heard of, I know some of my friends listen to even weirder ****.

 Well if you will let your friends/other people control you pretty sure you will not have a happy life. If your friends hates you cause you listen to a kind of music that they hate they are not called friends they are just bunch of idiots stickin with you cause they need something. All of my friends don't know anything bout animes/j-pop songs but they still know that I love watching and listening to this kind of music. Oh well people have different likings. I don't even know why some people judge other because they want to listen to japanese songs or when they want anime. Sad truth is we live in a world that is full of judgement.
