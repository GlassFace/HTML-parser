Oh the horrors.. why? Such a crime! Out of all the atrocities! It's okay to pick! I swear!

 WELL THEN, I believe this is something that everyone should have seen coming from a mile away BUT, time to bust out the party equipment and celebrate this occasion lol

 This event gives a lot of people whom have put Justin on a pedestal to criticize him for doing whatever he wanted. It gives the supposed excuse and reason for everyone to judge him when we are all just as bad in one way or another.

I hope you realize that he puts himself there (much like Miley Cyrus herself - she admits it, she does it), and probably enjoys the attention, and also lastly could care less for people like you, me, or anyone else "criticizing" him - because he'll be laughing all the way to the bank regardless. So honestly, don't white knight someone like him. lol. It doesn't help anyone any, and you're not doing yourself any favors, my friend. :<

 Now now Tova, I'm sure he's holding back on the wit and intelligence until he gets more bites. Devils advocating ain't eeazaaay. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro?

 Originally Posted by BuddyLee I never would have imagined that putting yourself on the same level as a drunk driver could be interpreted as taking a social high ground... But clearly we are all wrong because we judge bieber when we too have also done equally as horrid things. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone! Or is that not a social high ground? Because I am looking down on you right now from a greater elevation.

You'd probably be correct if the pronoun "we" didn't mean that the statement following it also applied to the person speaking. "We've all made mistakes" is probably not the best example of somebody taking a moral highground. I mean, the guy's full of **** of course, but I'm just kind of saying that your choice of words was pretty bad. Hope that clears up any confusion my post has caused you.

I too enjoy drunk driving and resisting arrest. cuz I'm a straight baller and play by my own rules. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

I am focusing on the people that are judging him. We could be focusing on news much more important than a singer arrested for DUI. 
 I'm going to go ahead and play this game and argue that the "shouldn't focus on bieber when worse **** is out there" sentiment is a joke. For every news story anyone wants to talk about or interrupt there will be a million worse or more pertinent news stories. What would you focus on? It's crazy how capitalism works, if people go elsewhere for news then you need to find a way to remain competitive, part of that might be in the way you select and report on news stories. I'm sure many here are aware of the expression "vote with your wallets," well in the internet age you can vote with your views.

 Originally Posted by SageoftheDawn I never stated he was perfect. I am focusing on the people that are judging him. We could be focusing on news much more important than a singer arrested for DUI. I'm not perfect. But there's a difference between being imperfect and having no common sense. I can see why many people in the US would think Justin Beiber is more important than American Politics. Most of those people know who lives in a pineapple under the sea but don't know who lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (as evidenced by Jaywalking with Jay Leno). But the key component to this story going by this thread is: someone famous/wealthy was drunk driving, could've killed someone, and essentially got off with nada. Again, I'm not perfect. But whatever else can be said about me, I'm not lacking in common sense. Justin Beiber can afford to buy my home at least 8 times. He can't afford a bodyguard/driver? If anything where the hell is the justice system?

If anything where the hell is the justice system? There is no doubt in my mind that he'll be prosecuted aggressively. My friend got a DUI, and while he got really ****ed for it, it was nowhere near as bad as when Britney Spears got hers. They tend to make examples out of stars and the bigger they are the harder they fall. Despite this, even if he goes to jail he'll still be richer than all of us combined. Nothing's ever gonna change that fact. Thanks Canada. 
 apprently justin beiber is just to good for the congresswoman. MSNBC needs to realize that it's this bullshit that's scaring off the 30 liberal nutjobs from watching them. 
 Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide. *Bill The Butcher - Gangs Of New York*
