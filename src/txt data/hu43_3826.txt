 Favorite Mystery Anime?
 In anime, my favorite mistery anime is Monster defintely, because the characters are very realistic and humans, the plot was a great idea in the world of anime, the ambientation was perfect for the style, the antagonist was one of the most creepy antagonist that I've seen in an anime, definitely a semi Master piece.
