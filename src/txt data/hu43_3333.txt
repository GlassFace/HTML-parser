 The Pirate Bay SHUTDOWN - Page 2
 I just heard that thepiratebay was shut down from my friend. I personally don't torrent but I found that it was interesting that they managed to shut it down since apparently the pirate bay isn't technically an "illegal" site for some reason or another. I looked up some news about it, and apparently there was a police raid in sweden to shut it down...and another site called oldpiratebay was put up just after. Apparently its almost completely identical to thepiratebay. Lol... http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/16/p...own-explainer/
