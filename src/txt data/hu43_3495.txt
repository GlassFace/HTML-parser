 Why isn't Sakurasou No Pet Na Kanojo famous?
 Sakurasou No Pet Na Kanojo is a dramatic masterpiece. Excellently written, with hilarious dialogue and moving moments it has unique underlying themes such as natural talent vs hard work, the importance of ambitions and belonging. This anime, based off the light novel of the same name, will have you coming out thinking "I should really work harder to achieve my goals". Don't get me started on the beautiful art, or how kawaii Shiina is. You see the characters develop and get through hard times. Unlike most anime where the character has an initial failure then becomes stronger, Sorata fails and fails and fails again, but gets right back up and becomes a better person. He's actually sort of a jerk in the beginning. You see how Shiina turns from an inept, expressionless eccentric into a (more) sociable, reliable person. So why is it still not very well known? It should at the very least be as popular as Clannad. EDIT: I realise I put the title down in the wrong format. Sorry, I don't know how to edit it
