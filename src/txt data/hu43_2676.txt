[Event] Anime Review Competition
 Gaaaaah. Should had included them earlier but the review section has some rules of its own. This forum is for REVIEWS ONLY, That means no chit chat, NO DISCUSSION. If you would like to comment on someone's review... PM them. If you post is anything other than a review it will be deleted. More than one review is allowed per anime. Just add your review in whatever thread the same way you would with any regular post. But your review needs to be constructive. Label spoilers... or just avoid them completely. If any info is wrong in the original post... PM a mod so they can fix it So try to avoid major things like "character X dies," unless it's part of the premise like the 1990 film Ghost (I feel old.) If you want to talk about a character's death you should add a layer of ambiguity, even if it's just "unspecified characters die."
