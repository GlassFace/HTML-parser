 The Big 3 Manga (Is is worth it?)
 If your asking my opinion I would recommend that you do one at a time since there all so dense and complicated. you wouldn't want to OD on manga. also I would say finish bleach manga over the other two. it has the best manga of the three skip out on the one pice and naruto manga and transfer over to the actual anime. anime versions of one piece and naruto are better.
