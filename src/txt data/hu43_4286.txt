 Power Rangers Dino Charge!
 Saw the western version in the 90's. *cut to scene of bigass robot whipping out bigass lazor sword and defeating enemy of the week* ^Basically every episode ever. The movie was hilarious. Not seen it in years but I do remember kinda liking it. I also had awful taste in everything back then. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro?
