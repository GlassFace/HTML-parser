[General Discussion] Hero V. Villain
 I always find this discussion interesting when i'm with a group of friends, and it's usually a conversation full of odd creativity. But I like seeing what people come up with. Interesting enough, i've heard people say villain. If you lived in a world to where you were given a decision to be a Hero or Villain, 1. What would you be? (Hero or Villain) 2. What would be your name? (If you decided to change your real name) 3. Given the option to (ONLY) receive 2 powers, what would they be?
