[Manga] Are the sao mangas on kindle the same as the originals?
 Just curious. It seems like the show followed the manga verbatim. Or is this a rare instance where the manga came after the show? I finished aincrad the other day and loved reading it. I actually haven't watched any sao season one shows since last summer before season 2. Then it was just the extra edition movie. (I'm reading alo now But anyway are the kindle versions originals and not novelizations so to speak?
