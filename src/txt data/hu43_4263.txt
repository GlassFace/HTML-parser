[Personal Life Discussions] College Studies, What are You Enrolled For?
 A4, Are you in college? What are you enrolled for? Do you like it? Personally, I think college is a waste of time and money, but can anyone prove me wrong? I am considering Cn'C (computer numeric control) and going into machinery for the company I work for. Is it really worth it? Please share your experiences in college and if it was worth what you paid! I work in a field that is comprised mostly of computers and machinery and I have thought about going to college for it since the company pays for it, so why not? HOWEVER, what was your college experience like? Was it worth it A4? I look forward to reading what you respond! 
 It was only a matter of time... Now I am one with the night and stars again... Thank you, Rhyme's Law, for your signature art work.
