 Account Activation
 Hi guys, Some people seem to be having issues with activating their accounts. If you didn't get an activation email from anime-forums, please check your spam. You may also have received one from Bryce@something so check for that too. Check back after 30 mins and if there is still no email, please send a Private Message to Shian stating that you didn't receive an email. He should get to it within 48 hours. Myself or any another available moderator will also pass along the message to have your account activated, so feel free to contact one of us too. Admins are working atm to sort out this issue. It appears to affect only a select few signups, so most people should be able to activate without any problems. ^^ Sorry for the inconvenience. A4 staff.
