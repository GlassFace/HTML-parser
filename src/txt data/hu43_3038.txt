 I joined a gym
 Yep just did it today. Its a regional chain. I should be seeing a trainer tomorrow if one is available. I'm excited. I think should push me to that next level. I feel good about my decision. They have the usual equipment. I plan on going at least two or three times a week and once on the weekends. Its only a couple miles away so travel isn't a problem. I'm hoping this will keep motivated long term. I tend to do these workout sessions in spurts. A few weeks here and there and then long stretches of no activity. I'll be sure to report back after my session.
