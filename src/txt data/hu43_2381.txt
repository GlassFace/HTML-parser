 You have to read the fault in our stars!
 I'm with MilkChan. I'm not really a fan of Green's works. Not that they aren't good. I just don't see the appeal of TFIOS or his other novels, and it seems he follows a similar formula for most of them. I watched the movie and read passages from TFIOS but I didn't like the characters. Hazel seems fine, but I feel like Gus overshadowed her and I'm not really a fan of his character. My sister loves the book and Green though. The movie didn't do anything for me, much to my sister's despair. lol She was upset that I wasn't a puddle of tears but I'm not sure, it just didn't... do anything for me. The storyline has potential itself but it's probably just the characters are a turn off for me. Still better than Twilight.
