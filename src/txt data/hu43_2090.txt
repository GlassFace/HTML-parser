What was it like for you to go to a convention if you have been on one. Go...! I was at one called NärCon last summer and I loved it. NärCon is for anime/manga/game lovers and general geeks... There are so many things you can do at conventions and the mood is awesome. You meet a lot of unique people and get to try things that are difficult to find at any other place. Though yeah as some has written it´s really noisy, full of people everywhere and on summer convents it can be rather painful if you are sensitive to heat and intense sunlight. I had a great time and me and my friends are going again this summer x) I hope the League of Legends SoloQ won´t be cancelled this year though D:
