 World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor
 Actually, the fact that the game functioned at all made this the smoothest launch Blizz has done in a long time. I managed to get through all of the initial Draenor invasion stuff without the slightest hint of lag and only began experiencing problems when it was time to build my garrison. I decided to call it quits before I even gained a level since I had stuff to do the follow morning anyway. Vanilla flat-out didn't work for a whole day, as I recall, and each subsequent expansion after that suffered similar issues that wouldn't allow you to play at all for many hours. And if you're looking for the worst launch ever just remember how long it took to play Diablo III.
