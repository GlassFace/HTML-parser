 X-Men Comics
 I like the X-Men films, but I have never read the comic. As someone who has never read a single X-Men comic book, what is a good series to start with? My favorite characters from the film are Magneto and Wolverine, so any series involving those characters specifically would be great, but it's not a requirement.
