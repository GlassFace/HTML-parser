 Alright guys, it's been over two weeks, so I think that we might have to end or at least postpone the current storyline, in favor of a new one. Since we have Skyler and recently Kekiin here with new characters, we can take some of our characters that are not in use, or free up some of our characters that are in use and work around that. As such, I know that my character Elise is not really doing anything. And I am sure Victoria is no in any thing either (though I know she is looking for John). Hope you guys respond soon. Oh, by the way, Kekininjagirl, your character is hereby accepted. Welcome to the Glass Academy. 
  Spoiler 
 sounds sweet what did u have in mind randoms ? 
 Well I'm still here, and Raph's in stasis right now. So I guess he's free. 
 I would rather continue with the current storyline but I do see your point. I will take Kyrs and have her interact if possible when I get the chance. A bit worried right now, have to admit that this roleplay is getting really slow and I am starting to lose a bit of hope but I am willing to try and help bring it back up if the rest of you do as well . Randoms, it seems as if you are truly dedicated to this roleplay and that is so great.But... where did Danny run off to? 
If we make it back to the real world. Ill find you again. And fall in love with you again.~Asuna, SAO "Lets accept each others weak points; love that touches one another is invincible; we who bloom are the protagonists" ~Tamaki, OHSHC' Thanks so Much to Takera for the siggy! 
 I would like a new story 2 I don't want to sit and read text for a half a hour to catch up 
 I think when Danny posts, if she posts, then things might have a short burst of speed again. And I do feel kind of dedicated to this Rp because this is sort of where I made a name for myself on this site, if that's even possible. Anyway, as for a branching storyline, I am not sure what we can do, I guess we can start with some scenario to get the characters together. Now, the fight in the courtyard was not that long ago, so maybe there could be a crowd surrounding the damage from the small fire, and broken sprinkler head. So far in this Rp, we have been making stuff up as we go alone until we find a goal and then play to achieve it. I know Elise is in the courtyard, Skyler can easily remove her character from the headmaster scene if she wants to. Kekin has not introduced her character yet, that's three females. and Kyrs. (funny since we complained of too many males at the Rp several months ago) So, Perhaps, Kekin, you could introduce your character doing something generic, or not doing something generic that leave an opening for someone else. Like maybe your character recognized Elise or Kyrs or some other not in use character, and runs up to them about homework or wants to be a friend or something. I could also design a temp character to be used as a point of interest that attracts other characters together. A bully, ladies man, prankster, very popular female (since most popular males are taken by Danny's characters). I might be over thinking this. 
  Spoiler 
 No, you're putting just the right amount of thought into it. I like where you're going. My character Victoria isn't really up to much, so most rpers have characters lying around somewhere.... With some brainstorming we can figure this out. 
 Your putting good thought into this~ and please call me keki not kekin, and force flex, maybe my charter could recognize your charter in the crowed around were the fight would be~ we need to get inactive charters out and focuse on active charters and clean this RP thread and make more role play again~ ^w^

 Wow I like that idea and I can easly move my character to a new location 
 Nomatter what, you are going to have to read back at most of the pages Keki. Can't let yourself get lazy in this roleplay or you will get very lost fast.@Randoms, I agree with the others, I am truly loving this idea and I could also bring Rumor back in if needed, she is truly a fun character. So I guess, how are we all going to start this? That is the most difficult question since we have to make it in a way for once Danny returns then she can make a decent post without be affected way too much. We don't want to screw with the current storyline too much. What happened to Danny anyways? It has been a while since she has posted even in the OOC . 
If we make it back to the real world. Ill find you again. And fall in love with you again.~Asuna, SAO "Lets accept each others weak points; love that touches one another is invincible; we who bloom are the protagonists" ~Tamaki, OHSHC' Thanks so Much to Takera for the siggy! 
 She probably just got slammed with college work. Midterms are coming up and she probably is just making sure she's not going to fail. College can get pretty rough. Give her time. There's probably more than this RP on her mind right now. 
 Thanks for keeping this RP alive, Randoms. Personally, I'd love to at least have my character meet her new roommate and get situated in her new dorm. Anything else that comes after/before that is fine by me too. I suppose I could make a new character, but with all the **** going on in my personal life right now I might not be able to put up anything decent. Edit: Also, Randoms, sorry about the RP tournament thing. I've been distracted with real life stuff and problems with my medication for the past while now. It's been hard to get on and do the things I enjoy.
