 Recommend me a Horror anime.
 Now, I know that sounds silly coming from someone like me but, I'm well aware of most horror related anime. I'm just not sure which one I should try next. Perhaps there's a gem out there I haven't heard of as well. Anyway please consider a few things. In my signature there's a link to my MAL which has all the anime I've watched. I've watched just about ever popular horror anime. Such as, Higurashi, Hell Girl, Shiki, Boogiepop Phantom, GYO, etc. so please look at my list before you rec something. I have an objective view on what some people call horror. I don't think Tokyo Ghoul, or Elfen Lied for example are really horror. Thriller maybe but, gore doesn't equal horror in my eyes. I like really atmosphere driver stories. I have a long list of dropped series as well. Such as Tokyo Ghoul, and Mushishi which is dark but, a little slow in my opinion. I'll also accept thriller or dark anime such examples would be Serial Experiments Lain. Anyway thanks in advance!
