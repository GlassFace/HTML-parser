[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires - Page 2
 Alright, I've seen 2 eps...and I'm shocked about this anime. It's pretty surprising, The madness must continue on.

 Yeah that was obviously full on rape that her perpetrated against Saki. Or at least the vampire AI did. Still not sure what to think about it really. I think it'll all depend on how it's handled in the following episode.

 Ok so I'm on the app, and it's not on the stream anymore. Anyone else having this same problem? 

 Wow... Episode 10 was shocking, but also very sad and moving. I really feel sorry for Shoko. This is why Haruto distanced himself from her, knowing that he is cursed.

 I'm only 2 episodes into this but I have to say I really enjoy it so far. Haruto (i think thats his name) is such an interesting character because he comes off as a useless kind of person, similar to many shounen lead characters, but is actually a lot smarter than he leads on. He loses the eating contest on purpose, doesnt tell shoko he likes her, and he does these things with much thought put into them and has much higher motives than what is on the surface. I really love this anime so far for the main character because he is really a different kind of lead seen in many manga.

 Episode 11 Wow, two shocker episodes right after each other. This is really proving itself to be one bad-ass anime!

  Spoiler First Haruto raped Rukino............now He's asking for marriage? This anime is colourful twisted

 Omg... are you frikin serious.. This is crazy. Am I the only one that laughed when  Spoiler L-elf pulled out his gun about to shoot Shoko, if she made the wrong call? Like Damn lolo Andd Ok So Haruto feels like he can't be with Shoko anyway because he's not human anymore, and he feels like he's not good enough for her. So did he  Spoiler ask Rion to marry him, because he didn't want her to be "alone" anymore? And he feels like he HAS to because he raped her? Like I have no clue.  Spoiler AND did L-elf anticipate the soldiers making their way inside? Seeing as he didn't write this down, maybe he didn't. But maybe he did, and he wanted to just take things into his own hands. I just don't know what to think.

This anime has gotten so much better over the last two episodes because all of the craziness but  Spoiler As a love interest I believe Rukino and Haruto just make sense she was the kids first kiss lol and I wouldn't necessarily call it rape because at the end of the day she wanted it to happen because she gave in when she could have done something to stop it. As for Shoko I feel bad for her because they both had mutual feelings for each other but I also believe Haruto didn't choose Rukino out of pity because I think he to had feelings for her as she did him. On a side note L-elf is badass regardless lol

On a side note L-elf is badass regardless lol To anyone, is this anime really any good or just crazy as f*ck, cause if it's just crazy I rather not pick up the anime again. How's the story, is there anything to it? Oh, and is the main character still a wimp, if he is then no matter how good the story is I won't be picking it up. I only saw the first episode and he was a wimp there so if that has continued well into the 12th episode I won't pick it up.

 You only watched the first episode? usually one should watch the first 2 or three to get a real feel of an anime. But whatever. And Mooo, what do you think? Assuming you've read a little through the thread, these past episode, It seems your interested. Just watch a few eps.

Assuming you've read a little through the thread, these past episode, It seems your interested. Just watch a few eps. From what I saw in the first episode was the main character is a wimp and I hate when guys are wimps, which is one main reason why I hated Deadman Wonderland and Future Diary. But I also hated it cause I predicted the death of that chick right from the beginning. It's not good story telling, that part at least, not the wimpy main character plus with the rape I still don't want to and that's why I want a review, to see if there are any good qualities to the show besides the craziness.

This is why you don't drop something after the first episode Mo.

There's no need to google a review seeing as the anime is nowhere near over, just because you didn't seem to like it from the first episode doesn't mean it doesn't get better, in fact it gets way better so I'd suggest you pick it back up again and watch it through. You won't be disappointed.

I only saw the first episode and he was a wimp there so if that has continued well into the 12th episode I won't pick it up. I have trouble telling if it's good or not honestly, but I think it's very entertaining. A lot of it seems to be Bandai and Sunrise having some fun with the usual mecha tropes. Like, wildcards keep getting thrown in on a regular basis every episode, but it's written well enough that it doesn't feel like it's ever actually jumped the shark. The story itself has gotten a lot more defined, although quite a bit darker as well. The main character, Haruto, hasn't changed a whole lot fundamentally, but he definitely gets stronger as it's progressed. Overall I like it a lot, definitely one of the best shows this season. I'd say watch episode 2 and/or 3 and if it doesn't grab you by then it's probably just not the show for you. It mostly hasn't taken itself too seriously and I think some people may have gotten the wrong impression about it with the way it started. Because of that I think you might have trouble finding a reviewer who is going to be able to give you the sort of analysis you're looking for; how any given person interprets the show is going to strongly rely on how much mecha they've watched, especially stuff like Code Geass or Gundam SEED and similiar.

Either way, I was expecting a reply from you and I figured you'll give me the best understanding of the show up to now. And considering the first episode and what's been said and what I've read up to now in this thread, I won't be picking it up again. I don't want to force myself to watch something like I did with future diary which I regret to this day due to how bad it was. Plus I don't see mechs as a good story element, they are there to help those that control them like any show about humans controlling something...I could word this better I'm just not with it today. Anyway the comparison is with a show like Girls Und Panzer which I loved. Anyway thanks for the help Ian and making this simple.

 Yeah man, no problem. The mechs in this show are definitely more of a plot device than just a tool, especially given the effect they have on their pilots. I think that's what you're going for with that anyway; they have more focus than something like the tanks in Girls und Panzer for sure.
