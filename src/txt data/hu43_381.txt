 What are you currently Playing?
 I bounce between Red Dead Redemption, Pokemon X, Any Harvest Moon game, Singstar and Rock Band. 
Leader of the .hack group, member of group leaders, the anthro group, and the Union of Fruits Basket. Â Spoiler sig & avi by the sweet Miko-chan<3 I became insane with long bouts of terrible sanity.
