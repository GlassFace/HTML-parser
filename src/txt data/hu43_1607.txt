It felt more like playful banter or honest criticism when he and Red went at it, which was nice. I think he was still a smug jerk. His Japanese kinda gave it away. 
We are just 'one' within the 'all.' But only when those 'ones' gather together can 'all' exist. - Edward Elric. 
 He was but it was written a lot more competently was my point. Sorry if that was unclear! 

 HAHAHA! I was to lazy to. lmao Originally Posted by Scumbag Ixi was here Thanks for making the topic, I was too lazy. This show is pure unmitigated fanservice for all of us faithful fans who have been playing for the past 17 years.

 Was cool seeing the movesets change and Red actually use TMs too, Charizard having Mega Punch, Mega Kick, Fire Blast, and I think Seismic Toss. 

 Damn Episode 4, The last pokemon! That Giovanni man so much nostalgia, when I was a little kid I had a friend that lived in the same street as me *he moved away a few years ago* his name was Giovanny, I would always do pokemon battles with him. I'd always make a joke about how I beat him at the gym. the feels

 Yep, the 'earth throw' move was indeed seismic toss.

 Well I finally saw Origins. It was not quite as good as I expected it to be but than again with all of it subbed and well. The entire game compressed into 4 short episodes I was not expecting a whole ton but it was alright. I cannot help but feel that half the reason for this was to introduce mega evolutions though.

I agree by like over 9000. 
 This little OVA was awesome. There was no Ash whining and crying every other day, no Jesse, James, and Meowth around which the series was completely based despite their ridiculous incompetence, and it actually progressed very rapidly. We didn't have to see Red get a Charmeleon, and later on a Charizard, and then watch in pain as he can't ****ing use it for 150 episodes. He didn't get a Pigeot in an awesome battle and then just give it away for no reason. He didn't send all of his Pokemon away one by one and then start from level 1 again. He actually used evolved forms of Pokemon. His final team was pretty cool, with Jolteon, Snorlax, Charizard, and Scyther. The battle with Giovanni was incredibly well done. Safe to say the only good Pokemon series ever. 
 Is there a review thread for this? This was darker than I was expecting it to be... Also the first team rocket encounter is important imo, but they didnt have it... and giovanni turns into a pussy... did that happen in the ganes too?

 Honestly i thought all the voices were perfect for each character... but some of the translations really confused me... i was annoyed that the pokemon had names like Lizardon (Charizard)... and so other than the names... I really wanna play the games again, because it reminded me of all the same stuff i did in the games aswell... and Ive only started to watch pokemon X & Y (anime) 
Watch It!!! Or I'll Take Your Soul

The names we know are the localized ones.

 One thing I hated was that it was 4 episodes...If they did like 72 It might be the best thing ever. 

 I watched these all at once, and it was so much to see all of that animated. Fifteen years of waiting, and I was not displeased. However, I was sad that it was only four episodes, because I think by this point the fans that recognize all of that and played gen one deserve more than four episodes. xD; 
 
 I loved the series it was brilliant but I feel like it would have been longer cause the skipped over so much key points in the game :/ And also I would love to see this continue into the Gold and Silver games. 
Always looking for good animes so if you know any tell me! Thanks Youtube channel: www.youtube.com/kaboomitsjoey
 Its about time a real pokemon show comes on. 
 In reality, all men are sculptors, constantly chipping away the unwanted parts of their lives trying to create a masterpiece.
 I finally knocked out these 4 episodes this afternoon. It was pretty awesome, exactly what I had hoped for our of 4 short episodes. The last episode was a complete blast, I loved how Charizard was pretty much the centerpiece. The bit at the end with Mewtwo was dope too, the animation for Mewtwo's attacks made my inner kid absolutely giddy.

 Wait what, I thought this was just a rumor, you mean It's actually real sigh? I don't know if I should laugh or be intrigued that IG, and Xebec would dare to touch this with a 12 ft pole(never heard of OLM though, what did they make). Those are great companies, why would they involve themselves in a project, that pretty much everyone but bottom feeders would be avoiding like the plague? It's bad that anyone would make a 4 ep OVA over a min of 26 ep series, but atleast It's not a never ending, rinse, wash, wipe repeat BS for 700+ ep, so It's already shaping up to be way better then the original series, no matter how much It's doomed to suck, it will be way better then the original series. 
 Nice sh*t post, maybe you should actually watch it before trashing it. 

 Yeah, we all know you have terrible opinions, Zoltor. You don't need to keep reminding us.

Also no, the "but it was like my first anime" has no baring whatso ever on quality/how good a anime is. To Ian: Nothing good can come out of 4 ep, what's the point. Nothing that makes anime really good, could possibly be jammed into 4 ep(story, char development, world building, chemistry between the char/cast, great soundtracks, ect). 4 ep is usually what people check out when "trying" to figure out if they're gonna like a anime, if that's the entire anime, man talk about a shallow, and pointless anime.
