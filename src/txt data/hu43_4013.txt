[Anime] Scare the s**t out of me. I dare you.
 Hmmm scare you huh....anime doesn't really have anything that's scary but, I can tell you some of the scenes in the Corpse Party anime made me cringe. Otherwise maybe some of the scenes in Higurashi. And I'll throw in Shiki which has some really chilling scenes. If you want something that will make you question what reality is and end up crying in a corner from your mental state. Try the visual novel Saya no Uta. It still haunts me. If you don't know what a visual novel is Google it I guess. I know you said anime but, truely there isn't much scary anime. Oh and Boogiepop Phantom but, you might not like the style. There's some pretty chilling manga out there. Anything from Junji Ito. One of my favorites from him is Uzumaki. Then there's the truely creepy Ibitsu it's the one with the girl on the from cover I think I'm not sure who wrote it. Those to come to mind when I think of something that creeped me out. But if you're not afraid of reading go with Saya no Uta. Oh it's 18+ though and there are some brutal sexual abuse scenes. It's a story meant to seriously scar your brain.
