[Anime] the worst anime u have ever watched!! - Page 2
 we have a lot of threads talking about top anime or the best anime of all. so i wanted to know whats the worst anime you have ever watched for me i'd have to go with school days. the main character is a sh** head that does some pretty stupid stuff. and the plot of the story sucks so bad. i mean how can girls fall for u when u have such a sh**y personality Â Spoiler plus he thinks that he isn't doing anything wrong when he cheats on them ... anyway post the most terrible anime u have ever watched, im looking forward to your replies
