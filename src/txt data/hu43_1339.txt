[Action] Hajime no Ippo Season 3
 The 3rd opening was actually my least favorite of the 3 from the original series. These episodes focusing on Aoki have been hilarious. Ippo is not disappointing so far.

The dreams of those who have fallen, the hopes of those who will follow. Those two sets of dreams weaved together into a double helix drilling a path towards tomorrow. And that's Tengen Toppa! That's Gurren Lagann! My drill is the drill, that creates the heavens!"~ Simon
