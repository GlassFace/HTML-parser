 GS 1.0 - Anime, Gaming And J-Pop/Rock Band
 Following the sad news that Monty Oum has passed away, my bandmates and I felt moved enough to create a tribute to him. We love RWBY, and Monty inspired many elements of the band, including some of our costumes, our weapons, and a few songs too. We recorded a medley of songs from RWBY, including This Will Be The Day, From Shadows, I Burn, Red Like Roses and Mirror Mirror. Here it is if you'd like to check it out. RIP Monty, you're already hugely missed! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o3Q03spukQ
