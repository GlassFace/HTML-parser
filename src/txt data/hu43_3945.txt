[Personal Life Discussions] I keep scratching my arms till I bleed
 Even if you're already being treated for the eczema, there is still something they may be able to do for you. It could be stress related. Everyone suffers from some sort of stress related crap at some point in their lives and it's easy sorted out most of the time. Don't just dismiss it like that. Continually scratching yourself up can start to lead to other problems over time like skin cancer because you'll have scarring upon scarring that your body is trying to repair constantly and you keep tearing away. I am not trying to scare you, but it's an issue that you need to get sorted. Worry about the cosplay last, your health first. The only people who can give you the right advice and look into your condition are your doctor.
