 What's your high school life look like?
 Many Japanese animes talk about school life. But it shouldn't be the same as high school lifes in reality. What's the high school life of you guys look like? In high school, I had to stay in the school from 7:30-17:30 and there were 8 classes each day. There were some homework to do after school and I usually took about 2 hours to finish them. Some review was essential especially before exams. Overall, I had to spent much time on studying. However, we still had some school activities, the form of these activities were similar to that shown in animes. In addition, our school always organize a trip in spring and autumn, that was one of the most wonderful activities. I think the high school life in animes are too relaxed. It may not be the real school life even in Japan.
