 Journal Entry 1 - Ricky  Spoiler I am not smart, average, probably less. I am also big, fat is a good word but I do not like to use it. I have deep black skin and am of African American decent. People make fun of me for all three and over the years I have gotten used to it, it is not fun and I do not like being used to it. The other students at my school are not nice and the only people I trust are my family. My kind mother who I have called Mum since I was young and my father, Pa. My mum is a physical therapist at our school. I feel this is because of me but I do not what her to think that. She seems happy so I do not want to ruin that for her. My pa is a police officer, high ranking too and hugs me every time he comes back from work, glad to be alive another day. Were we live is not unsafe but pa still treats work as if he would not come home that night. When I was young this was very hard for me to understand but I know now and like his work. Mrs. Keen gave me this journal at the end of the day yesterday and has asked me to follow what is written in the inside cover. Waiting until I got home from school that night as told, I opened the journal and found a photograph of a field. The journal also said follow the rumors but I do not understand. I was told this is my duty alone and I would get a letter grade up if I did well but I do not understand. I am surprised that I have written this much, I do not usually but it is for a grade. Earlier my mum wanted me to talk with a guy in a wheelchair named Luke but he was not focused on why he came to the room. Usually for exercise, he asked my mom to go check on the girls bathroom. He said he heard crying and when my mom came back, she brought with her a witch. I stayed out of it while they talked but that girl seemed so sad, I hope she feels better. 384 Words This was kind of hard to write because I love using descriptive words but considering who I am writing and trying to get a feel for him, I went with simple words as much as possible as well as trying to keep the entry short yet having everything I want in it. I'm also going to make a few changes to the prologue, the thing about the cards being a year apart from when this actually starts is too distant. I'm making it so its on their first day so by now, we are only on the third day so far of the week. Those cards are going to have a greater meaning then I had previously thought and I thank having to spend a few hours shoveling the snow and my long trips to and from work.
