[General Discussion] Body Modification
 In all seriousness, my trolling aside, I believe there's nothing wrong with tattoos or piercings. Would I ever do it? No. Should that mean nobody else should? Absolutely not. Just because one person wouldn't do it shouldn't stop another person from doing it. If someone feels they must physically get a permanent marking to reflect who or what they are, it's not my place to disrespect it. 
 It was only a matter of time... Now I am one with the night and stars again... Thank you, Rhyme's Law, for your signature art work.
