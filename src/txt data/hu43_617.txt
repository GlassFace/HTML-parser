 Fantasy Books
 That's a pretty damn good reading list, only one I haven't read is The Long Earth and The Long War. Since I'm in the fantasy thread might as well have a ramble about book series. Brandon Sanderson- The pace he puts out books is astonishing. Reckoners isn't as good as his other stuff, but this is only by comparison to Mistborn and SA. SA is my current favorite ongoing series, and I'd say Warbreaker is his best standalone. Malazan Book of the Fallen- I'd rate this the best completed big series. Easy to get lost at the start as you are literally dropped into the middle of a war with magic flying everywhere, but don't give up, it's the most complex and detailed world building I've ever seen. Can get a little introspective at times but overall excellent. Wheel of Time- Starts out awesome, gets bogged down in the middle, but then goes back to great. Quite an investment of time though, but still good. Sword of Truth- The first book is actually pretty good, don't let this fool you, it's a terrible series. First Law- Intentionally sets up a very generic fantasy plot in the first book. Then takes that plot out back, shoots it, burns it to ashes, and dances around laughing maniacally. VERY dark, but an excellent read if you are in the mood for it. Kingkiller- Very much journey before destination. Some people complain about his pacing, but I think Rothfuss tells a beautiful story, and his prose is well done.
