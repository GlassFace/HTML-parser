 I Did Not Get an Activation Email (Help! I can't post )
 A few accounts seem to have this issue from time to time. Recheck your email inbox for an activation email from the forum, also check your spam as it can sometimes get filtered. If there is no email, and you still cannot post in Introductions, please send a PM to Shian or any available moderator saying that you are unable to post. It may take up to 24 hours from the time of your PM to get your account activated. This is because an admin needs to put you in the correct usergroup.
