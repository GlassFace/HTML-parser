 Who cares about ol' D&D anymore?
 If you play D&D, or even if you don't play but know something about it, what is your favorite edition of D&D and why? Mine would be 1st edition tied with 3.5. 1st edition AD&D was very simple and had many great modules, like Temple of Elemental Evil and Queen of Spiders; however, I grew up on 3.5, and Icewind Dale II was based on 3rd edition rules... Also, have you ever played Icewind Dale, Icewind Dale II, Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II, Neverwinter Nights, Neverwinter Nights II, or Temple of Elemental Evil (PC)? If you have, which was your favorite and why? I liked Baldur's Gate II because it was a grand, epic adventure; however, I am still playing Baldur's Gate (original), so I can't be sure how it stacks up. Lastly, why do you think people don't play much D&D more? Why do things like WoW prevail? Where did all the single-player computer/video games go--the tough, classic ones like Wizardry? Why MMOs? 
 Not the Fighter, Cleric, Thief, Dwarf, and Elf from OD&D/AD&D. These are original inventions, not invented by Gary Gygax.
