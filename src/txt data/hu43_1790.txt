 I don't blame you, but sorry. I can't just like everyone who has a crush on me. That would be nearly impossible. However, welcome. Just try not to stalk me too much. 

 Yes, I do. I find human beings fascinating Welcome to A4, dear. See you around

 Welcome. I don't really like you since I don't really know you.No offence but,Your signature is sorta....disturbing.But,don't worry,kitty-cat. 

 Welcome to A4, nice to have you here. I'm sure you're going to be well known if you participate in many of the threads in the forum. Liked, on the other hand - some can't stand the pain of an individual being human and having opinions or views, others do. You could be notorious too. 
 
 what? Me love you long time? Welcome to A4

I know someone called Erin, she's a twin... are you a twin? because that would be weird... unless your the same person! I think we could get along, you seem to have cause enough of a stir in your intro. Lets see that carried over to the rest of the forum! P.S- Yes P.P.S-to your user name that is (assuming I can translate better than a 3rd grader) 
 Well, Maybe if I knew you better:P But that can change. So i'm in neutral territory at the moment^^ Welcome to A4! Enjoy the Forums.
