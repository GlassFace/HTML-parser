 video card error
 Every so often when I'm playing a game this happens to my screen: http://img41.imageshack.us/i/imgp1531h.jpg/ Is this likely caused by overheating? I haven't figured out if it happens after I've been playing for a while, or if it's when a lot of crap is happening on screen. It only occurs in some games though, mostly in Warhammer 40k Dawn Of War, right when I'm about to kick ass, of course.
