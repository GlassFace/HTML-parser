In Yokohama, the detective team Hamatora, formed by two minimum holders named Nice and Murasaki, comes across information connected to a serial killer being pursued by their old friend Art.

 The preview was interesting so I will watch it and people that liked blood lad will probably want to try and watch it as well.

I also loved most mystery anime I've watched, from Daughter of Twenty Faces to GoSick, to Un-Go, to Heaven's Memo Pad, to Dantalian no Shoka, to Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge, to Dog and Scissors, to Dangan Ronpa! Yes, I am quite sure I will love this anime!

 Episode 1 was kind of interesting I will stick with it because the fights when they use there powers are pretty interesting. 
  Spoiler 
 "The minimum- an extraordinary power beyond the understanding of man that manifests whenever a specific condition is met in the form of an action"........ Darker than Black anyone? 
 Hahaha and after all the fights and "Birthday" having his car get destroyed the goods in the safe...Porn. I like all the characters so far and I like the idea so I think I will stick with Hamatora.

Darker than Black anyone? Yes, very much Darker Than Black! I also get the feeling this might start giving off a Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge vibe in further episodes, with the darkness of the serial killer and the unique powers of the characters. This was not at all what I expected it to be (action rather than mystery), but it looks very good and I am very interested!

 Sounds interesting, and I like the art, so I think I'll give this one a watch when I get a chance. It also reminds me of Darker than Black. 
 I just watched the first episode and this is the type of show I will stick with. I love the powers and the characters are great. 
"I'll say it once more. I am the mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!"
 Oh my... that was quite creepy  Spoiler when you find out the guy Nice ran into was just taking one of his brains "out for a stroll". o_O

 Well I enjoying the series so far. Can't wait to see what is going to happen through out the show.

 This week's episode of Hamatora was simply brilliant! I can't wait to see where they continue to take this... it has such a Psycho-Pass feel to it right now!

 They mentioned the highest grade in the academy,  Spoiler and I had a feeling that Nice had it, but it makes things much more interesting. Except i wonder what is with Hajime, she was watching the video and was like "Oh i know this" but then its never brought up again, i am looking forward to see what she posses as a minimum holder or if she even is one at all.

They had alluded to his power before, and I'm pretty sure somebody had called him the most powerful.

 This episode was fantastic. Grandma  Spoiler driving that get away car was hilarious. It had its serious moments as well. Like when Moral shot "Beauty" in the head. I did not see that coming at all. Then as far as we know HE CUT OFF HIS HEAD!!!! Crazy. 

 Dont get too used to the show, its going to fall prey to the '12 episode super summary' curse which is unfortunate. They have already cut out alot of details about the characters to squeeze the anime into 12 episodes and expect more to come. 
 I was thinking last episode how much like Psycho-Pass this anime feels, but now that we see how similarly the main protagonist thinks to the villain, it's even more like Psycho-Pass!

 This scene is Gintama all over again, lol!

 I love this anime. She only saved that dudes life for the Free Buffet HAHA 

 I'm glad she has priorities.

 This last episode was intense. Im glad we got to learn some back stories. Curious about Art's brother. But then they fused the Yellow and Sky Blue I was loving it!

 Are you kidding me? Are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!!!???  Spoiler Not only does Art get the f'ing business but Moral tells him something and OF COURSE ITS THE SILENT SPEECH WTF?? Damn it I am so angry right now.
