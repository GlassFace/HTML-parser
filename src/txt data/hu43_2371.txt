 Steam trade?
 Hey everyone! Got Saints Row 2 over the weekend on Steam but unfortunately i cant get it to run on my laptop... So i was wondering if anyone would be willing to trade a similar game for it on Steam... That or if anyone could point me to someone who would be very interested in buying/trading for it...

 Would probably help if you posted the value of Saints Row 2. Anywho, what happens when you try running it?

 Oh, I thought this would be about Steam trading cards. Love those things.
