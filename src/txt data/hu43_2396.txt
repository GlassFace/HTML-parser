[Comedy] Bokura wa Minna Kawai-Sou (The Kawaii Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior)
 OMG Sora, once again we agree on something. I said it before and I'll say it again, the romance has deviated to just irritating drama where even the minor characters are useless and unfunny. The NTR bro and sis aren't really mean or nasty, but their introduction just derailed the entire light drama that had already existed within the plot. Usa and Kawai are ****ing idiots. 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils? Join Super-Powered and get in on the action! Â Spoiler http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...-Super-Powered
