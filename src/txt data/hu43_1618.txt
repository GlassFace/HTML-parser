[Comedy] Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun
 English Title: Monthly Girl Nozaki-kun (because Nozaki-kun writes for a Monthly Shoujo publication) Plot: High school student Chiyo Sakura has a crush on schoolmate Umetarou Nozaki, but when she confesses her love to him, he mistakes her for a fan and gives her an autograph. When she says that she always wants to be with him, he invites her to his house, but has her help on some drawings. Chiyo discovers that Nozaki is actually a renowned shoujo manga artist named Sakiko Yumeno, but agrees to be his assistant. As they work on his manga Let's Love~ (恋しよっ), they encounter other schoolmates who assist them or serve as inspirations for characters in the stories. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (月刊少女野崎くん) is an ongoing Japanese four-panel web romantic comedy manga written and illustrated by Izumi Tsubaki. Its chapters are serialized in Gangan Online, and published in tankoubon volumes by Square Enix. An anime television series adaptation by Dogakobo is scheduled to air from July 2014.
