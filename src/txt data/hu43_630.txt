 What Anime Characters Would Make For The Scariest Bed Time Stories
 We've all been through that point in life growing up as kids where we where told scary tales of the boogie man living in our closet or that there's a monster living under our bed making us want to leave the light on at night. If you where to tell a tale about a anime character which would be the most likely to give you nightmares? Alucard (Hellsing): pretty dang sacry and ruthless just imagine him releasing all restriction letting losse all the thousands of Souls he devoured walk the earth once more at his command. Hisoka (HXH): No one likes clowns or in this a case a freak nut of a magician just his face alone is enough to send kids runningLOL Saibamin (Dbz): Little green aliens that sprout from plants that shoot acid out of there head I think the discription is graphic enough and there already tons of nuts out there scared of being probed. Would be scared of those popping out of your next stoor neigbors yard or gardenXD Will be interested to see what others are mentioned should be interesting responses
