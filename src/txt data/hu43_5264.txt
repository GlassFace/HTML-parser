 Username Request
 If you wish to change your username please post in this thread. Post your current username and what you want it changed to. Please do not edit your posts here. If you need to change your username again then make a new post. I will gladly change your name again. We want to know the frequency of name change requests and we also want people to know who's who. Here is an example of what I want to see in a post. Example: My current name is Li Mu Bai and I want it to be Chosen. Something as simple as that. You don't need to bold but it does help if I'm tired. ^^ DO NOT EDIT YOUR POST. POST AGAIN IF YOU WANT IT CHANGED. edited by VL: There should be no comments in this thread. Any comments will be deleted.
