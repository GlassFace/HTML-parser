[Futuristic] Black Bullet - Page 11
 It wouldn't have had that pointless ****ing Love Triangle mini-arc. Dumbass teenage girl. What a stupid, silly little girl. I have no clue what the writers were doing having her crush on a man way more older than her, ruining the small comedic and romantic development Shiro was having with Akatsuki.

It was also unnecessary. One of the flaws of Log Horizon, a minor complaint at best but still irritating. 
 So any word on another season of black bullet?

 Be prepared, there's a lot of heavy stuff near the end. I think if there ever is a second season that it will go off on a bit of a tangent. Definitely a good show, will leave you wanting more. 

 It did things right, did things wrong! Honestly if there was a second season, I'd watch it. Some terrible drama was written bluntly into the plot, but the action and thematic substance was done well. An okay series, could have been much better. 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils? Join Super-Powered and get in on the action! Â Spoiler http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...-Super-Powered
