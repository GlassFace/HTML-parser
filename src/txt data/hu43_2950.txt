 What have you been drawing lately?
 Have a piece you've been working on for a while now? Got some character/thing that you've been drawing nonstop? Or do you just have a bunch of doodles to share? Post it here, and show off your latest work! It's getting a bit lonely in this part of the forum... I guess I should start.  Spoiler  Spoiler  Spoiler These past few days, I've only been drawing Neferpitou. Doing her hair was most fun I've had while drawing in months.
