 Perfume
 Was watching this episode of American dad. You know the Valentines day one! Anyway there was this super good song on it and when I went to look for it It turned out that it came from an actual artist called Perfume! Anyone here heard of them before and if so how long have you been listening to their stuff! Here is the song in case your wondering! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw_sm1uYZUA
