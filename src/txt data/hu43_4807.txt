[Anime] Anime that makes you think
 BOOYA for the start of a 3 day weekend, and thanks a lot for all the suggestions guys. I've got about 2 months left before I switch from winter mode(stay in and read books/watch anime) to summer mode(go out on my skiff, camp, hike, fish). This list should give me plenty of anime to watch over the last stretch till summer season. Now if you'll excuse me I'm gonna start my weekend with a lain marathon.
