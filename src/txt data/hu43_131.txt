 How often do you want to comment on closed topics?
 I think a lot of closed threads had a lot of potential but are locked before they could go anywhere. Now if the post is a worthless flame or obvious trolling or some inherent spam then by all means lock it but some threads (Very often by newly starting members) are like rose buds. Give them a chance and see whether they wither or grow before chopping it off. I've had many instances of wanting to comment on a thread only for it to be locked. Sometimes a new member is actually asking a considerable questions that if given a nudge could lead somewhere, yet five minutes after being posted, without any responses at all a mod closes it. Isn't that a bit harsh? I'd say a post which is not proposing some sort of list, or versus thread, or something silly like that, but is actually asking something and offering discussion it should be left for say 24 hours before action is taken. In a day's time you can determine whether it will degrade into a bunch of trolls under the bridge or has become a thread of value to the community. As for sticky's I guess it depends on what is it is about. Usually they are on vague topics which can cater to most people but I guess some users have only a limited interest in those threads and will only comment on so many of them before leaving them alone. I still visit them from time to time. Back to closed threads, I must say the idea Froid suggested of a poll was pretty clever. If not a general poll for all users, maybe just vetarans, or at least a poll of the mods themselves would suffice. That way moderators would not be able to be accused of abusing their power and opinion to close threads etc, because it would be a group decision.
