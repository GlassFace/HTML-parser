 Soul Cry Redone
 36; The Puppeteer (Revised Part 2)  Spoiler None of us are quite sure what to say or do, Rane has always been kind, and nice. We all wondered why she was always going to this section of the hospital and it appears this must be why. A small giggle leaves her mouth as she dashes for us, for me to be precise. I’m honestly too stunned to move as Erin jumps in the way, taking the full force of what we now see to be razor like claws on Rane’s right hand, emitting a blackish glow in the dimly light room. Blood begins to appear on his hospital gown as he leans into me while I hold him up. Jenny is just as shocked while I’m putrefied by Rane’s appearances, she looks like I do when I turn into a Black Rock. “To have someone weaker than yourself protecting you, you truly will be wonder full playmates.” She sneers. “Rane, why are you doing this,” Erin asks in a shaky voice while we both slump down to the ground, Erin being heavier than I though. I knew he would be in the way, I know this would happen, he doesn’t have to protect me, and I can handle myself. I think this to myself but I know I am in denial. Jenny draws forth her persona and tools, her blue jean short shorts and white hoodie with cat ears on the hood, a bat in hand she dashes for Rane, but she easily deflects the bat with that metal arm of hers. “I sensed a playmate that I haven’t played with in a long time, she was the perfect toy, always pushing me, always challenging me to my utmost limits. I grew tired of her and had my sister and I break her.” “My mother…” I question, forgetting about Erin in my arms and rising, “you are the person who killed my mother?” “Not literally, I was just telling my sister what to do. She’s one of my best toys, but I’ve been separated from her for a long time, I had almost forgotten who I was until a week ago.” She says while Jenny continually swings her bat and Rane dodges strike as if it were a passing breeze. She giggles again and my eyes begin to blur green, “is Eve your sister then,” I now say standing, and Erin struggles to speak behind me as I move forward, “you and Eve killed my mother and brother.” “Wasn’t it you who broke your brother?” She comments, now taking an offensive with Jenny and grabbing her bat, crushing the end in her hand and blasting her backwards into the chair she was just sitting in with her free hand. Jenny lets out a shriek while Rane looks back to me, “I never killed any of my toys, I just told my darling sister what to do. She’s incredibly persuasive.” Tears already welling in the corner of my eyes, I scream at her, while my Black Rock covers me, my eyes glowing green, my own left arm covered in black metal much like her hand. A claw forming while my black dress like blouse and black spats cover me. A crown of deep green spikes covers my head and my skin turns a slightly lighter shade. Zipping by her, I had already produce my chains which tail behind me and catch onto Rane as she gets slammed over the front desk, all the while laughing. “I feel her, I feel Marisa in you, and I felt her in that attack, she’s as playful as always!” Jumping onto the desk, Rane is on the ground, struggling with the chains, her eyes wide as I leap from the desk, arm forward and aiming for her face. But my hand stops as I see her own hand around my wrist. “It’s too bad she never played with you, you could have been a perfect toy for me such as she was.” I feel her hand tightening around my wrist and I drop to my knees because of the pain. She is breaking though my persona and she is actually hurting me, she is so much stronger. Wincing and struggling in pain, Jenny races over the desk after a yell comes from Erin, telling her to hurry. This time she lands a direct blow with her crushed bat. She hits Rane hard in the face, but she does not flinch, instead she steps to the side, my wrist still in hand as she takes her other and shreds my sleeve, revealing the glowing taint shard within my arm. Then in a swift movement that none of us are prepared for, Eve burst through the doors and I only have enough time to look over my shoulder as a searing pain surges though my left arm. The shard shattering by the strike and Rane pulling my arm. Blood splatters everywhere and Jenny stumbles backwards gasping. I’m gasping too as I fall forward watching as my left arm leaves my side yet remains in Rane’s hand. “Marisa, please show yourself, please play with me once again!” She drops my arm next to me as it jolts to life as if it were still attacked to me. I cannot utter a sound, I am too shocked and in too much pain to do anything. My eyes are wide as Eve and Rane watch my arm squirms and slowly grows into on a wispy form. A head forming from the bleakness as a sliver like pink smile appears before opening wide and screaming jarring my senses as I lie here. “Interesting,” Rane says, "so that is what she now is, a Banshee." But she turns on Rane instead of me, another tormenting scream and even Eve looks wary of this new creature—my mother. “How dare you.” Rane growls at my mother and throws a punch at her face, but she is so small, Rane has to jump. Only to herself get pinned to the wall behind us by Erin who has changed into the ghastly beast form of his, that Anubian. With Rane pinned to the wall by her neck, she struggles in Erin’s giant hand to get free. “Jenny, take care of Naomi!” He grows in a deeper voice than usual while Eve tries to charge only to be stopped by my mother who whips around on her, sending her back the way she came. But I do not see much beyond this as Jenny flips me over and tries carrying me away by my right arm, I have no left, but that shard in my shoulder shattered, there are blood drenched pieces all over the floor. They glisten in the glowing form of my mother as she comes at me, stopping Jenny who lets my hand slide out of hers because of all the blood that covered it. My Black Rock gear has already vanished and I am crying silent tears, unable to speak, unable to do anything. She screeches at me once again as I try to remain conscious during all of this. “Get off of Naomi!” I hear Jenny yells as she comes forward planting a foot next to my head and swinging her bat as hard as she can at the ghostly figures face. Her head merely bends backwards into an awkward position as focus my attention back on Jenny as her eyes turn from brown to pink. She is furious. And I am unable to do anything…is this what Erin felt like? Jenny remains standing behind me as the figure’s head comes forward again, and more tears pool to my eyes as within that whips I see my mother’s face, she seems to be herself. Or at least what I remember. Her own large blue eyes starting back at me, “you’ve grown,” she says in a somber tone. 1,309 Words 1,983 Words So Far This music is so good, sorry gotta post again XD
