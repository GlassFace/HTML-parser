Because nobody cares who writes or directs the Marvel Movies, because it's less about making a movie and more about marketing the larger franchise. There is no room for people like Edgar Wright who have a vision for movies like Ant Man, because that vision could be dangerous to the franchise, so it's best for them to just give it to a director who will put the studio notes first.
