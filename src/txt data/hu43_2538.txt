 What do people around you think about you watching anime ? - Page 2
 They simply don't understand. What it is confusing is France is the second consomer of manga, so it's pretty popular but here people think this word : WEEIIIRDO. Or rather childish. Violent. In other word : they don't consider you as normal. Truth to be told whn you see manga on french tv you want to yell. Because the quality of dub is poor, and it targets more the children. But it's like everything. Only people who are truly into the thing and know at least a little about it, can judge what it is good or not. So what do we care about other's opinion if they don't know a single thing of what is a anime? 
 Most people where I am like it or just don't give a f*ck about you watching it. Life's all about balances, you just gotta not be seen as "the anime kid". And a GREAT way to do that is to not spew cancerous Hetalia references all over the f*cking place like some sort of brainless sh*t-slinging monkey.

I wish there were a like button, because I'd press it until it broke. For real, though - as the Viewing Room director at a convention, you'd think I watch a lot of anime... but I don't. I don't tell anyone I watch it unless they're talking about it in a good light, or they ask... and even if they ask, I'm wary. It used to be that I would tell everyone, but I got a reputation several years ago, and it took forever to look "normal" again. #firstworldproblems 
 
 I don't watch anime besides Studio Ghibli films, but then who doesn't? My Japanese friends don't find it weird either if people really like anime. There's a lot of people from my high school and university who like anime and aren't made fun of because of it. I was teased a bit when I did, but generally no one really cares. I'm more worried about those guys at my school who love anime and only want to date Japanese or Asian girls in general... I do like reading manga, but even then it's only some series lately. My friends are mostly international students and a few watch anime a lot. Nothing weird about it. My best friend is Japanese and we love watching Ghibli films.

 Too Old to watch anime? Not Possible... I highly doubt everybody on here is a Teen, I'm sure most are adults. Anime is for who ever wants to watch it. What Do my friends and family think? Not to sure really, My Parents don't really mind. Never really asked my friends what they think to me watching it, one of them is always saying it's crap and 'gay'... :/ I don't really have any friends who watch anime like me. I have a friend who watches it, but no where near as much as me. TBH, I never see anyone near where I live wearing anything related to anime. So, I don't think it is that popular where I live... Most probably don't even know what it is. But for me, You watch anime? You are awesome! 
 Don't think anyone around me would mind, the only thing they would think it's weird is that it's in Japanese.

 Here's what people think in a nutshell: 
 White panties sure are cute, lol. 
 No one really watched anime in elementary or middle school so it was usually looked at as weird or unsafe, of all things XD I think it was just because they had never gotten into it themselves, along with having little interest. But in high school, there's a good amount of people who are going through their weeaboo phases, so usually they think it's a good thing My family doesn't really care meanwhile, they think it's just a bunch of animated girls with huge eyes and crazy hair saying "KAWAIIII" and "ARIGATOOUUU GOZAIMASSUUUUU" all the time but I don't find it offensive that much, they're not straight out insulting it 
 The rivals just got a lot sexier.
 People here would consider me weirdo in general. But I think its another form of entertainment just like movies, dramas.

 i told my 2 close friends i watch anime, they think it is strange but otherwise dont really care about it and just treat me like before. 
Understanding 100% of anything is impossible. Thats why we spend all our lives trying to understand the thinking of others. Thats what makes life so interesting. 
 I don't know what people think well one of my friends watches some anime, not all. I have another who watches Pokemon. I got one friend into a few Ghibli movies, but he doesn't watch other anime. Most people have watched anime movies or series, but they don't watch much. My friends and family know I watch anime, my work colleagues know no one takes the mick or anything.

 My co-workers think it's weird, but also don't really care. Most of my friends enjoy it like me. As far as my family; my sisters like it as well, my brother doesn't watch nor care that I like it, my dad doesn't care either, my mom wonders why I'm still watching 'cartoons'. Even though many of these 'cartoons' are definitely not for most children lol! I think once I had her watch Attack on Titan she finally understood though. =]

 I have no friends that are as interested in anime as i am *tears up* and a co-worker thinks thats its all about cosplaying, there all into marvel\DC stuff, guns/cars, magic:the gathering cards, old movies, and RPGs not to mention relationship drama i have to deal with im still looking for my local anime buddy/gal thats a little more than casual about watching something echi than just the really popular ones. But to answer the question there fine with it and watch with me sometimes(dont like it sometimes because i feel i have to restrict my emotions)well just as long as i dont show them things like "B gata H kei" or "Free" have to keep my respect. I am man hear me nya

Dude, come on. Have you not read the forum rules of advertising on A4? Please read our Rules and the list of legal anime streaming websites in our FAQ - Shannon Apple.
 For the most part, my friends know me as that anime guy, because I love it so much. My old roommate was always going WTF whenever he saw me playing Persona 4 Golden on my Vita. My friends grew up watching Dragon Ball and I introduced them to Fairy Tail. I live in an old mountain town now and the otaku's exist but are scattered. My parents still don't understand anime XD 
 Basically they think its crazy and perverted to watch anime, they have never seen one before so they made the idea up in there heads. Its kind of sad really. 

 Mixed reviews. Mostly ppl tell me "You haven't grown out of that yet?" Then I let them have it by stuffing my anime religion down their throats.....in the nicest way possible ^__^ Heehee

 My family doesn't have a problem with it, I even got a body pillow of Sebastian Michaelis and was like everybody look to my family and they just laughed and rolled their eyes but my bro likes anime too so no biggie with him, my friends however are a bit more eh about it so I don't talk to it with them much. 
 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses.

Couldnt agree more, Im only 20 so i cant really talk for the adult audience, but like most things, entertainment is for the sake of entertaining. Not all tastes are the same and no 'one' medium can satisfy all audiences.

 Thry think I'm weird and always say stuff like "Go watch ur bum cartoons" when we argue about stuff 

 When I was in grade school/early HS I was very quiet about my love for anime, but whenever it was revealed to someone I became one the those ****-spewing weeaboo disgusting fan geeks. I don't know how anyone tolerated me in that phase. As my love for anime has died down to an occasional binge watching, I just don't mention it to anyone. I don't think any of my friends would really mind, but there are so many misconceptions about anime fans that I really don't feel like denying (or... confirming)

 My family think anime is fine apart from that and a few other friends who does watch too. I normally won't mention it, either people having weird ideas or just believes is too childish for them. Its a shame as i would have liked to also discuss the coming story and episodes with friends more openly etc.
