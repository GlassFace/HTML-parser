Jinx with a Hurricane is stupid. Her long range Fish Bones missile splash is applied to the Hurricane shots. The damage really originates from his Q but yes he's pretty strong rolling both AD/TANK. Jinx's kit is really strong, But she has to play cautiously beings how she doesn't have escapes like several adc's..Graves,Vayne(R plus Q),Caitlyn,Twitch,Draven. Just my take on it and she has VERY slow move speed early so if you can capitalize on that I think you'll beat a Jinx Zap! is fairly easy to dodge. Personal opinion on Jinx i think they should fix her kit up a little bit. I would like to know what the nerfs going to be on her though because i know she's going to get nerfed. But I could be wrong about Jinx XD who knows, I don't lane much i only have like 200 games as a laner and 1050 in the jungle sooo... Dedicated Jungler i would say.

Jinx with a Hurricane is stupid. Her long range Fish Bones missile splash is applied to the Hurricane shots. That's because he's a bruiser, bruisers are meant to be tanky and damage dealer at the same time, look at Xin, build tank and you still destroy people, a lot, but after it gets boring. Speaking about Jinx, if they do, nerf her, it will not damage terms, more in range terms for her Zap! which is actually pretty long, but then again you can easily dodge it by moving to the sides, if she's far obviously, the rest is well balanced, her damage aren't too strong, on and on. 
A calm . mind is the key to success.
 Jinx has way too much utility for an adc. I expect at some point to see a range nerf on her w (and/or a huge AD scaling nerf -- it's at 140% right now), and some mana cost increases on her q active and e.

She' just like any other champion that riot has made. Overpowered for the first few weeks and then finds her niche a few weeks after the nerf.

On the other, that Ahri game, ew, I got, not wrecked, but beaten, there's no denying this. In the first 15 minute I was 2 and 1, but Jayce kept me from farming, yes jayce was mid, good thing he didn't head top, oh the nightmares, the rest was just me missing my Q's and E's in general, it was just bad, I planned on going Kayle, but the other guy took her and said any good mid and never called any so I just picked Ahri, should've went Kha'zix or garen, well anyways, I left booze 5 and I'm happy with my day, on a 4 win streak right now, might play some more tomorrow's afternoon or even tonight if I have the chance, I can at least, probably, reach silver, that would be good enough for me, I know I can't reach gold, that's like, 9 divisions away, so yeah, I know I can't reach that, I'm not Takera. And here, have this, I decided to counter myself against brand to give myself a great challenge, I sort of forgot this was Booze 5 so yeah, I wrecked him the first 20 minutes, then the teamfights went on and Vi took all the kills, she also took like, 2 of them from me in a gank, honestly, what ever, made us won so I really don't care, even though she was the jungler!

I could've been silver by now if I knew how the Ranked actually worked, I started bronze 1 and yeah, on and on, we're surrounded by good players, but what ever, I'm technically season 1, why technically? Like Takera knows, I had a lot of problems with my computers and well yeah, I was playing a week or so every month until the computer crashed for like, 4-5 months. Originally Posted by Takera_ Gratz :3 you have 20 more days to get silver Thank you and that's quite a lot of days to be honest, I guess, win 5 games in a row and get a promo everyday can make it go faster, doubt that will happen, but hey, winning 20-30 points a game if pretty neat! I was used to the good ol' win 3 lose 20, now it's the other way around, I won't argue with that. xD

Im pretty sure you it will probably be you, since I only play really on the weekends, but it would be fun nonetheless. Plus Im pretty sure we both will have our fill of trollers, Darius ks Dunkers, Horrible Junglers, No junglers at all, Afks, Feeding ragers who blame the team for their feeding, and the most notorious "First time (Insert Champ Name)." Gawd I hate solo ranked sometimes.

 @Dunn Yeah, we could do that, and I don't really get them anymore since I play during the morning, there aren't any of these 14 years old trolls trying to ruin your game badly. @BT Well thank you and of course none of us are, I just wanted to challenge myself, I guess this brand wasn't really... Smart.. @Pured It got moved back to november 11 I think, something near this number.

 RIOT's offered a glance at what they'll be changing in the pre and following season. http://www.surrenderat20.net/2013/10...ws-closer.html They're adding an additional jungle camp. That alone right there is pretty interesting. Of course there will be like a thousand changes so make sure you read that post I linked up there. 

 The change to vision will probably be the most significant. I'm looking forward to seeing more on that. The new jungle camp seems cool, possibly, and I think it's the first real addition they've made to SR in...ever? New carry jungle items could be nice, as Yi is still one of my favorite junglers and Aatrox is my next buy. By this I imagine they mean cheap carry items, but I'm sure they'll be difficult to balance due to the possibility of the items being too beneficial to laners as well (like spirit of the lizard elder). The change to snowballing could go either way, and I'm conflicted. Teams should be rewarded for doing better early (and for doing better in general, obv), and the losing team shouldn't be given some sort of handicap to make catching up easier, but...the game (or at the very least, the lane) also shouldn't be decided so easily in the majority of games within the first few minutes. Eh, I'll wait for more information on this. I'm sure it will be fine in the end.

 @Struggler, Idk man... I play mid and I hate snowballing... It pretty much gives the losing mid NO chance to come back... Then the losing team gets toxic and the losign mid cbf playing anymore. Most common matchup I find difficult is Leblanc vs Kassadin, I could snowball if I get level 4 before him... but if I can't snowball before lvl 6, Kassadin will **** on me and there is nothing I can do. I'd rather have a close game than a 1 sided game, they are always more fun. Support/ward changes? I'm interested.

 Jungle carry items? Hmmm, like struggler said they'll have to balance it so other lanes don't benefit from it, I don't want to see even more hard carries like Vayne and Singed to happen. But still, it would be a great idea since it is an important role and if lanes fail, the jungle can still be viable, if he's any good. On the other hand, if they do make good changes for the supports, then it'll make me even more happy since Jungle and Support are both my best roles in general.
