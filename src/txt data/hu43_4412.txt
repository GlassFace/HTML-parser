[Anime] Which is harder to recommend, a slow starting series or an abandoned one?
 So which type is harder for you to recommend to others? A slow starting series? Or A series that never got a resolution? I almost think a slow starting series is the hardest to recommend. If its wandering around in exposition and character development without advancing a story that can be a turnoff. I mean pacing is important. Sure you need backstories and relationship building but it has to be at a good pace. If it's not done just right you can lose an audience pretty fast. Series that never get a conclusion are also hard to whole heartedly recommend. My examples? Aesthetica of a rogue hero Great ecchi action but its incomplete. Still fun though, oh and btooom also. Glasslip This a good romance show but god it takes forever to start. It was like five shows about chickens for heavens sake! But I'm glad I stuck with it as it is good. Same goes for bodacious space pirates. Nothing really happens until the fifth or six show but its still fun. So which shortcoming gives you more trouble when you come up with a recommendation for some one?
