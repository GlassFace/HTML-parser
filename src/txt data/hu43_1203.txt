 saint seiya: who is your favourite character and cloth
 Bronze: Phoenix Ikki and Cygnus Hyoga Silver: Ophiuchus Shaina, Aquila Marin, and Lyra Orphee Gold: Mu, Aioria, Milo, Camus (I was born on the 7th of February,) and Shaka. Other: Kiki (he was just pure fun and absolutely lovable, I'm glad that he became the Aries gold saint in Omega.) 
The most badass anime character IMO!
