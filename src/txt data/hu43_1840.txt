 PETA Attacks Nintendo over Pokemon and Co
 http://features.peta.org/pokemon-red...e-parody-game/ seriously how ****ed up can they be doing such thing, i hope it gets shut down 
 Epic game! They should totally expand on it: Pokémon meets the real world. I would pay to see that made into a movie, even. Pokémon is a bit ironic like that. I would have to agree that it is difficult to believe that one can love Pokémon yet put them through such unnecessary battles. The kind of abuse portrayed by organizations, such as Team Rocket, is not really that much worse than regular training and battling. One would have to admit, catching Pokémon by beating them into submission is NOT a sign of love. While indeed not all Pokémon are caught this way, it does apply to the majority. Cannot blame PETA for protesting it. Let us face it, Pokémon is just a bit hypocritical. Nevertheless, if the Pokémon are cool with it after they are captured then, hey, there is no problem, right? It is the Pokémon world, not our world.

 Pokemon aren't animals, even if they were real. "Ash just battled and captured a Pokemon in this cartoon so Imma battle and capture my dog" PETA really can be ridiculous sometimes. 
 That game is actually kind of hilariously awesome. I always did think it was pretty weird that Pokemon, which demonstrate over and over again that they're sentient beings with their own wants and needs, are so routinely captured against their will and forced into combat with one another. I do remember that this kind of thing is was Ash wrestled with during the original anime's run, that he would often encounter abusive and terrible trainers and do everything he could to help their Pokemon. The Pokemon who do have healthy relationships with their owners seem happy enough, but the undertone of their relationship seemed me to be that Pokemon are kind of naturally submissive and if you treat them right they'll happily become your property and be your bestest bud. It's a pretty strange universe, especially when you consider that things like dog fighting are not just illegal but are reviled by most of society. If Pokemon were real it would probably be illegal to make them fight, too. 

 The antagonists in some of the recent games can actually be described as "Pokemon PETA" 
 LOL! The game is ****ing hilarious. I ****ing despise PETA, and if they were to spread their wisdom upon me in person, I would not even think about beating the **** out of them. A game is a game... A movie is a movie... A joke is a joke... GET THE **** OVER IT PETA!

 It has also crossed my mind a few times that Pokémon are in a way similar to animals and as they are captured, forced to train and engage in battles, it sort of mirrored animal abuse to me. In any case, PETA can be so cute at times. Also, I know this is kind of a dumb assumption, but how many actual real life animals have appeared in Pokémon related media?

GET THE **** OVER IT PETA! a game is a game and a movie is a movie eh.... then please explain to me why so many people out there on forums alone say they get many of their morals from the anime they watch if its just a tv show.  Spoiler weather you think about it or not, everything we see and do and read and watch and hear effects who we are be it in a small or big way ( tho i agree peta is going a bit far with pokemon) Most just cannot accept the fact that our personalities can be influenced by tv and movies and games because they do not wanna think of themselves as being controled or weak enough to not be who they are by their choice alone. But fact of the matter is many games and tv effect who we are in bigger ways then most realize that why it is important to control yourself and be aware of things and not pretend that things be it big or small do not affect you. 
 @Zenex, I understand your point there, but myself personally am not affected by such suggestions. Hence why I can be a dark person all for a joke, because I know it has no effect when I'm talking to people who understand that. Also... doesn't PETA's video show animal violence.... they themselves created animal abuse material.... Isn't that hypocritical despite it being for a protest?

Isn't that hypocritical despite it being for a protest? those who deny the affects of things around them on their personailty and views such as you just have are the one most taken in by it because you cant step back from it to see its effect on yourself and your remain oblivious to the changes it may have on you or even accept that it could. not saying that to be rude to you but it is true. as for the peta video that is something your grabbing at straws over. there is a massive difference between a video showing what really happens and glorifying something bad. Though i see what your trying to say its just not true. People need to see things in their true light to even accept they happen without that video its just one groups words vs another. one says they do bad things and the other says no we dont. Peole cant really make up a decision but seeing it for what it really is can change people opinion sbecause now there is proof. the things that truly effect people is when things are glorified for example look at one piece.. weather your realise it or not subconciously people are learning that pirates are good and the gov is evil which is not always the case but just a small example of a glorified moment that affects you be it in a good way or bad way it affects you because you likeit you buy into it and peoples views in this world are based on what they see,touch,hear,taste,smell our perception of reality is no more then that a perception based on whats around us... ianother example is sacrificial killings....some think it is wrong yet 100's of years ago it was considered ok and the only difference between now and then is what you see, hear and listen to about it....its said to be wrong so it is but reality is not that cut and dry but more of a majority opinion if today every decided murder was ok then it would be legal if today every decided weed was not bad then it to would be legal then the next generation would grow up saying murder and weed is good because that is what they would be taught by. parents,tv,music,teachers etc.. not any one thing will ever define a human being but its everything together that makes you who you are and yes some influences are bigger then others but an influence is still and influence. and some groups feel if an influence is bad and against what they belive it should not be allowed. which in itself i find wrong because who says you are right and can tell others how to live but again what is right and wrong is nothing more then an illusion granted by majority opinion. look at gay people. people say of being gay is ok becuase you do not choose your sexuality and to that i say oh reall well then is child molestation ok because those people did not choose their sexuality either so why is one right and one wrong...answer is because one can be accepted by the majority and the other cannot be but in reality their is no difference both are the same thing so is straight sexuality as no one chooses to be straight either but it is what it is and you are who you are. you also may say well gay is ok because both parties are consenting but what if a 13 year old girl consented to a 50 year old man does that make it ok ...if so why and why not. 
 ^*snrk* OT: This isn't really new. I'm not going to click the link (as apparently PETA get paid for their traffic; the more visits they get, the more money they get) but they released a similar thing when Black/White came out called Pokemon: Black & Blue. Fun game really, but the underlying message is completely off the mark, like most of their work.

 lol, that game is funnier than I imagined, but what PETA's problem with McDonald's? I doubt that they even serve much real meat. 

 I hate how people tend to b**ch about the stupidest things. Pokémon is a beast-master RPG. Its imaginary beasts and monsters that can fight. Unless I see your Yorkie firing off a Hyper Beam, don't worry about it. PETA should focus on animals that actually need help like stray pets instead of imaginary ones.

 PETA is just silly. I can se what they think, pokemon is teaching kids that forcing animals to fight is a good thing, but it's an argument that we've heard before and most of us know is just not true. Remember when mothers say and still complain "that videogames is teaching kids to be violent"? Same thing. There might be that one person who acts because of video games, but honestly, how often do you find a story about a person who tried to make his goldfish use horn attack against the neighbor's cat? PETA would have every human being be vegans anyway. They seem to fail to realize what goes into a healthy human being. I mean, don't they know that animals eat other animals? They are working to protect abused animals, that's fine. But I keep hearing story's that makes me think they want to make humans the bottom of the food chain.
