Seriously. Like. Come on. Dude. Seriously. Like. Really. Dude. Seriously. Like. Come on. The Question was, The Non Anime TV Show of the Year. Everybody knows the question refers to what show IN 2014. Not what show STARTED in 2014. You can not be this stupid. You have to be trolling. Please let us know that you are not this moronic, by just admitting that you mis-read or something. PLEASE.
