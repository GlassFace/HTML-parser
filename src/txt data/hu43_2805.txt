Wtf are you talking about Blizzard can just as easily squish the levels and put the level cap back to 60 or something around those parts. It's not as if they're going to sit there mouth breathing like idiots with no clue in the world what to do, and then simply give up on one of the key defining factors of an RPG. WoW has 10 million subscribers right now and it isn't like Blizzard is just going to give up on it because people have hit level 100.
