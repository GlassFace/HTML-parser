 Puush Ever needed to quickly upload a file or take a full and (or) sectional screenshot temporarily? Well this program will do it for you and automatically upload it to the web and then copy it to your clipboard. Rainmeter Ever wanted to watch an RSS feed of your favorite site easily? Or maybe you don't feel like opening up your task manager to watch the strain on your processor? Maybe you want to know your computer's temperature. Well this program is a desktop customizer and will show you what I mentioned above and more when customized correctly.
