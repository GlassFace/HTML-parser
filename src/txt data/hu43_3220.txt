 Jurassic World - Page 2
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFinNxS5KN4 So after years in development hell we are finally getting another Jurassic Park squeal/sort of reboot. I was seven when the original film came out and it scared the sh*t of me but I loved it. The second one was a bit of a let down but I don't think it deserves all the flak it gets, less said about the third one the better, I have high hopes for this film, I don't expect it to win any Oscars but if it can capture event half of the excitement, humor and tension of the first film I will be happy. Having said that looking at the trailer the dinosaurs are suffering very much from over reliance on GCI. It's a hard thing to admit but the creatures from the first film which is now over 20 years old look much better than those shown in the trailer. This is probably due to the mixture of traditional special effects along with CGI. Thoughts, opinions?
