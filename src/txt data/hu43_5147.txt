[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 I watched the first 2 and a half episodes and yeah, seems like a generic robot anime as written by Shadow Fox after dropping some acid. Think I'll watch the rest now seeing as I'm too shafted to go upstairs and watch JOJO.
