[Futuristic] Black Bullet
 In the year 2021, mankind was decimated by the epidemic of Gastrea, a parasitical virus, and is forced to live within Monoliths, which are created from Varanium: a metal that is able to subdue Gastrea. Soon, the "Cursed Children", children born with the Gastrea virus who are able to control it, which gives them superhuman abilities, are discovered. Due to the Gastrea virus' intervention, the Cursed Children could only be female. Civil Securities are formed to specialize fighting against Gastrea, operating with the pair of an Initiator, who are cursed children, and a Promoter, serving to lead the cursed children. Ten years after the epidemic, Rentarō Satomi, a high school student who is also a Promoter in his childhood friend Kisara Tendō's Tendō Civil Security, along with his Initiator Enju Aihara, receives a secret mission to prevent the Tokyo Area's destruction. An anime adaptation by Kinema Citrus was announced at Dengeki Bunko's Autumn Festival 2013 on October 6, 2013. PV

 Anime adaptation is expected for 2014... not for this winter season, unfortunately.

 I kinda read the manga before; I wonder how different the art would look in animation.

 New PV is here, featuring a song by Fripside!

 ^ Yeah, I was searching fripside on google and then I saw this. The OP they made for To Aru Kagaku no Railgun was pretty sick too.

 First episode was pretty cool! And Enju-chan....

 Was a good first episode. Aside from Enju being a little pushy I don't have any problems with the characters shown so far. Also digging the opening. :P 
 
 So far so good with this anime. The lab woman in the first episode is really hot and the main characters are pretty strong.

 Yes, lab woman was totally hot... though she has creepy tastes.

 The backstory sounds interesting but I'm wary of shows like this after watching the first episode of guilty crown. Might have to give it a shot and see.

 I must say, after episode 2 this show has skyrocketed up my list! It had all the feels...

 Show is epic. The dude in the mask is a straight up BOSS!!! (Side note) Anyone else have trouble getting on the site recently?

Big problems, as well as big posting errors when I finally did get on... but it seems they've cleared it up now. The order of some threads is still messed up, but new posts are now correctly bumping threads to the top of the forum... previously new posts were getting hidden because they wouldn't bump the thread or mark the thread as unread.

 This was quite an exciting episode of Black Bullet, with lots of interesting mysteries... That doctor is still hawt...  Spoiler I take it whatever "unforgivable" thing she did when she operated on him way back when has something to do with how he can survive multiple direct bullet wounds... I'm guessing he carries the Gastrea virus as well, like Kagetane (a product of the New Human Creation Plan) and the Cursed Children.

 I'm enjoying Black Bullet ~ heheh 
 
 Wow... this last episode had me teared right up! T_T  Spoiler 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 This show is pretty good. I really want to know more about the doctor. I think she could be the most interesting part of this anime. Well that and what the gastrea is. 
 Honestly, I'm a bit dissapointed with the latest episode. They didn't follow the manga, which was a huge letdown. The manga version of the battle with Hiruko Kagetane was far more intense, which would make the battle at least 2 episodes long. And I also felt that the pacing was too quick. Many important/emotional points just went by which made us didn't actually feel those scenes. If they had done this, it would earn them maybe at least another episode, bringing them to a total of at least 2.5 episodes for this battle. One episode just felt too quick. It's not dissapointing enough to make me drop this, but it somehow lowers my excitement for the upcoming episodes. I hope they would do better in the future.
