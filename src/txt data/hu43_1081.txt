 Read this before posting or risk getting infracted or banned.
 When posting about anime series, especially new episodes in particular, you MUST use spoiler tags or blackout texts. To do this, you can type [.spoiler]text here[/spoiler] or [.blackout]insert something[/blackout] without the periods. If you think someone is posting a spoiler, please either report the post or take it in PM. Don't post about it. Seriously guys, just because these materials have been released before doesn't mean people should already know.

 In addition, use the [spoiler] tag to post manga or light novel or visual novel or whatever source spoilers. The threads in this subforum are for currently airing anime series. If you'd like to discuss the source material, like the manga, then a thread about the manga is a better idea, but if there isn't one available then use the [spoiler] tag. If you want to discuss details of the latest episode use the [blackout] tag. Mentioning the source exists is fine obviously, but if you happened to have finished the manga which something is based off of and know what the ending is or what crucial plot details happen, don't be cruel and post them. You might not even be right, since anime adaptations pretty frequently diverge from the source material plotline, either due to alloted episodes or direction.
