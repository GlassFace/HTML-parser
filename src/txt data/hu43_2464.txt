 Instant Noodles
 ٩( ╹▿╹ )۶ What I do is I get a nice big bowl and layer the bottom with cabbage leaves. Then I cook the raman (usually Maruchan Beef because that's my favorite), adding a little pepper, and then pour it in. I like to add chopped carrots and sweet corn and maybe a salted boiled egg! I usually eat it when I want something soupy and salty, and not much effort. I boil it over the stove so there's not so much radiation from the microwave, so it tends to take a bit longer. （´ω｀）It tastes yummy though!
