[Anime] What do you think of harem anime?

I guess I don't hate ALL harem shows. Plus Black Lagoon is not offensive to women since all women in the show are complete badasses whereas all most of the guys are giant pussies.Which I guess makes it offensive to men? Or maybe mre to women due to sexualzation and such. Well anyway it's offensive to everyone regardless. And is it in style... Yeah I love black Lagoon. Call me a hyporcite. Black Lagoon and Steins Gate are not harems not even close to one...... also I watch reverse harems and they are just as bad, if not worse. This is probably because since they are not following the norm and making it a reverse harem, they are even more shameless about it. Also this my be surprising but at one point most manga writers in Japan were female that was when I looked it my have changed since then. Also in Japan its normal for everyone to read manga its not just a guy thing.
