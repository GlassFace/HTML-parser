 2pm new album!!!!!1 <3 links here!!!! <3
 ^ it was released a while back, they only just finished promotional tours of their lastest songs which is called ' Without you' from 'Don't stop can't stop' album, it's not better, it's basically them half naked rolling in mud, their best was heartbeat. It wasn't bad but felt cheesy and somewhat trashy. 
Thanks for the avatar Amoo :3
