 What do people around you think about you watching anime ?
 No one has ever cared in the last 15 years I've been watching this stuff. And they really never will. I don't talk about it at work outside the context of foreign films so no one really thinks anything of it. I talk about it with my friends and husband but they are into it so it's all good. My parents never really cared about anything I did.
