Personal Opinion: This anime was so freaking good, you don't even understand. I want to start by saying, no anime has ever made me laugh so hard. 2nd, this anime was incredibly animated, like nothing I've ever seen before. 3rd, the action scenes were spectacular. 4th, it was perfectly built. Let me explain 4th; until about episode 6/7 the episodes introduce every character and their backstory. It shows the best and worst of the characters and builds them like statues of perfection. Also, similar to Mondaiji-tachi ga isekai kara kuru sou desu yo, it has a great balance of action to drama to comedy to MAD-FREAKING-FEELS. As a matter of fact, they did this way better than Mondaiji. This series is similar to: Mondaiji-tachi ga isekai kara kuru sou desu yo, Clannad, Shakugan no Shana.
