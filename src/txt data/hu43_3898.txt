 ABC News does piece on video games, lulz are had
 Comparing Anita to actual feminists is something that some people do, but I don't like those comparisons. She's a sex-negative social critic who has made an (incomplete) series of videos with Jonathon McIntosh, a lunatic who believes that Tetris music is Soviet propaganda. She cites people who have been excommunicated from academic communities decades ago and is seemingly oblivious to this fact. Anybody fully invested in feminism would not be caught dead citing Dworkin after 1985. She's more of a really good publicist in my opinion. You have to admit, when it comes to publicizing herself, she's amazing. Her story is really good--middle upper class white woman getting attacked by horde of angry proto-school shooters? It's the exact kind of stuff that mainstream media loves to take off with. The story practically sells itself, and the mainstream media has high motivation to take it on because they compete with video games as a source of entertainment. It's kind of ironic that she's benefited this extensively by being a decent looking white woman when you think about it. Both men and women face harassment online, and as it turns out, men face more. Feminists despite their constant announcement that it's supposed to benefit both sexes seem overly concerned with the harassment women face though... I wonder why that is? I used to hate the term equality+. Now in certain brands of feminism it's just something I can't argue isn't the main goal.
