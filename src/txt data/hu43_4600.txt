 The new movie Dragon Ball Z "resurrection of freezer
 I haven't bothered to watch the movies that have been released after the series ended. I just feel like it's a lame attempt to keep the title alive. I assumed that the movies would be repetitve (moreso than the series) and just was not interested in them. I don't know if that makes me a bad person. ...Well, that's enough introspection for me today.
