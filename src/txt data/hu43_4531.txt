[Personal Life Discussions] A4, What is Your Favorite Alcohol?
 I've yet found anything better than Redd's. They make an 8% alc. and a 5%. I prefer the 5% one myself. Whiskey's are too strong for my taste. 
 It was only a matter of time... Now I am one with the night and stars again... Thank you, Rhyme's Law, for your signature art work.
