 Looking for Complex Animes
 Animes I've seen: Ergo Proxy jyu oh sei: Planet of the beast king No Game No Life Sword art online Claymore soul eater berserk I'm looking for something similar to jyu oh sei or no game no life where everything in the anime kinda feels new like youre experiencing it for the first time with the characters. Something interesting or complex where it makes you want to watch more, like the complexity in naruto where it explains the attacks and that sort of detail is nice. I find myself looking for something a little more complex after watching a lot of whats on crunchyroll. I'm also looking for anything worth watching that I might have missed movie or anime series. anything noteworthy any and all recommendations appreciated
