 Hahaha, wouldn't surprise me if that was real. And just watched highlights of the Aus/Holland game. I'd seen Cahills goal on the news but....gotdamn Australia really should've won this game! That chance at 2-2...shame as they put in a blood and guts performance against Chile as well. And no Timmy next game. ;.; Robben and RVP look like decent bets for golden boot winners.

 Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaant. I think the cameraman should've just concentrated on the crowd during the Iran/Nigeria game. That may be this WC's only 0-0 game!

 usa girls best girls. Lol at the red card for that cameroon player. 
 Honestly though the Netherlands match was too much for them. I never expected them to recover quickly anyway. Casillas will probably be flogged (verbally) once he gets home. His punch on the ball during Chile's second goal was weak to say the least. Croatia-Cameroon was the best sh1t. Apart from the scoreline, Song displaying some MMA and Cameroon players getting into a fight was pure gold. What the hell was Song even thinking?  Spoiler Originally Posted by Reclusive Habit Get ready for Sunday, when we annihilate them. It's the Group of Death, because we're in it. Oh, don't get your hopes up too much. Originally Posted by Oh Snap. . Obviously everyone is gonna be watching only one game tomorrow. Hope we can at least get a point and stay alive in the comp. That way I can get back to ridiculing Spanish and Portuguese people. I'll be expecting Uruguay to bite hard for the win. Its going to be a tough one for both sides.

 I love Cahil and all...great goal...but the foul on Indi made me lose a lot of respect for him. I'm all for a fair part of physical contact but this was way over the line. He should've been send of. Anyways, bad game on our end, but three points...next round...so far so good. Uruguay - England tonight! Don't you both let me down again! Looking forward to see Sterling and Suarez play 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 O we get to see Lugano the psychopath play, PLS KICK PEOPLE IN THE BALLS

As a religious follower of Major League Soccer, I'd like to see USMNT do well, but really what keeps me excited is the overall progression of soccer in America. This is arguably the best all around team we've ever had and a lot of that comes down to the average players level increasing. The future is looking bright. (10 out of 23 on the roster play in MLS, our best players all got their starts in MLS, and for the first time ever a lot of good players were left off the roster.) 
 Holy **** rofl. Not gonna lie, that extreme contact mma soccer gif is about the best soccer-related thing I have ever seen.

 Nice one Stevee G. Next time assist it to an English player... For some unknown reason some people suddenly think we have a chance if results go our way. Like....more so than before this game. Might be the heat. Anyway, I'm jumping on the Holland bandwagon as soon as its confirmed. People may lay off them if they don't finish bottom of the group which is looking very likely lol.
