 Ghost in the Shell Singer Origa Passes Away
 Voice actress Jenya reported on her official Twitter account that singer Origa (birth name Ol'ga Yakovleva) passed away on Saturday due to lung cancer. She was 44 years old. http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news...es-away/.83416 Very sad. First I believe they cast the wrong actress for the major in the live action movie, and now we lose the singer of the series. Very sad.
