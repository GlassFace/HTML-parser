 [Resources] The Visual Arts Resource Thread
 Visual Arts Resource Thread for all things VA We need an updated thread for resources since the old one is a little obselete. All mods who frequent VA should feel free to help upkeep this thread. I've included a number of online resources to help members find what they are looking for. If there is something that I haven't included here and the resources are FREE to use, (and the site isn't another anime forum) then please post it and we can add it to this list. I am reserving the second post here so we can put together a list of tutorial threads that have been created by A4 members. For Stock Images and Renders: Deviant Art (Resources section only - Do not use non-resource images from DA unless with artist's permission) Also has selection of brushes, textures, tutorials and other resources. 22 pixels Stock.xchng aethereality freedigitalphotos renders-graphics (please read individual requirements for free images before download.
