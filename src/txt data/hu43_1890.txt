[Anime] Yet another silly anime question.
 From time to time I see spirits portrayed wearing what looks like a piece of cord around their head with a triangular piece of cloth in the front. I think it may be related to some classic Japanese horror film or story about a ghost climbing out of a well. But more recently while watching Sankasea I also noticed that the hero's younger sister was wearing such a thing occasionally. What is it supposed to be? Also is that reference of the ghost climbing out of the well actually some classic story? That bit is just a guess on my part. 

 Think it's part of the burial garments they use, can't really find anything on them though so idk
