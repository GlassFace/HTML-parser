[General Discussion] Body Modification
 I have considered getting modifications. But I wouldn't get tattoos. Instead, I would get scarification. That is where they carve a design into your skin with a scalpel or razor blade and when it heals, it leaves a scar in the design you wanted. If I was to get that, I would want my inner forearms to be scarred. On my right arm, it would read ENVY and WRATH on my left arm. Essentially, envy flows in and wrath flows out. This speaks volumes about me. But I have never decided on it 100% so it is still in the air, so to speak. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
