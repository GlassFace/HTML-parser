 How Can We Improve The "Finding Anime" Sticky?
 The sticky in question can be found here: Anime-Forums.com > Anime General > Anime Chit-Chat > Finding Anime Names & General Anime Q&A Many users seem to overlook this sticky and create new threads in other sub-forums, which produces more clutter than we need frankly. Can you think of a way to help users find this sticky more successfully? Should we use a different approach altogether? Note that this sticky was made back in 2004.
