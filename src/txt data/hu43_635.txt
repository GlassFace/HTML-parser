 If you were a god... - Page 3
 Everyone talks about being a vampire, werewolf, alien, whatever. I personally would like to be a god, Immortality, unlimited powers, and no negative personal consequences for my actions. So with the powers of any god in anime, what would you do? Personally I'd do the "I grant you one wish and see how it goes" deal. Maybe make some magical items and spread them around. You know, just enjoy it. Naturally I'd keep it ont he downlow though like most gods these days. Humans can get creepy with the worship, sort of like with rock stars. It's cool when they build shrines and offer up tribute, but when they start begging for everything and tearing their own hearts out, it's time to go into hiding.
