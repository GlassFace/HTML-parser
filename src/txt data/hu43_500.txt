[OOC] Glass Academy for Inhuman Beings - Page 87
 Lol, this is going to be fun trying to find places for Raph to fit in. it should be... fun 
 I thought his name was Ralph. With an L. Keki, my apologies. My thoughts exactly Force. Okay, so looks like I have support for this, so now it comes to thinking up a scenario for what might bring our characters together. Any one have a preference. Also, it might just be all females for this storyline, and Ra(l)ph. 
  Spoiler 
 well his full name is Raphael, so there is an L, just at the end 
 Well I feel silly now for not noticing that sooner... 
  Spoiler 
 so whats going on with the new story/thing for this RP forums 
 Code: Anime-Planet.com - anime | manga | reviews this is my signature there are many like it but this one is mine 
 Hey guys, Sorry for being gone so long. Force, you were right, i was hit with mid terms, and I pretty much LIVE in the library, it's like my second home lol. I'm truly sorry guys for keeping you guys waiting. I can totally understand if you guys want to make a new story line, because my absence has caused a steady halt within the rp. For me, things have calmed down, in terms of school work. I still have some tests coming up, but I've passed the busy busy period, where everything was all due in the same week, and i had like 3 mid terms in the same week, day after day. Randoms, you are so great for keeping things up, I wouldn't have been able to hold up the rp without you. You're the best GM ever. And thank you to everyone else for your patience. Now I'm all fine and good with continuing the current story line, since I'll be here then, but it's really up to you guys. 

 Well, now I'm conflicted. Do we wait for Danny and her post, or do we make the other storyline? Just to clear something up Danny, we were not going to abandon the other storyline, the one with Hucklebee and Prom, but rather make another storyline to use along side it until such a time came as to merge them back together. 
  Spoiler 
 why dont we just run 2 storys ? yes it wuld be complecated to do but it would solve both issues 
 I think we should keep on the track we're going for the rp, but a new arc with the un-used characters would make sense.... There isn't really a good way to introduce so many characters back to back. 
 So then I guess it probably falls on me to make this under arc for unused and new characters then. 
  Spoiler 
 Not quite sure yet. Will help out with things in probably a couple days... Having some issues right now. 
If we make it back to the real world. Ill find you again. And fall in love with you again.~Asuna, SAO "Lets accept each others weak points; love that touches one another is invincible; we who bloom are the protagonists" ~Tamaki, OHSHC' Thanks so Much to Takera for the siggy! 
 Ahh I see randoms. Ok, then I'll rework on my post again. I don't mind having two story lines going at once, as long as everyone is sure they want to start one. Because once we start, we'll have to stick with it and continue it. I don think it's a good way to introduce characters, but it well be a commitment. If we're all good, I'm fine with it. 

 Danny, why must you leave us in suspense? Also I made a post for what I will call the "Introductory Arc" for our new characters and unused characters if you guys want to use. It is focused on Elisabeth. 
  Spoiler 
 I'll start working on my post now. It'll probably be up in a few days. Message me if it's not up by Thursday and I'll get it done. 
 I'm not really sure on what I should be doing... 
 You know. I am not so sure either. Your character is with Danny's right? It appears you are tied up until she posts. Maybe you could make another character or a temporary character? 
  Spoiler 
 I'd rather stick to one character, but if need be, I can look into making another for the time being... 
 It's up to you. You can take control of a teacher or something so you can interact. A temp character. 
  Spoiler 
 Ready whenever you all are. Just a tad bit confused on what is all going on with this. 
If we make it back to the real world. Ill find you again. And fall in love with you again.~Asuna, SAO "Lets accept each others weak points; love that touches one another is invincible; we who bloom are the protagonists" ~Tamaki, OHSHC' Thanks so Much to Takera for the siggy! 
 Personally, I'd like to continue my end, but I don't really know what to do there. I'm not really sure what Danny's planning.
