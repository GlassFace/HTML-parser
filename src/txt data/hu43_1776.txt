 I can't really narrow my choices to just a single girl or even a handful of them, but I guess what I find attractive in a female anime character is more or less the same as what I find attractive in a real woman: a girl who takes care of herself and has an eccentric side to her. A few examples would be Yuki Nagato (despite being seemingly emotionless, she has cute moments and is an otaku), Noel Vermillion (her personality is just too cute and the moments of eccentricity just enhance her appeal), Orihime Inoue (friendly and has moments where she seems like a real oddball), and Mirajane Strauss (she seems so calm and serene, yet she has a devious side to her).

 I still don't see how Yuno is attractive in any way. Also, Usui Takumi is definitely the most attractive guy. You can't disagree on that. 
 The world's not perfect, but it's there for us, trying the best it can. That's what makes it so damn beautiful. -Roy Mustang Member of Individual Eleven ​
 Dark/Black Magician Girl from Yu Gi Oh! is popular one, and I agree that she is attractive. ^^
