 Skyrim, and What I Think of It (Not a Formal Review)
 SKYRIM!!!! awesome game i play it all the time really the setting and the graphics are fascinating and the game gets pretty addictive afterwards i like how your choices effect how you proceed with the game. i know alt of games do this but the best feature in this game is the 1st person view. its the best rpg game i have played personally...
