[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 I'm only 2 episodes into this but I have to say I really enjoy it so far. Haruto (i think thats his name) is such an interesting character because he comes off as a useless kind of person, similar to many shounen lead characters, but is actually a lot smarter than he leads on. He loses the eating contest on purpose, doesnt tell shoko he likes her, and he does these things with much thought put into them and has much higher motives than what is on the surface. I really love this anime so far for the main character because he is really a different kind of lead seen in many manga.
