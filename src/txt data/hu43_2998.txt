[Action] OreTwi (Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu. / Gonna be the Twin-Tails!!)
 Sōji Mitsuka is an ordinary high school boy who has an obsession for twintail hair. One day, he encounters a mysterious girl named Thouars from a parallel world when monsters appear in his town who declare that all twintails in the world belong to them. These monsters feed off the "attribute power," the spiritual energy of humans. Thouars entrusted Sōji with Tail Gear, imaginary armor initiated by powerful twintail attributes. With the armor, Sōji transforms into Tail Red, a twintail warrior girl (ツインテイルズ関係者, tsuinteiruzu kankei-sha), to protect Earth. Gonna be the Twin-Tails!! (俺、ツインテールになります。), also known as Ore, Twintail ni Narimasu. or in its short form OreTwi (俺ツイ), is a Japanese light novel series written by Yume Mizusawa and illustrated by Ayumu Kasuga. Shogakukan has published five volumes under their Gagaga Bunko imprint since June 2012. An anime adaptation produced by Production IMS will begin airing in Japan in October 2014.
