 What are you currently Playing?
 Recently bought Hyper Dimensional Neptunia: ReBirth on Steam and I have to say it's not as much of a cake walk as I expected it to be. And it's not nearly as ecchi driven as one would think. I almost didn't get to play it but, somehow my older laptop met the criteria needed to do so. It was on sale for $14.99 how could I say no? So far, Pros: Cute bright characters and style, graphics are rich and clean, nice comedic relief that is great for hardcore gamers, actually rather challenging. Cons: Enemies are pretty poorly done, battles can be very long, World map type of menu rather than moving around place to place. (Personal dislike I enjoy traveling in games )
