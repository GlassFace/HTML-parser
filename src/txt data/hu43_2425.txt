[Mecha] Break Blade (aka Broken Blade)
 The story is centered around a young man named Rygart Arrow, a resident of a world where people can use "magic". This magic is the ability to control and empower quartz, doing many things from creating light to operating machinery to riding giant mecha called 'Golems'. Rygart, however, is one of the few exceptions; as an "un-sorcerer", he cannot utilize quartz, making many aspects of life difficult as well as being looked down upon by the rest of society. Despite this, in his youth he managed to befriend Hodr and Sigyn, the future King and Queen of the Krisna Kingdom; and Zess, the younger brother of the Secretary of War of the Athens Commonwealth. Years later, Rygart is reunited with Hodr and Sigyn where he learns the Athens Commonwealth has begun an invasion of Krisna. Rygart is also shocked to learn that Zess is leading one of the strike forces. While at the capital, Rygart discovers that he has the ability to pilot a recently discovered ancient Golem which cannot be piloted by magic users. Despite its ancient origins, the golem possesses capabilities and systems far more advanced than the current Golems, and could be key to turning the tide of battle. While hesitant at first, Rygart soon gets involved in the war between Krisna and Athens, in an attempt to save Hodr, Sigyn, and Zess.

 Sounds like something I would watch...is it possible that it's only a 6 episode run? 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 The anime feels so much like Escaflowne its scary. It has the nostalgia feel to it, like a 90's anime. Definitely a must watch. Also the anime is 12 episodes long, according to its wiki, and has 6 films tied to it. Apparenntly the 6 films will be made into a 12 episode anime.

 While looking this anime up, I can confirm that there's a series of Movies this anime is essentially a remake of. Now the question is I watch the movies or not? I learned that this anime may have added scenes not in the movies. 
 Â Spoiler 
 I haven't watched the movies, and wholeheartedly dived into the remake. My god, it's amazing. The drama and action is spectacular, I seriously love it. The underdog element and hidden feelings, as well as politics are great themes in the plot. Watch this. After Ep 5 Edit: OH SHYET SON. That amazing claymore jump! And then...don't want to spoil anything. How could they end the episode right there?! There's so many things which make the plot awesome, but one major contribution if the factor involving the facts which others don't know about the characters and how they have developed. SUCH AN AMAZING SHOW

 Ah hah ha! Epic save, bird. I like how information is revealing itself despite all the dramatic irony. Love those realizations. Also, I have a feeling Zess lost his legs or something...will he hold a grudge? I think so, but **** I dont want that. Also, the light ecchii! :O After the latest ep: Yeah, **** those Athenians Rygart, you've got the ghost of Sparta with you. Then show them your balls, or at least try to when the Queen who's crushing on you hard isn't around. Also...oh man, a great General has fallen. I liked the Super Sentai/Power Ranger colorful mech squad at the end tho, lol. I like the minimal fanservice, I appreciate that small type of stuff. Girge is...odd, and his history is cool (which includes his filial ties). Oh btw THIS ANIME IS SO ****ING GOOD

 Woah...the Generals are awesome, I just...damn man, I love the Golem battles its almost like Ancient Rome but with Mechs and firearms. Rygart is a really cool protagonist, I really like his backstory and development. I like how the Delphine (what a shitty name for an awesome mech) has a handicap, so he can't be a perfect hero. Ahaha, dat ass doe! Holy **** Girge...you ****ing incredible monster! Damn I'm glad you're a good guy...I think. So after episode nine: That's how they end it?! **** you Girge, you lovable douchebag. I love the bullshit mech accuracy and musical scores, as well as the DRAMA. So after that boss episode 10: OH. OH JESUS. Girge you're a ****ing beast, platinum goddamn chimera! What did you say man, what did you say?! The squad is getting ****ed up man, I am so hard for the next episode!

 NYOOOOOOOOOOOOO. YEEESSSSSS. All this build-up, this fantastic causality. Such a great ****ing episode. Oh my lord, I need to recuperate for a moment. 
 People are saying the movies are ultimately more better than the anime, but I feel that this series did a great job at creating a dramatic plot and strong characters in the amount of time it had. Awesome anime, really damn amazing with the action and drama. Although the story may be just a bit generic or cliche, I totally overlooked that insignificant base element and was enthralled in all the unique things it did. I mean, Valvrave was cliche as **** but it was awesome.
