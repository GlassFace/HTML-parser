[Anime] What was the first anime you ever watched?
 I remember watching Crayon Shin chan back then I didn't know there was anime 
 Before I knew what anime was, it'd be Cardcaptors/Cardcaptor Sakura. Once I knew what anime was, it'd be Mahou Senshi Riui. 
 I don't really know, I have vague memories of watching Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Yu Yu Hakusho and Neon Genesis Evengelion (Had a toy of the Purple Evangelion) with my brother when I was really young. No idea which came first though but it's one of those four 
 After searching up on google nostalgia flooded right in. I think I watched Tokyo mew mew after Crayon shin chan. 
 Yu yu hakusho or DBZ. Not sure which one but I used to go insane when these shows were on 
 Pokémon, but back then I didn't know that was anime. When I knew what anime was, I watched Fairy Tail but dropped it. So the first anime I actually liked was Fruits Basket.

 Sailor moon was the first anime i ever watched though i didn't know it at the time. Once i knew what anime was the first one i watched was digimon

  Spoiler  Spoiler 
 the first anime I watched was some weird sci fi one called mahoromatic, I don't remember much of it, just it had alot of ecchi 

 Dragon Ball Z , however I didn't really know what anime was until like two years ago after watching Rurouni Kenshin. So even though Dragon Ball Z is the first I ever watched I consider RK to be the first anime I ever watched. 
 hmm its actually kinda hard to say since when i was a kid there really was no difference between cartoons and anime so i could have watched some before i knew what it was but if i had to guess i would say sailor moon because i use to watch it in the morning b4 school right after magic school bus haha 
 I remember watching Naruto and Pokemon like every other child at that age but at that time i didnt know what is anime but now i know and its a wonderful part of my life ^.^ 

 Technically I watched a few episodes of Speed Racer when it was first released in the US. I also watched Pokemon with my stepson when he was young. But in both those cases I wasn't really considering them as anime. They were just something that was on TV. The first series I actually watched when looking for anime was Slayers. 

 Fruits Basket! Was my first! 
 The one I didn't know was an anime at first was Naruto... yeah I'm pretty sure that was it.

Do you know whats the difference between a king and his horse? INSTINCT!!! Hollow Ichigo (Bleach) 
 The very first anime that I've ever watch is an anime called "Yaiba". It's about the adventures of a samurai kid named Yaiba who's very skilled with lightning-like samurai techniques. I can't remember all the details but I recall that it's quite good.

 Lol Dragon Ball Z 
 
 Cardcaptors!! (a.k.a. dubbed Cardcaptor Sakura) 
 I'm pretty sure it was Great Teacher Onizuka. Its the first series I really searched for.

 I don't know if Pokemon counts but that was my first. 
 The original Dragon Ball... I'm feeling nostalgic now 

 Well I didn't know it was referred to as "Anime" at the time, but my first anime that I watched was probably, Pokémon, when I was about 5-6 years old.

 I remembered watching Tokyo mew mew and I always think "What on earth are they doing" 
 My first few anime (IDK what i watched first) would've been: Cardcaptor Sakura Pokemon One Piece DBZ Digimon 
Watch It!!! Or I'll Take Your Soul 
 The first REAL anime I saw was Ghost In The Shell and it left me awed.
