 Highschool DxD Manga?
 Before you read any of this I want to apologize if this is the wrong place to post this question since highschool dxd fits under like 15 genres. I think it's more of a horror so I've decided to post it here :3. So I've been a long time fan of the anime Highschool dxd. Recently I was bored and I re-watched an episode from season one. I've NEVER re-read or re-watched any kind of book, tv show (except Spongebob lol), or movie. I just think it's boring and I already know what''s going to happen. Highschool dxd however was a nice thing to watch for all the action and comedy it brings. Since re-watching the anime is still kinda boring and I want to know what happens next in the story, I'm wondering if the manga is worth reading (Also a season 3 may or may not happen. I believe it is happening but it may take a while. On top of that it might not even finish the story). If any of you have read the manga could you suggest what chapter I start on. Or should I just start from the beginning since I haven't watched the anime in a long time? Anyway any advice is well appreciated, thanks.
