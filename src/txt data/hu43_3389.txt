 Which cheesy movies do you like and why?
 Good job I watched this with friends dubbed (my pick) and despite most of them being turned off by gore they were all laughing their asses off. Watched it again in original language and it plays out like a really intense, overly violent and very disturbing horror action flick. Also good but not as epic imo. Another excellent kung-fu/comedy (guess Ricky would be unintentionally hilarious but w/e) is teh Mr Vampire Franchise. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqFCTofqh1o I remember them being awesome so don't come crying to me if they suck lol. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro?
