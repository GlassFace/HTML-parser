[Event] [Round 5: Double header] A4's Greatest Anti-hero: Jellz vs. Zoltor
 If our prime candidates for villainy are showing their faces, it should be no surprise that the anti-heroes still have a few aces up their sleeves. In our first corner, we have a native to the Bronx, someone who despises girls who kicks puppies (Nessa), and looks to crush all those in his way; Jellz. Blunt and to the point, he makes no qualms about hurt feelings, and will often balk at the weakness of your tears. Doesnt sound like an anti-hero to you? Thats too bad, the nomination has already been cast. When hes not playing Madden 15, or dunking his basketball over little Somali kids, hes keeping the streets save for New York, a clear contention in the licensing properties that would allow himself and The Archangel to live in, and protect the same city. But **** happens, and Jellz is going to sweep up crimes, while taking on the occasional bribe; but only if its Ippo, or a pair of shoes and a hat. Or hell, money in general. In our second corner, we have an illustrious fighter whom no one takes any pride in knowing; Zoltor. This anti-hero will fight for what he believes till the bitter end. Inuyasha is the greatest anime of all time, he proclaims, and is quite willing to die for that belief; which Im willing to bet Jellz would be willing to hand him soundly without a fuss. A big fan of Elfen Lied, Zoltor has nothing to hide from the world; including the shame he should have for those anime mentioned before. But hell fight his way through and persevere. A vote for Zoltor is a vote for Inuyasha and Elfen Lied. Dont let these anime fade into obscurity with their biggest fan; Zoltor. Nothing else to add. BEGIN! 
Individual Eleven: Rise Up. Never conform. 
 Down with InuYasha and Elfen Lied! xD

 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses. Beside you as you like softly down, I will be until I hear the words "Checkmate". ~Sebastian Michaelis ~ Individual 4 ~ A4's Greatest Villain <Right Here Lmao
