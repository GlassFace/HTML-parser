[IC] Memento Mori: The Circle
 After 5 days of continuous travelling, Marco finally arrived at Ophelia Village. He only just remembered about the Festival of Fae was happening in the village. "This event always bores me." Marco said to himself "But at least it's peaceful inside, as well as the party-ish atmosphere in certain places". Marco walked down the main street looking at all the houses and shops around him. Marco stopped at a large oak tree and sat down under it, and brought out a medium-sized leather journal, and a small pen and wrote down all the feelings and thoughts he had in his mind at the time. He looked up, and around the area once more, packed up his bags once more and headed off to find an inn.
