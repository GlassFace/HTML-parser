 Suicide Squad (2016)
 "A secret government agency recruits imprisoned supervillains to execute dangerous black ops missions in exchange for clemency." There isn't really a great deal released on the plot besides hints that it'll follow in some ways the story of Assault on Arkham (2014) So, is anyone looking forward to the upcoming movie Suicide Squad? I'm honestly ecstatic, a movie focusing a lot more on Harley Quinn and Deadshot? Yes. Not only that, Margot Robbie is playing as Harley, please tell me i'm not the only one excited about that (for those of you who don't know who she is, she's the chick from wolf of wallstreet). Not so keen on Will smith playing deadshot though, eh and mixed feelings with Jared Leto as the Joker, can only really picture him as angel face but whatever, I truly do hope they'll prove me wrong. imdb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386697/
