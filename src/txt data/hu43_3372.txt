 A4 Has a New Owner!
 The Facebook group isn't new. It's always been there. Sadly, over the years, people left it. Well most of them don't post here anymore The new owner would like to see it revived though which is why there's a link to it on A4 again. 
 Do you RP, or are you interested in learning? Join our Role Player's Society here on A4. Would you like a baseball bat to shove up your ass along with that stick? You're a mod, please act like one A4 is on FACEBOOK
