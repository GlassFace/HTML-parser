 Yeah, I know you guys are right... I still stand by my original statement though. 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EXQ1aF-bm0 "Love's Sorrow" by Kreisler. It's kind of a simple little violin waltz. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efaF8wZj5eY And the Rachmaninoff transcription to piano. To be honest, I like the violin version better. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cZNWZiDwJg And "Love's Joy" by Kreisler. for kicks.

 That ending of episode 14...got me all teary eyed. Edit: WHO WAS  Spoiler THAT BLONDE CHICK WHO SEEMS TO HAVE FALLEN INTO KOUSEI'S LAP!!!!??? 

 Omg!!!!!! This is too cute!!!!! The first episode is great! The girls look a lot like the ones in ao haru ride only younger. The animation style I mean. Is it the same studio? Some of the comedy bits are similar to monthly girl, albeit toned down. I will enjoy this for sure. Though kousei sure has a past doesn't he? Ill enjoy watching this one. Don't know when I'll catch up though.

 I watched episode 14 the other day.  Spoiler The girl is definitely going to die. 
 God I dislike Tsubaki's character more and more. LOL when Kousei ran up to Tsubaki and began to shaking her. Oh boy, he just dropped a bomb on her. Look at those massively unrealistic tears, though. Looks like Tsubaki's little 14-year old heart just exploded with feels.

 I finally caught up!!!!! Oh man I was definitely tearing up there at the end of fourteen. I didn't cry but I was certainly misty. The metaphorical connection between kao and kousei's mom is incredible. It didn't hit me until I saw that scene when kao  Spoiler had all those pills just like his mom did This show is really something special. I've marathoned it the last few days. I've even stayed up later the last couple nights to squeeze in just one more show. Holy crap this has been a good ride. I

Think so. That end of episode 2 is the big one. Just before that Watari was telling him something like "whether or not it's impossible, the girl will let you know" too. He wound up getting promoted I think. Although if we're drawing parallels between Kaori and Kousei's mom then kousei's mom  Spoiler misled him into thinking his piano success would help her recover and kaori is  Spoiler clearly hiding her illness from everyone So it kind of makes Watari's advice to Kousei cloudy.

 Wow...that ending left me...wow. So now it seems  Spoiler paralysis has set in for some reason. Kaori and her wobbly legs. Kousei is going to be  Spoiler teaching blonde hair girl, who her brother is probably that other blonde haired dude. And Tsubaki SUCKS! Just admit you're feeling already damn it! Also so many crazy events happening to these kids who are only...what 13? 14 years old? This S*** is rough yeah? 

 I love this anime!! music is great!! op is nice!!!

Your point makes more sense. 
http://myanimelist.net/animelist/yoda313 
 Tsubaki was the one harping about change and growing, yet she's the one suffering the most and trying to keep things like they were...damn she's annoying - but that just goes to show that the writers know what they're doing with her development. Anime logic = **** the glasses, they get in the way of the eyes. Now there's a loli, like one that apparently matters or something, in the plot? That ending was so thrilling, I am SO CONCERNED for Blondie - oh **** man, she's one of the best ****ing characters. The romantic drama though, it's such a harsh triangle. LOL someone was like "Why is this not called 'Your Feels in April'?"

 You know, Blondie's parents are bakers like the parents from Clannad too, aren't they?

 Okay.. please tell me someone else out there cracks up every time they say "shimphony" in the second intro song? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smX_6YEAc7c I like the song but that first shimphony cracks me up every time. 
 I just finished Episode 16 and all I have to say is...  Spoiler DUDE WTF?!? This show is going to get a whole lot darker before things get better... Also, Sora Senpai you totally nailed it on the little blonde hair girl. Good call there. 
 Yeah David wtf????? Kaori is turning into hitoe from wixoss only more so. The writers just want to  Spoiler pile on the hurt over kaori. And what the hell kind of ending is that? Don't read this next spoiler until you finished it  Spoiler do you want to commit double suicide?????? That's one hell of a way to ask someone to go on a date with you! And  Spoiler I thought kousei might actually have been dreaming when he saw kao. And I knew something was up when kao dropped that water bottle.

 It better not turn into a f*cking school days cause that's going to piss me off. Right now I'm between wanting to watch the anime because it's good, and not wanting for fear it might piss me off.

 If Kaori  Spoiler makes it out alive at the end of this show I'll be upset. You're waving the death flag since...pretty much the beginning, FINISH THE JOB. I really would like to see how this story plays out I do not  Spoiler want any double suicides but Kaori dying makes more sense then Kaori living. I have a feeling that she'll live because he already got over the obstacle of losing someone important to him, an I just don't see him losing another important person the same way his mother died. 

 Seriously, the romance locks me between two choices that I have equal admiration for, it's a really though choice to choose who would fit Kousei better as a lover! Nagi, that little conniving loli *****, is still an annoying and meddling character. Props to those who drew the parallels between the medical dilemmas of Kousei's mother and Blondie early on. That ending, although it was a quote, was still a bit of a mild jolt at my anxiety! I'm so hooked to this series. AVOID SPOILERS THEY ARE ****ING EVERYWHERE I hope no one in this thread, including me, gets spoiled on this series...that would just be damn terrible, a lot of people have already said that its one of the worst things to happen to them, or one of the worst decisions that ever happened (getting spoiled or spoiling themselves).
