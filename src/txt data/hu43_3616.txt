 A4 Awards 2014
 Welcome to the 8th Annual A4 Awards. (2014) Looking back over the entire year January - December 2014, you are asked to nominate members, threads and events under the following categories. You may be tempted to only look at the past couple of months, but really think about the entire year. Maybe the person is not currently posting, but still made an impact over the year. I haven't posted a News topic for it. Posting it up here so that those who wish to nominate people but haven't noticed the thread in events can do that. We are leaving nominations open til 9th January. If you don't nominate the people that you think deserve it, then they have no chance of being in the polls and you can't complain during the voting.
