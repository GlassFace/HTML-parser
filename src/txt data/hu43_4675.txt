 #BlackLivesMatter Dartmouth College Course
 Source:http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/04/living...-lives-matter/ It's just a college course that just looks at racial history of African Americans, connects them to events like Ferguson, and looks at black activism. In my opinion this should have never been created, because this will further emphasize that only black lives matter when it comes to issues like this. A college student a while back was scrutinized because she claimed all lives matter when faced with injustice with police officers, and wrongfully apologized thus creation of #onlybalcklivesmatter. 
 Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide. *Bill The Butcher - Gangs Of New York* 
 When I had heard the original story of the Ferguson shooting it was told that the officer had executed Mike Brown when he had surrendered and was in a submission position. I found this absolutely appalling and you can actually find some of my own posts and comments on this before more info came out. Then the evidence came out that Brown assaulted the officer while he was in his car (Picture of the officer's wounds, the blood splatter stains/DNA on the INSIDE of the driver-side car door, Brown's personal handkerchief on the door of the vehicle, and the 2 x .40 cal casings near the vehicle), and the rest of the evidence at the scene where Brown actually died indicates that Brown was moving toward the officer with shell casings extending BACKWARDS in retreat with Brown's blood as he was moving FORWARDS toward the officer with NONE of the shots entering entering Brown's back. Furthermore many of the witnesses testimony contradicted each other, with several witnesses admitting to changing their statements based on what others had said rather than what they had actually witnessed. There was a seriously ****ed up authority response to the Ferguson protests, and yes racism STILL exists in this country, but the narrative these people were pushing was completely opposite of what all the physical evidence suggests. There has been an alarming trend in US newsmedia of picking up and running with whatever "social justice" narrative they can without ever verifying it. They want to be part of an instrument of change rather than documenting the evidence for it. I'm not surprised people want to capitalize on this: "Come to our college, look at how progressive we are with our social teachings! Come here, give us your money, boost the standing of our institution, accept the narrative that appeals to you rather than critically evaluating events based on facts and evidence! Look we can make up our own links to past factual events to establish credibility for a false narrative, come join us make the world a better place!" The best characterization for this poison seeping into academia is the video of the white college student direly trying to convince a black LAPD police officer (that has suffered racism in the deep south) that he's oppressed based on his skin color while he remarks on the discrimination he faces for wearing a badge.

 It saddens me to see this country become so deeply entangled in racial matters. Getting past racism is vital, but the path that has been shown in the past year or two is one where almost every action or reaction is seen as racist. There is racism, but not to the level that the media and others would have one believe. In fact, many of the things that people who are trying to be "progressive" are doing is very racist, but they feel because their reason is righteous (in their minds), it is not racist. And that attitude is what allows racism to take root and become standard. I heard someone say that hating white people because they are white is NOT racist because whites are the majority and hatred of majorities is not racism. Sorry, but hatred of anyone because of their skin color IS racist. But so many people feel this way that is truly scares me.

 Whether there may have been some things that looked bad or Michael Brown, that trial was really sketchy, with the lack of any cross-examination (and the lack of wounds to Darren Wilson), and that one witness testifying against Brown. There were clearly problems with this. I hate to offend anyone, but there's a clear reason why #blacklivesmatter says black lives. There are much higher rates of police violence/racial profiling towards black people. True, there are other minorities with other issues, but #alllivesmatter is just kind of pedantic and generally dismissive towards it when it's an issue that is very racially charged. Reminds me of how people hate on black pride saying it should be ~~human pride~~ instead. It's possible to support one thing without dismissing another. As for the course, great. Again, I don't see why OP has a problem with black history and linking it to current events being taught. i.e. is teaching Ukrainian history focusing on Ukrainians bad because it's saying the Ukraine protests are all that matters ? Black activism is an actual important subject. 
 You know, most liberal arts schools already have a diversity requirement. I had to take one too when I was in college and took an interesting philosophy elective "contemporary moral problems" to fit the bill. It's not like courses like these are anything new. That said, I find it silly it's supposedly so interdisciplinary with math and geography and contains poetry. I question what can actually be accomplished with such a class. At the very least, with the one I took, it applied some of the traditional moral theories you learned to discussions on things like abortion, welfare, crime, etc. I'd love to look at the recent issues through a Nietzschean lens for example, because I doubt most viewpoints would escape unscathed. I feel like there's a strong tendency towards feeling victimized, right or wrongly, and starting to resent the other side. I feel that state legislatures have been driving this bus one way for a long while and that is to be honest where most of the decisions will be made on these things (Michigan for example is talking of reinstitution of the death penalty for people who kill cops). As a corollary to that, I also kind of wonder if we're exploding with information overload these days. Misremember facts, social narratives, and twitter to drive it all.

At the very least, with the one I took, it applied some of the traditional moral theories you learned to discussions on things like abortion, welfare, crime, etc. I'd love to look at these sorts of issues from a Nietzschean perspective for example, cause I think most things won't escape unscathed. I also kind of wonder if we're exploding with information overload these days. Misremember facts, social narratives, and twitter to drive it all. Didn't notice the math and geography tie-in until now, that's a bit weird. I wonder how they would do that, though. Analyzing political statistics or something like that? Most interdisc courses suck unless you have a good professor. The history + literature course i took mostly involved tangentially tying issues together and writing dull papers regurgitating points made by other people. I guess because a lot of people, including college-aged students, are personally involved in that activism it might be interesting.

All of that evidence should have been presented in a trial so that a jury of peers could have decided whether the officer was guilty or not. He wasn't even indicted because the prosecutor threw the case and even admitted it which immediately raises a red flag.

Even engineering schools require that every student take so many credits worth of humanities and "current issues" courses. We've entered loopy land in MI with a Democrat suggesting the re-institution of the death penalty for people who kill cops and a Republican, who used to be a cop, actually coming out out against it. ""Occasionally, the system makes a mistake,” Jones said. “If a mistake is made, we can’t dig somebody up and say we’re sorry. If somebody’s in prison, we can release them.

He wasn't even indicted because the prosecutor threw the case and even admitted it which immediately raises a red flag. The grand jury deal was absolutely a farce, but the reality is that the evidence showed that it wasn't worth prosecuting the officer in the first place as no crime had been committed, it was really all done in a half-hearted attempt to placate a vocal populace literally calling for the officer's head while avoiding lengthy court proceedings. Yes I think there is absolutely a significant element for corruption in this type of proceeding, and I'm really against many closed and silenced aspects of the legal system, but the reality is that the entire response was driven by the media frenzy and all of the physical evidence points to it not being worth it to try and prosecute the officer. Let's say they did go through a standard legal proceeding though, the officer is in court, all the evidence is presented, much money and legal time is expended and at the end of it all the officer is found not-guilty of commiting a crime. What then? Just like in the Trayvon Martin case the populace and media who had latched on to this narrative of racism will REJECT the verdict and claim it as further proof of a biased, and corrupt legal system that doesn't value the lives of people based on their skin color. I'm all for a more open legal system, I'm also against the media lynching whomever the mob's next target is. We've seen this in several recent cases of rape allegations that ended up being demonstrably false (yet people called for castration and imprisonment whilst harassing those being accused), the numerous cases of the media claiming to present pictures of terrorists and purpetrators which ended up being false (Boston marathon bombing etc.) and we saw it in the Trayvon Martin case where it was reported that an ethnically white man shot an ethnically black man based on race despite Zimmerman being ethnically hispanic, there being no evidence that Zimmerman was or is racist, and all the physical evidence pointing to Zimmerman acting in self-defense while being assaulted. I only bring up the ethnicity deal because it was such a goddamned important aspect of the narrative the media was desperate to shove down our throats. Again in that case Zimmerman probably shouldn't have been following Martin around, but that's not illegal, and it all of that goes out the window when it's provable that Zimmerman WAS in-fact assaulted. Again, with the Zimmerman trial you had everyone disagreeing with the jury and rejecting the verdict anyways. I actually remember asking in the CE thread on the Martin case what the point of our legal system was if everyone was going to blatantly reject legal verdicts based on whatever narrative they WANTED to believe rather than what the physical evidence TELLS us. US news media has for years been pushing hard to be part of all these social aspects to keep their 24 hour networks relevant, this has resulted in biased and blatantly false reporting. It's no longer about the facts it's about what people say and feel, look at how the news weaves in social media "critique" on every issue. The problem is that you can't tell the media to not do what they are doing because of the rare case when we actually NEED them to bring up a serious issue that wouldn't otherwise see the light of day, unfortunately they've felt that this gives them a free pass to promote narratives now and absolves them of any wrongdoings.

Again, with the Zimmerman trial you had everyone disagreeing with the jury and rejecting the verdict anyways We'll never know if a crime was committed or not because none of the evidence was brought to trial. On top of that the PROSECUTOR'S key witness was a racist fraud who was not even present at the scene and lied about everything. Our justice system IS biased towards minorities and any argument against that is denial. Blacks and whites use drugs equally as much but blacks are incarcerated for drug crimes 3-4x as much. That's just one statistic out of a long list. As for the Trayvon Martin case I actually agree with the juries decision. The prosecution was stupid and went for a second degree murder verdict instead of man-slaughter. The jury even asked for a clarification on manslaughter and the judge wrote a contradictory instruction paper to the jury which defined manslaughter absent of the definition of involuntary manslaughter which Zimmerman would have been easily found guilty of. So the jury WANTED to convict Zimmerman of manslaughter but when they asked for clarification on how they could they were only given the definition of one of the SEVEN definitions of manslaughter. The prosecution in the Martin case was stupid and the judge was either stupid or had other intentions. If the jury was given the correct definition then they would have convicted him but they didn't even know it so I can't blame them.
