 https://www.facebook.com/a4animeforums We have an official Facebook page, so LIKE it. We plan to keep you updated on new anime, links to anime reviews (so create new ones lol), A4 news, highlight awesome threads by our members, post A4 competition winners, you name it. It's basically just getting up and running at the moment, so like it and invite your friends who like anime to like it. =D You make great threads, we'll post a link to them on Facebook so everyone will be made aware of them. We'll try to highlight a couple of A4 threads every week or so if we have the content. ^^ 
 Do you RP, or are you interested in learning? Join our Role Player's Society here on A4. Would you like a baseball bat to shove up your ass along with that stick? You're a mod, please act like one A4 is on FACEBOOK
