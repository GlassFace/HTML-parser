 RIP Tony Verna
 I'm listing this in television as there isn't an official sports thread. Tony Verna died on Sunday after a losing his battle with leukemia. He was 81. I don't believe anyone on this site is old enough (myself included) to remember the first time he performed the trick in 1963 during an Army/Navy football game. Mr. Verna had designed a revolutionary system, and he wanted to debut it's trick after a commercial break. The announcer, Lindsey Nelson, wasn't sure what to say, but he did make it clear to the viewers at home that what they were watching wasn't live. It was the very first instant replay. I'm sure any one of you reading this have, at times during your life, no matter how long or short it has been, have both blessed and cursed Mr. Verna for his invention, but I believe we can all agree that we couldn't imagine life, today, without it. Thank you Mr. Verna. May you rest in peace.
