[Review] Legend of zelda thread!
 I am a huge fan of Legend of Zelda so I decided I would make a thread about it on here for the people who enjoy LOZ as well! It's an impressive franchise in my opinion... My favorite game so far is Ocarina of Time. It's an old game but it's put together so well and the story is awesome. I love all of it, although I haven't been able to play all of the games quite yet.
