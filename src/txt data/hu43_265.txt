[Anime] What are you currently watching?
 Blue Gender- I watched this eons ago when it first aired on Adult Swim and somehow I missed the final episode, I had hoped that the show would go on with re runs, most shows did but they never aired the show again, so 2 decades later I'm back *****es. This show still retains some dope ass qualities, it's bloody, its has the fan service and it doesn't two d**** about characters, I think of it like a precursor to game of thrones and the walking dead where characters will die and there's no guarantee for anybody. The show sadly though is funnier than it is dramatic. A lot of Yuji's expressions are hilarious, then I have confusion with Yuji's narration, is he talking to us, thinking to himself? There are flashbacks too to moments we already know about, an opening song that doesn't jive with the tone of the series and of course with most anime shows there are the awkward sexual interactions. I'm on episode 12, so well see. Ooooooooooo!
