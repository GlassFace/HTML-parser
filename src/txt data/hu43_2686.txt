 Is it just me, or is Usopp the worst character?
 I've read the manga, but didn't start watching the anime until recently and water 7 just kills me on this character. I could take the goofy cowardice, but the way he acts during this arc is downright awful.

 Yes, I do not like Usopp either. The stupid cowardice aside, the fact that Oda always lets him get away with dumb luck is ridiculous and getting old. It is nice that he always turn around at the end, but you would think that he would improve as a person by now. I personally dislike these kind of comic relief characters. He is pretty bad in the current manga arc too.

 ...........Sogeking is one of the best parts of Usopp. I loved when he came back as Sogeking and loved when he showed up to Enies Lobby. Do you not like Usopp type characters in other anime or manga as well? Maybe say the point where you were just "groaning" about his actions. I remember hating him a lot at the beginning of the Water 7 arc. Cause obviously he acts like a douche thinking he can be captain or some nonsense. In general his character doesn't really bother me. I think the fact his "lies" or fibs actually become real things is kinda cool or the speculation that Usopp will actually be controlling some kind of huge army is awesome (Might be tontanas in this arc as previously discussed.)

 Usopp did a pretty good job in this current manga arc would not discuss this more to avoid spoilers. But man come to think of it he just really care to the ship plus it's their first ship alot of memories are there he just can't accept burning it. Water 7 still the best arc!

Water 7 still the best arc! *** This a a great big spoiler. *** The part where he picks the fight with Luffy over the Merry is what bugs me the most. I recall blurring over it in the manga, but the anime really ramps up the tensions. I've heard a lot of people say "well, he's just concerned about a friend, etc." but to me it's like fighting with your family when someone gets sick/is dying. It's pretty awful to lay it on like that at the worst point. The outright denial he went through made me sour a bit on his character.

Having one good moment does not make him a likeable character.

 Yeah, it's a tough thing to say I wouldn't dislike Usopp type characters in other manga. Thinking about it, the one obvious comparison is Hercule from DBZ and I think it was tough to be a fan of his character too.

If I recall correctly I think ussop was pissed that they thought about buying new ship and letting go of this one which would have been the equivalent of giving up on a sick/dying family member. Take the anime with a grain of salt anyways (albeit it's fun) but the manga is the best version of the story and I forgot the difference if any.

Well, Hercule was a more minor character that did not always get the win in the end thanks to dumb luck. His lack of screen time actually make him tolerable. The way that Usopp managed to help everyone in the current manga arc as a perfect example of this dumb luck nonsense, and it was rather ridiculous. I would be happier if Oda actually tried to develop Usopp's character rather than try to repeat the same old gags over and over.

 IMO Frankey is the worst character. Then Chopper. I hate both of them more then Ussop!

 Pfft. Chopper is way better than Usopp.

I agree with you, I think it's better if we see Ussop more in a battle than in a funny scene, but it's not like Ussop isn't developing. In the last 2 chapters I've heard fewer excuses and lies from him and although he gets scared from time to time, he's much bolder/braver than his pre-timeskip version. I think there's a good chance in the future where we can see Ussop on par with the monster trio. Remember, Ussop joined the crew with the goal of becoming a "brave man of the sea". If he achieves his goal by the end of the story, I'd say he'll be one of the characters that has improved greatly.

I have no idea what you are talking about because he actually ran out on everyone only to come back later, like he always does.
