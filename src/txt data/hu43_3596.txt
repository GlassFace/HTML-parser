 Vegeta vs Hulk!
 The moon is a 5th of the earth, i am pretty sure by the time anybody could go super saying, EVERYBODY was well over 5 times piccolo's power when he did the moon in. Plus i am sure there are quite a few references in the anime to how someone could blow up the planet. Also dont miss out the point I made about battle of gods. Beerus can destroy like 6 planets in a matter of seconds with no fatigue, and vegeta took a punch in the face from him and the hit back harder My point of comparing cell was that cell only survived as long as he did because of regeneration. Hulk does a similar thing, he can be injured he just regenerates. My point was the massive energy effects we see in dbz would do the same thing, tear him apart at the smallest level. If you did that there would be no irradiated organic matter to repair itself. So if you hit him with a big shot in one go, he is screwed.
