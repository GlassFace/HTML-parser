[Adventure] Pokemon Origins
 "Do you want to give your pokemon a nickname?" That was one of the few parts that really made me want to facepalm, but in saying that the story overall is alot more relatable then the original. I think this is all due to how it is portrayed and the type of characters they've chosen and the direction of the story. I personally thought Ash was a bit of a dopey character. He had a Pikachu that didn't want to evolve, a Charizard that didn't listen to him and he found all his starters. Then when he went to a new zone he gave up all his pokemon all the time. T_T Bah!!! Anyways I've only seen the first one so far and I'm enjoying it so far. I found it interesting how Brock chose 2 pokemon to vs Red out of a possible 6. That was an aspect that I never really thought of as it sort of relates to the later games how when you re-verse Gym Leaders they can have different or even stronger Pokemon. Something the originals lacked. It also brings in the idea that all the Gym Leaders don't have to be versed in an certain order. I'm also curious to see what Red's later pokemon are gonna be and whether Green has a Radicate that possibly dies and becomes the Ghost in Lavender town.
