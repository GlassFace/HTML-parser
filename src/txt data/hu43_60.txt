 How can we improve Extended Discussion?
 It's simple if you ask me. #Extended back in a sub-forum. #Heavy mod Extended. As Tenken pointed out, it is a concern when this nonsense becomes too frequent that it begins to be expected. The players that enjoy in-depth discussions shouldn't have to expect spam and derailment (sic) I mean, really - just over two years? Wow. If people care enough members and staff alike, sort this sh*t out already.
