 Life as an Artist

Saying there is no such thing as an artist is like saying there is no such thing as a Doctor. It's an actual thing, there is no room for interpretation. As in, Art is a noun. A thing that exists in the world, created by people. If somebody who paints is a painter and not an artist, then a Dermatologist is just that and not a Doctor. I'm all for mocking pretentious, scarf-wearing hipsters, but you can't just redefine a word out of spite.
