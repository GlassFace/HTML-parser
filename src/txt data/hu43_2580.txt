You gave her the Idea and she took off with it months ago from what I read, So the catfight might have a dead Fonda cat now here, but the other cats from back then and more that took up her cause are still running around (with the sh*t I saw, she's even got you down pat hun, offering more on what she can't do herself again). not me hun, I never said sh*t to anyone. She outsmarted you, and doesn't have to show up herself Shannon, you can put all the work into things here, but she still has the upper hand, derailing you with her subordinates before they join or make interest here and want to be subordinates for the past months, more so now want to join here for the benefits she gives to New RP's and what I read hun. and No I aint one of them. But giving you the gears back as you did to me. that's a good feeling. and thanks to fonda for what she's done already. ^_^

Being salty over something on a internet forum. ****ing hilarious. I know you'll be reading this since you are salty as **** and know no better, it's shits like you that make the user base drop in IQ points by just posting, do me a favour and never sign up for a forum ever gain. Why don't you stop talking in general while at it, since every little thing causes you to lose your ****, learn to respect someone's opinion.

 First of all, I would have to interact with someone in order to have a fight with them. Fonda has been warned already about causing drama in the Role Players Realm and was previously banned for 30 days. Rather than coming back and behaving herself, she went straight back to posting the same tripe in the RP discussions thread. Personally, I don't have time for people like this, and neither do the other mods or admins. It is a waste of time that we could be using to do other things. It is quite immature to be the centre of drama, and then when you are told to stop, turn around and accuse the mods who tell you to stop that they are the ones causing drama. The sane thing to do would be to just stop being a drama llama. Just stop. That simple. Fonda and Godless are more than likely the same person, and to be quite honest, no one really cares. If you have to make accounts to talk to yourself, who am I to judge? I'm not deleting this stuff anymore. I usually do it so that a topic stays on topic, but I have just decided to split this mess and leave it here, so people can see just how ridiculous you really are. They'll just come back on more "friend" accounts and accuse me of deleting "evidence." Posts are never properly deleted, only hidden from the public, just as an FYI. Any mod can read/undelete posts. Tired of it at this stage. Both accounts have been permabanned, along with her new account "noone."

 I was never in the drama club, but I give mad props to those kids who where. Getting up on stage in front of the whole school would have me stuttering and forgetting lines like it was my job. I also enjoy live plays, so I'm happy there are people who are able to do it.

That's not what this thread is about.

 See, if Rp'ing was actually like this dramatic maybe more people would click on this part of the forum. [citation needed] Pre-emtive 'No yooooooo' spell. + 5 rep damage. Did I do that right? I actually have no idea how I got to this thread. Kind of.

 Oh man and I was worried about having a boring day and I get this thread as a nice surprise!

 All the drama has been drained.
