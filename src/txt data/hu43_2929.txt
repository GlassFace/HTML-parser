[Personal Life Discussions] Deities, what do you believe in?
 Deities, what do you believe in? So this isn't so much a 'Does God Exist?', but a more do you believe in God and if so what God do you believe in? Do you follow a religion such as Christianity, Islam, Buddhism or Judaism. Or would you prefer not to be labelled. Are you Atheist, Agnostic, Theist or Dentist? My beliefs Personally I believe in God though I don't like to label myself as part of any religion, I find a belief in God should be personal and being part of a religion makes me feel as if I need to share that belief (which I suppose you would). I don't believe in Christ being the son of God though I believe in his existence and the miracles he performed. I suppose I'm merely Agnostic, I want to believe in God and to a large extent I do as I've already mentioned. Though I still want to look into it more and find out for myself what's out there. I can't imagine something as complex as our Universe to of just come out of nothing. So what do you believe in? So to put it simply, what do you believe in and why do you believe it? Have you been brought up to believe what you currently put your faith in, or have you chosen to be a part of it yourself? Note Please keep in mind that many people have varying beliefs and we should all respect one another, there's no reason to insult each others as it comes off as immature and childish. Lets keep the discussion friendly.
