[OOC] Possible Naruto Roleplay please read..
 RP section is like a firework. Light it and it soars off for a while, then just fizzes out. I prefer my RPs to be laden with a well constructed storyline, wonderful character development, and a solid episodic progression instead of improv with complicated chars. All we need...is a really big lighter...and a big ass firework.
