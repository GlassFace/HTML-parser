 The Big 3 Manga (Is is worth it?)
 I've watched through the original Naruto only and not through Shippuuden, so I can't comment much on it. I haven't seen Bleach at all. One Piece, though, I have watched through and am reading the manga weekly chapters now. Since you said you were half through with it, what did you think of it up until this point and on what arc are you currently? Do you have specific questions?
