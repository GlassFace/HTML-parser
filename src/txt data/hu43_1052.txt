 Please don't respond to spambots.
 Hi everyone, ^^ I know we've asked this before at some point, and we have a lot of new members since then who don't know. Please don't quote, or respond to spambots. It makes our job more difficult when we are cleaning up the forums, as we then need to delete the replies as well. I know that currently, there seem to be a lot of them popping up, and they are indeed annoying. But you guys can help us fight them by reporting them. Report button is a small triangle under the avatar. Thanks guys.
