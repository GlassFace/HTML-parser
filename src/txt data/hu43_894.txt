So did he  Spoiler ask Rion to marry him, because he didn't want her to be "alone" anymore? And he feels like he HAS to because he raped her? Like I have no clue.  Spoiler AND did L-elf anticipate this into his plans? Seeing as he didn't write this down, maybe he didn't. But maybe he did, and he wanted to just take things into his own hands. I just don't know what to think. This anime has gotten so much better over the last two episodes because all of the craziness but  Spoiler As a love interest I believe Rukino and Haruto just make sense she was the kids first kiss lol and I wouldn't necessarily call it rape because at the end of the day she wanted it to happen because she gave in when she could have done something to stop it. As for Shoko I feel bad for her because they both had mutual feelings for each other but I also believe Haruto didn't choose Rukino out of pity because I think he to had feelings for her as she did him. On a side note L-elf is badass regardless lol
