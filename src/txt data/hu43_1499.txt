[Comedy] NouCome (Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Come o Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru)
 A romantic comedy with a REALLY long name, lol! Translated it means, "My Mental Multiple-Choice Power Is Completely Ruining My School Romantic Comedy". Good thing it has the abbreviated name of "NouCome". Synopsis: The story centers around Kanade Amakusa, a boy cursed with the mental power of "absolute multiple-choice". A multiple-choice quiz will suddenly appear in his mind, and the choice he makes will become his reality. For example, he would have to choose between going nude from the waist up or the waist down in school. While in school, he is given another choice: 1) A beautiful girl will fall before him or 2) he will fall from the rooftop in female clothes. He chooses option 1, and a blonde girl named Chocolat falls before him. Facebook Fanpage: https://www.facebook.com/NouCome.anime and https://www.facebook.com/Noucome.IMAGE

 Aside from the fact that once again I see attractive anime females, reading about this anime; it actually seems so funny. 
 So clever! Very fast-paced anime with a lot to take in. The gags are pretty sophisticated. I like it!

 YOU MAGGOTS!!! lol. I enjoyed episode one. It is definitely something different and I like Yukihara aka white hair already. But I liked the opening and ending, and I like the animation a lot, so im gonna keep on it. :3 

 I'll definetly choose, option 1: WATCH THE REST.

 Finally got around to watching it tonight and it was great, wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Think I'll choose to keep watching too 
 Very good episode 2. When he was squealing like a pig I lost it. Also dont feed chocolate to Dogs...they will die haha. That ending though. Woooo Very good.

 "This person has a really smooth voice, seriously who is this?" "It's God" XD 

 I just lost it. It's hilarious! Yukihira <333 "Good morning, you piggish bastard." LMAO

 Wahaahaha, I only started this anime, the introduction was great! I love the two options and really, I had a great time starting the anime series. The middle section of the anime was 'okay', 'meh' - not exactly anyting interesting or funny. But that ending o 3o Promises a lot 
 
 When he had tears in his eyes and they turned to bloody tears I lost it. Very funny episode. 

 That student council president knows something is up. Also that mission is going to be pretty difficult. 

 Think this was the first episode that didn't make me want to cover my eyes at any point, I liked it  Spoiler Think that girl that is supposed to be the most popular student is also an angel, she looks alittle like chocolat atleast and made that comment about her being so cute it's almost like she's not human. Want Utage to get more time in an episode eventually too

 I think  Spoiler the Student Council president is behind all the choices he needs to make. But the Jealousy by Yukihira makes me like her as a character more. "Tits tits calm down now" XD WTF!!! 

 ....Was that a G Gundam reference in episode 5? 
 I've been watching it (finished ep 4 yesterday) gotta say better than most harem comedy animes! the beginning of ep 1 was very inspiring/comedic/random but whatevs! The intro is also upbeat too!
