 The Big 3 Manga (Is is worth it?)
 ^ Your right YumYum about that being the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, you still have a few arcs to go before the Fishman Island Arc. Bleach Sucks, Naruto is all about saving Sasuke and once I realized that I lost interest in it. As for One Piece, I both read the manga and watch the anime. I read the manga because it's quick, but I watch the anime because a lot of times it goes into more depth than the manga, making you understand the story better. It's up to you if you want to get into the manga, I mainly read it because it's quicker than watching the anime and gets to the point with everything but in that quickness you loose depth so I watch the anime.
