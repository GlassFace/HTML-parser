[General Discussion] Guys realtalk: The snow attacking New England is insane
 For the past few weeks or so, snow has been stacking up higher and higher in my neighborhood. My city is kinda in bad shape in some areas, and now we're in risk of having school in July. Things that's been pissing me off is people not shoveling their sidewalks and people not shoveling the sidewalks on some roads. You have to walk on the streets and if you live in Rhode Island it's like asking for a death wish. I like to know what it's like in your towns or states. 
 Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide. *Bill The Butcher - Gangs Of New York* 
 A licky boom boom down. No snow here. Its a bit nippy outside though. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 I live in Minnesota. No sympathies for the occasional snow accumulation, however silly the amount. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 I moved to Atlanta recently from Michigan. I went back to Michigan to get my car and have been stranded. I miss living in a land with no snow already. I was surprised at how pleasant it actually was.

 Hang in there rabbit Chan! We had about a foot last Monday. I can sympathize.

 I'm just mad that it's not as disastrous as they make it seem on weather forecasts here in NYC.

One of the rare times I agree with you, I live in Wisconsin and the roads here are clear, we get our s*it together pretty quickly and the snow fall is clear within a day or so, doesn't mean the roads aren't slick still. Good luck Rabbit-Chan just gotta deal with it I guess.

 Be glad it's not as bad as they said it was going to be in NY. Try living just outside Boston and see what being buried alive means. Many of the previous snow records for Boston were broken yesterday, and 3 more inches fell last night. Today and Wednesday are supposed to be sunny, which is good as the sun will go to work and help clear the roads, however, the next storm, which hits on Thursday night, is expected to dump another foot of snow inside 12 hours. The word blizzard was mentioned on the news. The good news is that, if Thursday is a blizzard then it may alter the weather pattern to keep the snow away from New England for a while. If it doesn't, then there's another storm on Sunday going into Monday that will dump at least a foot on the region. If you haven't had to deal with snow, I'm happy for you. Be glad you haven't. Here's the current situation in Boston: MBTA (Boston's public transportation system): Commuter and subway rails shut down indefinitely. Limited bus service available. Parking Bans in place for Boston and many of the cities across the state. State of Emergency was declared by governor Baker last night. Businesses, although open, are suffering badly as people can't get to them. The mounds of snow on the street (which are eating up all the parking spaces) are now over 7 feet tall. There is, literally, no place left to put the snow. Snow removal trucks are taking the snow off of major streets but the side streets are atrocious. If you're stuck here, worry about your own sidewalk and driveway before you worry about someone elses. Clear yours out first, then help the neighbors. If you're like me, and your back, after shoveling snow for the last 2 weeks, has said enough is enough, then take advantage of the kids looking to make some cash by shoveling. I've already given those kids $120 to shovel out the sidewalk and driveway 3 times, and it looks like they may make another $120 before the weekend is out. The artic air isn't going anywhere anytime soon, so the snow can't melt. And I shudder to think what will happen when it does start to melt (storm drains are buried. There's no place for the water to go).

 and if you live in Rhode Island it's like asking for a death wish I've always loved snow, but this is slightly overboard. School closures everywhere, and I picked a terrible year for an hour drive commute. It's like every other day I'm asking myself if school will be delayed or closed (my school can't give a warning ahead of time to save their life) then half the time it isn't and I go outside and realize my street hasn't been plowed and I couldn't go anywhere even if I wanted to. 4 weeks into the semester and Monday classes haven't even met yet. Well, here's to hoping the forecast for tomorrow and Thursday are slightly off and we don't get snow.
