[Fantasy] Date A live
 Thirty years ago a strange phenomena called a "spacequake" devastated the center of Eurasia, claiming the lives of at least 150 million people. Since then, smaller spacequakes plague the world on a irregular basis. Shidō Itsuka, a seemingly ordinary high schooler comes across a mysterious girl at the ground zero of a spacequake and learns from his sister Kotori she is one of the "Spirits" who are the real cause of the spacequakes that occur when they manifest themselves in the world. He also learns that Kotori is the captain of the airship Ratatoskr and recruits him to make use of his mysterious ability to seal the Spirits' powers and stop them from being a threat to mankind. However, there is a catch: to seal a Spirit, he must make her fall in love with him. Summary by Wikipedia Feels like KamiNomi with a fantasical and action twist, based on the summary and the PV. I've tried to read the Light Novel for a bit, and it turned out to be quite good. I hope the anime will be able to be as good as the light novel. Personally my most awaited series of this season. The PV: 
 Life is a process--just one thing after another. When you lose it, just start again. ~OSU! Profile~
