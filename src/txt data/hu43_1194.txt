[Action] Kill La Kill

Maybe I'll give it another try in the future. Much agreed. With Kill la kill it was just boring to me. Although the art was amazing I will give it that, every episode felt like I had watched it over and over again. Girl fights villian, girl gets new power, girl wins, rinse and repeat, literally just a long tedious fight scene over and over again. Cliched and lazy. Loved the art direction, loved the character designs, thought the show it self was a huge pile of crap.
