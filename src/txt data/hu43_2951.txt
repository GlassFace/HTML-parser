 What have you been drawing lately?
 "Talent" seems to be a way to describe someone who spends a lot of time on something without it feeling like a total drag. When I first enrolled into art college the only thing I had over someone who'd never drawn a day in their life is thousands of hours spent drawing, thinking about drawing, watching other people drawing, and so on. This isn't any different from someone who eats, sleeps, and breathes cars, we just find it very easy to spend time doing and thinking about something that we love. Talent is the ability to not be bored of something and to work to master it when you could be doing something else. When someone sees all this work culminated in the latest thing you created they won't appreciate what it took to get there and just assume you burst out of the womb with this ability. This is partly because we're raised in a society that does not value artists, people just think that you either have it or you don't because they don't know any better.
