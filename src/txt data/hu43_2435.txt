The fact that we are unable to sustain an interesting culture makes us pretty useless - and people then wonder why I look to Japan for my cultural enjoyment needs. yeah it seems it's only Christians who are in there 40's up and pop culture who seem to stand out as normal and when it comes to people from different cultures and countries they're just different and they will always be different just because from where they are from unless it's someone who's polish or french or someone else from a country in Europe with Russia maybe in a few cases an exception. I really wouldn't mind knowing manga's & anime's stereotypes.
