 Bloodiest anime ever?
 As we all know and I've written in my book "How to be an anime character" an anime character's body contains roughly 30 gallons of blood under intense pressure. So what is the bloodiest anime of all time? What anime has spilled more painted blood than any other? Or what's the bloodiest YOU'VE seen anyway. 
 that Ive seen? Code geass has to be the bloodiest I've seen or ghost hunter in that bloody labyrinth one but that was only 2 or 3 eps's Code geass on the other hand had blood from the geko. Elfen lied Ive HEARD is bloody but never seen it nor do I want to 
 From what I've seen, either Berserk or Elfin Lied.

 From the youtube clips I've seen of it, Violence Jack is probably the worst offender out there. And this is coming from someone who's seen Ninja Scroll and Elfen Lied. Here's a sample: (Warning- it's pretty brutal) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dsyQuRoM5U

 hahaha Ya, that Violence Jack clip was pretty brutal. 3x3 Eyes is one of the bloodiest anime I've ever seen. The main character in particular gets his ass whooped a number of times to the point where you ask yourself "does the human body even have that much blood?"

 i would have to say "Elfen Lied" for me. that one is just so, gory in like EVERY episode. >.<

 Some people say Karin, but I am not sure nosebleeds should count. Personally I have to go with Vampire Hunter D. It's hard to top a freaking waterfall of blood.

 Genocyber deserves a mention in a thread like this. Youtube it. Dokuro-chan also should be mentioned. It's been a while since i've seen that one but I think I remember it being pretty bloody in a stupid kind of way.

 Higurasji No Naku koro Ni (When The Cinidels Cry) was pretty bloody. Elfin Lied of course. I saw some "H" that was more bloody than sexual. Berserk Ninja Scrolls One scene from kill bill (anime) Hellsing

 Elfen Lied was really bloody. Number 1 for me. 
 
 I would have to say for most violent, realistic and brutal would have to be Shirugui: Dark Frenzy. I loved this series but the ending left too much open. bah!\ Gantz was also pretty damn brutal and violent/bloody. The manga was way worse but the anime was still gory. 
 I didn't like Gantz that much. Although it was very bloddy, I forgot about it.

 Has to be KITE for me. Damn bloody anime. Very gorey to the core. After that Elfen Lied I suppose. Hmm. . maybe Hellsing. Those are the top things I've seen.

 I was gonna say Kite but didn't know if it breached the rules. Shigurui was extremely gory (and effing brilliant) but I don't think it rates as 'bloodiest'.

 Hellsing Ultimate takes a grand position. I guess Elfen Lied is quite close, oceans of blood there too. If I remember correctly Berserk also has a fair amount. Higurashi no Koro Ni has its share too, although slightly less. I know there are some really, really bloody out there but I have yet to see them.

 i gotta say either elfen lied or violence jack takes the cake.

 I've gotta say the bloodiest show's that I've ever seen are Elfen Lied and Hellsing:Ultimate. Gantz was pretty bloody too... 

 Elfen Lied and Claymore. Those are the top two animes I've seen with gallons of blood loss.

Berserk Ninja Scrolls One scene from kill bill (anime) Hellsing Yup Yup.. I never seen Ninja scroll or a few others. Also when you mentioned Hellsing I hope you meant the Unlimited series. Tiss so much goryer and more violent. Plus you get to see them fight Nazi's and Alucard take a Girls Rifle and Stab her in the heart with it. @person who said Code Geass that anime sucks IMO..not only is it boring but..if you think its bloody then you need to watch..MORE anime. There is soooo much out there that is a whole lot more violent.
