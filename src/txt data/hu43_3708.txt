 [GITS] Scarlett Johansson = Motoko Kusanagi
 I don't know if a thread about this has been brought up but... ahhh.....ehhhh.... It's not that I dislike her. And I can't think of who I'd like better. But I'm a huge GITS fan. And the Motoko I know? ...I just can't see Scarlett as her.

 I think they could have done a lot worse, but if they must have a caucasian actress, I'd rather have Emily Blunt or Eva Green.

 She did play black widow.

 Ghost in the shell! Now I get it! I had no idea what gits was. (I had to look it up on YouTube with gits - Johansson) Never saw gits but I do like johansson in avengers and cap 2.

 Scarlett? I think she'll do a good job of portraying the beast we know as The Major. However I can't really imagine her with purple hair.

 This may just be my personal opinion, but I've never really liked her acting... She seems wooden from the few roles I've seen her, particularly as the Black Widow (of which in the role she never really convinced me as playing Black Widow). I've always found other actresses' acting more interesting anyway, like Jodie Foster or Charlize Theron. I even liked Ellen Page in ​Hard Candy. Then of course, there's the fact that she's not even half-Asian, and yet she's playing someone named Motoko Kusanagi. The Asian aspect of the character probably won't matter much in the story, but I still don't like this kind of whitewashing. Lastly, on an off-topic note, this movie's directed by the same guy who did Snow White and the Huntsman and Van Helsing... neither of which were very good movies.

 Crucially, they haven't mentioned what her character name will be yet. Don't be too surprised if we end up watching Major Marilyn Kowalski.

 She has big tits and can't act for ****. Apparently Hollywood thinks this is the ideal combination for an actor who would play a sexy cyborg. Even if all they want is a superficially good choice for Kusanagi, Johanssen isn't the best one. Also, with other characters so much more easily whitewashed, you'd think they could have done enough of their Westernization elsewhere and left Kusanagi Japanese as she should be. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

I tend to be against mainstream actors in these type of movies. I think a lesser known actor would probably be a better idea to suspend disbelief. But the whole Kusangi needing to be japanese isn't necessary. But I think the decision for her not to be japanese is that they need an audience to target and relate to. "Whitewashing" doesn't really matter as long as the characters personalities are well portrayed beyond a superficial one. I think it sounds like something weaboos would be concerned for. 
 The actor serves the character not the other way around. The fact that the major is Japanese in the anime isn't a big part of her character so it wouldn't matter if they got Scarlett Johansson or ariana grande to play her. As long as her overall character remains unchanged there's nothing to get wiggy about

I don't think she can cater to Kusanagi and I am disappointed in this casting choice. I agree with Zer0 in that I'd rather have a lesser known actress. I'm not sure what I am suppose to expect but I can already tell it won't feel anything like an authentic GITS experience.

 I actually liked that movie. There have been soooo many different adaptations of Street Fighter. I found that one comical and entertaining. I just didn't take it so seriously. But GITS....I take that very seriously.

Raul Julia isn't even around to save it with campiness like with Street Fighter.

 Relax. lol. I have a feeling that this is going to be a western adaption rather than a direct adaption from the anime. Don't be surprised if you see it set in New York or someplace with western character names. What's stopping Japan from doing a live action version with Japanese actors? Nothing.

 Is this gonna be a remake of the the 90's GITS movie? Cuz, not sure if u guys remember but it was kinda...whats the word I'm looking for here...ah yes, bollocks. Cracking animation and its influence on pop culture, movies and anime are undeniable but kinda dull outside of some dope ass action scenes. Manga and spin-off series had way better plot, flow and depth. Also, you know the shell bit in the title? That refers to the outer shell to ones being, i.e the physical body. The Major can still be Japanese but have the appearance of a Jewish chick with a cracking arse and mediocre acting skills Scarlett Johan stylee and still be true to the source. Personally, feeling the Emily Blunt suggestion and also Jlaw. Yes shes in way 2 many franchises but she seems to have a near monopoly on kickass chicks who can actually act niche. Finally, Jeff mother****ing Goldblum as Batou plz. Perhaps Ron Pearlmen. Or Tom Hardy. He can just get a crew cut/mullet combo shut it. And Danial Day Lewis as voice of the Tachikoma. Obviously.
