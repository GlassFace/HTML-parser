 Pokemon X and Y
 Could have sworn there was a topic about this already, but whatever. Pokemon X and Y yatta yatta Sixth Gen yatta more Pokemon, you get the point. Brings "new: things like Fairy type Pokemon, the 18th type, and Flying Battles. Also really cool three-dee. Oh and Mega Evolutions: Want Mega Blaziken NAO. Completely unsubstantiated speculation time: Emphasis on the Third Generation Pokemon and Mega Evolution suggests Ruby and Sapphire Remakes. The colors chosen for X and Y box art also resembles colors for Ruby and Sapphire.

 There was a thread. No idea when the last post in it was, though. Probably months. No one cares. Anyway! Is the alleged fairy type confirmed, or is that still just what everyone is calling it? -- well, everyone that doesn't froth with rage at the sight or sound of people calling it fairy type. I hope it is, just to make those people even more irrationally angry than they already are. I don't really care if they remake the third gen of games. They were the least impressive and most forgettable, imo. And Blaziken was awful, I don't know why anyone would want a mega-evolved pile of fighting bird ****.

It is going to be strong against dragon types so pokemon like Salamance are a little less OP.

 I suppose that was necessary, since dragon types were only weak against one type other than its own, and only took 1/2 damage from most others. Hopefully another dragon type weakness will mean that more than just a handful of late game dragon types will be introduced this gen...now I'm just getting my hopes up for no reason. That's not happening. T^T

 Blaziken is kickass. Mega Blaziken is taking kickass and evolving it into more kickass. How can you go wrong with this? Also, the Pokemon Xerneas on the cover of X is confirmed to be a Fairy type. Pretty sure Yveltal, it's counterpart mascot is Dark/Flying. To be honest, I'm really enjoying some of the designs for these Pokemon. Noivern is pretty cool once you notice those giant green circles aren't its eyes. Xerneas is also pretty cool and Yveltal is definitely freaking awesome.

 My guess is Dark types will also be related to Fairy types in some way, seeing as the X legendary (Xerneas) is Fairy type while the Y legendary (Yveltal) is Dark/Flying. Only time will tell, though. Either way, I'm very excited. Been quite a while since I've been this excited over a Pokemon game. xD

It would be great if it had an evolved form, because that could look really slick. Now watch as they take a decent bat design and ruin it by making it this generation's zubat, and we get tired of it during the first few hours of the game, after having fought 500 of them.

 The Official artwork coming out for this game is awesome btw: Originally Posted by Struggler Nope, Blaziken is gay and wears bell bottoms. fak u storglur And yeah, noivern looks pretty cool.

Now watch as they take a decent bat design and ruin it by making it this generation's zubat, and we get tired of it during the first few hours of the game, after having fought 500 of them. Noivern is a Dragon/Flying Pokemon. No-i-vern. Say it fast and you can hear wyvern in the name, hence the wing/arm design.

 Yes, but half of its design is clearly based on a bat, and it's got half of "noise" right in its name. Also seems to be called a "sound wave pokemon." And apparently it's the first dual-type with flying as its primary type. Hrm, weird.

Yeah, the sound theme is undeniable, but what I'm saying is that I doubt it will be common because of the nature of Dragon types and rarity.

 So I wasn't really impressed enough to spring for anything after HG/SS, but X/Y seems to be shaping up into a great game. There seem to be some natural progressions (mega evolutions, "horde encounters," super training, photo spots in game etc. Then there are some things that are long overdue and I'm specifically talking about the "player search system." from pokemonxy.com: Connect and play with other Trainers at any time with the new Player Search System (PSS), which allows you to find other people playing Pokémon X and Pokémon Y! You'll connect to other players nearby or around the world through the Internet. You can even communicate with players you've never had any contact with before. All you need to do to communicate with other players on the PSS is to tap their icons. Then you can easily choose to trade or battle with them. That's not all the PSS can do, so look forward to more info on this exciting feature in the future! You're always connected to the world with the PSS! You can connect not only to players nearby, but also to players all around the world. Using the PSS, you can do a variety of things, starting with trading and battling Pokémon. But as you'll see, there's much more to the PSS! Sounds like they're expanding on the social aspects of the game which is fantastic. It'll be interesting to see how Nintendo handles an online system that allows players to interact with people they don't actually know. As a fan of the first couple of generations my questions are: 1.) How often will I run into the older pokemon generations? 2.) Will every pokemon be available to catch or trade with just these two games(X/Y)? (meaning that I don't have to own a copy of Pokemon:Pearl just to get a Glaceon) My problems with pokemon have been the neglect of the social experience, given what the game is about and our online capabilities, and having to either own every game or knowing someone who has the right equipment to actually catch/trade all the pokemon. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 I put 5 on them so far. I am planning to finish my reserves Thursday.

It seems like you'll find older Pokemon pretty often, since they no longer constrain themselves to 150 Pokemon Regional Dexes anymore. 2) You can actually get all of the Eevee evolutions before you get the National Pokedex. I'd also assume that you can obtain every Pokemon save for some Legendaries of older Generations within both X and Y without the need for older games, assuming there is any type of backwards compatibility.

As for me, I'm going with Fennekin. Even if they go for Fire/Fighting yet again, I've always gone for the fire starter. Of course, I'll probably switch it out for something else over time. Preferably Houndour.

 Mega Mewtwo X an Y. I like the way that they're aware of the whole X/Y chromosome thing and actively incorporate it into the game by making X look more masculine and Y look more feminine. They're also taking the opportunity that comes with introducing a new type and doing some shuffling around as far as resistances and whatnot go with some of the older types. Fire/Psychic will also be the typing behind the fire starter this time, which means it will wipe the floor with the last three Generations of Fire starters automatically. Also, Mega Garchomp. /shudders.
