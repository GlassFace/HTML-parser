 Which cheesy movies do you like and why?
 Demon City - ShinjukuThis may be unfair because in it's original language it's probably an alright use of your time but if it were only an english film then there's no doubt. This is one of the best comedies ever, the lines in this movie had me in stitches and I didn't even plan on watching this movie at the time I watched it. I had also watched "Wicked City" before it, now that's a whole nother matter.
