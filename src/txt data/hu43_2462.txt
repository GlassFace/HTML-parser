 I just noticed something... Did anyone notice the name of the island the ship girls were to take from the Abyssals in the third episode? They called it W Island. I realized that it is an allusion to Wake Island, fought by the Japanese and Americans in WWII. Need proof? W[ake] Island, and the unique cresent shape the island had in the anime and as well as in reality. Just felt like sharing a useless fact. ]^v^)/
