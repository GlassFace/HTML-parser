[Manga] Paper or Digital? Which do you prefer?
 I recently finished up watching the Bakuman series and got really fired up to start planning my own original "manga-inspired" work (not some crappy knock off that blends "American style" comics with manga style, seriously those need to stop being made). Though when I started to think about this while flipping through volumes one through four of Bakuman and skimming through some of my Shonen Jump magazines, I came across a funny thought. I later confirmed this to be an almost fear of mine now after seeing that Shonen Jump in the states has gone all digital. This makes sense in it costing less to not print the magazine and to lower the cost for consumers. Additionally, this shouldn't detract from the story and art of the manga at all. Even so, I guess I have a bias as a traditional illustrator, despite that I have equipment to create digital work. For me, there is no better feeling that being able to hold the story in your hand while flipping the pages, to smell of the paper that can take you back to your first manga book, and to feel the story under your finger tips. It's also a strain on my eyes to look at a computer screen for too long, it's more natural to look at something that light hits than to look at the light directly. With both of these points down, one being a objective view and the other a subjective feeling, I want to leave this general question to you all: Which do you prefer? Paper or digital manga? Even though it seems that digital is making big strides in being the powerhouse, I would hope that it doesn't bury what I would say to some of us is a vital part of how we came to love such a wonderful story telling medium.
