 New Story Idea - Page 3
 This idea has been bugging me for awhile so I feel as if I should at least tell you folks about it because I think it's a good idea and I have figured out a way to tell it. This will be a ghost romance story between a detective and a ghost. Unfortunately that's about it. I just know some of the key aspects of the story will involve and young girl as the ghost, and a veteran detective...the detective part I'm not even sure of either. But he buys some old home and ends up in a dream like world with this young ghost, but he doesn't realize this and at a point gets reality and this dream world mixed up. The story revolves around pages of a notebook too, that have been torn out of a diary. It's also going to be a mystery as well. Most of this story came from me watching this AMV. Just tell me what you think, and if I end up bugging myself more on this story, I may post a chapter or two when I get around to writing it, but my main focus is Luna so writing this may not come anytime soon. Possible titles of story so far: Paper Sheets Pages of a Diary Thanks for reading.
