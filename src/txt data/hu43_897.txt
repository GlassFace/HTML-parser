Assuming you've read a little through the thread, these past episode, It seems your interested. Just watch a few eps. From what I saw in the first episode was the main character is a wimp and I hate when guys are wimps, which is one main reason why I hated Deadman Wonderland and Future Diary. But I also hated it cause I predicted the death of that chick right from the beginning. It's not good story telling, that part at least, not the wimpy main character plus with the rape I still don't want to and that's why I want a review, to see if there are any good qualities to the show besides the craziness.
