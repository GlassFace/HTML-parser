Freaking pissed off at how annoying his attitude is as a journalist. Also, Avi Arad sucks.

It's also possible that he'll retakes his role in the film from Panther, but we may end up having the Spider-Man role of the Civil War comics split into two parts of some variety. It's possible that Marvel even filmed scenes that would work with the Spider-Man under the presumption that a deal might be possible before such scenes became essential. Well, technically, Spidey had a major role in the Civil War comic book, so this doesn't really comes as a surprise to me. It felt more strange to me, actually, when they shoe-horned in Panther back then.
