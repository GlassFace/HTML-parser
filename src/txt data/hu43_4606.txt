 Left Formatting Posts
 I am not sure what is going on, I can only guess some new codes are being written in, but I have notice that instead of using the full page for a post, everything gets squished to the left. Is this a permanent or will it be resolved? I don't think I need to add a screen shot but if I do, just tell me and I can show you. I'm also using chrome but I'm not sure if that has anything to do with everything squishing to the left. This issues isn't with every post but it's happening more often than not and I'd just like to know what's going on. Edited 1: The issue did so on this post XD. Edited 2: And it fixed itself after I re posted the edit.
