 Which genres use bright pastel colors?
 I've been watching b gata h kei (yamada's first time) and I really like the bright and cheery color pallet they use. It reminds me a lot of the style they used in survival game club and if her flag breaks now that I think of it. Is this mostly reserved to ROM-coms, slice of life and school anime's? Is there a special name for this style besides just pastel? Also do you like bright cheery art direction? Or do you like it more realistic?
