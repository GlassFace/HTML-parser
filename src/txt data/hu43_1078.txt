 Your Best Feature?
 This thread sounds obnoxiously selfish *facetable* But I'm going to give it a go! In your personal opinion, what is the best feature about you? Both physically and mentally. And why? I will have to think a bit before I come back and re-edit my own reply. 
 
 I'm A4's no.1 messed up person :3 Following Proto ofcourse. But physically... I'm stronger than my victims. Thats a good feature I guess.

 My best physical feature: I am a handsome, black man (I preferred to called a beautiful, black woman). I am getting myself into a better shape and feeling better about myself. Best mental feature: I am pretty smart. I need to apply my knowledge and common sense more often and use this 'blessed knowledge' and make something of myself, but I know if I apply what I have up there, then I could live a good, mostly happy life.

 100X *Facetable* There's a lot to choose from besides the great looks xD My eyes, I know there just plain black pupils but the simpler the better! Mentally>? I'm going with me being able to cope with stress? I'll change that later xD

 I have so much patience it's crazy. Physically a high pain tolerance. Got my wisdom teeth pulled and didn't complain much about pain 

 My way with words...and my sack. 
 I want to say my INT but socially, it really has become a liability instead, so thats no. Then I would say maybe I have some CHA? Since people seem comfortable around me in person. Physically, I dont have much STR but I might have some AGI since I can dance well, I think. PER would be my worst since I need glasses and I miss things too often. LUK would weird, I dont critical often but when I do I score big. Yes I havent had coffee yet. 
 I'd say my best personality feature is also my worst one, if that makes any sense. I find that I am nice to most people and it sometimes comes back to bite me in the ass in one form or another. I do this both online and offline and have made a huge effort to be less "too nice", ESPECIALLY online. A friend said to me recently that he was going to appoint someone to approve all of my friends online so that I don't have to go through so much BS with unhinged people. I think it's more that I will sit and listen to people's issues and give them advice, but while most people are cool to talk to, there is always one or two that are quite nuts, but don't show that side for several months. *sigh* As for physical features, I dunno. Not sure if I could point out anything that I'd call my best. Plenty of negative things I can say though. lol.

 Mentally? I'm generally really considerate and empathetic. I end up playing devils advocate pretty often, but this sort of makes me a buzz-kill and less fun to be around to certain people, and I end up coming off as a self-righteous goon to others. But I think I'm pretty good at nailing down and understanding social interaction. 
 
 Ah, physically I guess the best thing is that I am a very healthy person (like I have no injuries, allergies or intolerances for example). Mentally, that I am a carefree kind of person. I used to be someone who worried about everything and that made me so stressed out and really depressed at times, but I´ve changed. So I´m not stressed or unhappy anymore (^_^) 
 Mostly I m cheerful and nice, if that makes my best feature(s). I tend to be nice to others , some are exceptions. They may recognize themselves easily. .p Physical feature...maybe my hair. There are some other nice features, but somehow negative features outweigh the positive ones. :/ 
 Originally Posted by Elfa Physical feature...maybe my hair. There are some other nice features, but somehow negative features outweigh the positive ones. :/ Nah, you're wrong here. I think you're beautiful. ^^ As for me, I like my logical and problem solving abilities. I can also learn stuff very easily and have a quick grasp of new concepts. I'm also able to explain things clearly once I grasp a concept (or so I'm told) so I guess that's a great thing as well ^^' as for looks or body.. I think I'm average at best.. not really much special about me. 
"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.' " - Isaac Asimov 
 My inability to let your failures bring me down 
 I am easy to talk to. Not one of those meany heads who are passive aggressive or rude for unknown reasons. And I'm also not a follower, am very strong willed, and yet also open minded. To put it in one word, I'm radical ;] Physically- uhh.. well idk. I guess my hair? Its fluffy xP 
 Funny, my friends and I were talking today about how they hang out with me and they enjoy it but I'm an *******. And we basically came up with the idea that I'm the ******* of unity. I'm an ******* yet whenever my friends fight or I fight with friends I settle it down and everything's ok. Also, like I said; for some reason I'm enjoyable to hang out with. Thus, I am the ******* of unity. 
 Mentally: N/A Physically: Probably my panda like looks. 
 Nice guys are the reason you can't have guy friends. Sowy @Pass_the_M
 Personality wise, it would be my bubbly yet slightly tomboyish nature. I lean more on the bubbly side however. I am also very patient. I would have to be as I have many eccentric friends that can suck the life out of you if you worry too much. Physical attraction wise? I guess my looks. I am fairly confident of it.

 I'm probably too willing to help people. Sounds a bit dumb but I often become stuck because I'm always trying to do things for other people to make it easier for them. It's probably also a bad trait as I don't do much for myself and end up with these situations of, "Um what do I do now?"

 best physical features not drinking any coffee, alcohol, not smoking and i also stopped eating or drinking any sugar. Therefore my body doesnt need anything of this junk. Best mental feature i dont know, maybe i cant forget things but it has many disadvantages. 
 I used to drink tea instead of coffee, lately ive gotten back for some increase in metabo. but i should really stop taking more of it. Im glad I was able to stop smiking at an early age, and I barely drink anymore. I really need to eat less junk... and work on the physical. 
I am cute and i am amazing and fun, how can you hate me? how can you not like me really??? 
 Physical: I am a hot dude, just plain genes I guess. Women and the occasional gay dude have not let me forget since about 13. Mental: I'm the opposite of a technical minded person, I'm very very very right brained and proud. It's especially strange in my field, but that makes me more proud.
