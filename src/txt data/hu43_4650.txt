 Return of the Living ...damn puns I'm just no good at puns.
 Hey! I'm back after...what years? I missed it here but, it seems like the forum has changed a lot. Anyway, nice to meet you and nice to see you again. See any good horror movies lately? Annabelle was so awful.

 Welcome back, The King of Horrors! I agree with you about Annabelle... I guess the Conjuring was better than that one. No good horror films lately...

Thanks a bunch and yeah I thought since Annabelle was related to The Conjuring it would be good but, sadly it really flopped. Yeah, not much to write home about on the horror front yet. I heard of this movie Starry Eyed that is supposed to be really good. Plan to watch that soon.

 welcome! Sorry not a horror or gore buff myself. Freezing and queens blade and ikkitousen are about as gorey/bloody as I get - and that's just for the fanservice really. But actually freezing and queens blade have decent enough stories to watch it regardless of the 'extras'.

Perhaps we're two sides of a different coin because, it's very rare that I enjoy any ecchi anime.

 @king of horror - I'm sure there are plenty of action and comedy shows we can agree on. I've also expanded my experiences to include rom/rom com.

Oh I try not to limit myself. Psychological anime is actually my favorite. Psychological, Comedy, and I'd saaayyy Fantasy are my top three genres.

 I think you were the one recommending selector infected/spread wixoss in another thread a little while ago. I'd say that makes us closer than you know. I love the wixoss series. That was so emotional and had surprisingly good action too - for what seemed to be a little kids show on the superficial surface.

Wixoss is something else lol I hate that people compare it to Madoka when they are very different in a lot of ways. OMG! Welcome back *hugs* We have missed your crazy butt from around here! Omg Shannon it's nice to see a familiar face! *Hugs* I've missed you guys too!

 Well both heroines want to sacrifice themselves and change the world. There are plenty of similarities. That doesn't detract from the greatness of both series.

Yeah, not much to write home about on the horror front yet. I heard of this movie Starry Eyed that is supposed to be really good. Plan to watch that soon. I thought the same as you about Annabelle. Unfortunately, he went in another way. Never heard of Starry Eyed instead. When I have time (yeah, as if it were possible), I'll give it a shot. 
 I didn't even bother watching Annabelle. Conjuring was great, I agree. And don't even make me start on Ouija. Damn, I got carried away. Greetings friend. Be sure to have a great time posting and interacting with the community members. No good horror movies lately, sigh.

 I haven't seen any horror movies, but I've been on a quest for horror anime. So far no luck. Got any suggestions? Anyways, welcome back!

Corpse Party is the most horror like anime I've watched. It's not amazing or even great but, it's decent. If you're familiar with Visual Novels I suggest the Game instead. Otherwise there's Higurashi no Naka Koro ni, Boogiepop Phantom (kinda old some don't like it one of my favs ), and Shiki. Enjoy! Thanks for all the welcome backs everyone I kinda lost control of the thread lol! And my username is awesome, that's not nice. Sorry I don't know Japanese to the person who spoke Japanese. If I missed a question or something feel free to talk to me on my profile or whatever it is these days lol.
