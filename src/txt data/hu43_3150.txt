[Fantasy] Junketsu no Maria (Maria the Virgin Witch / Sorcière de gré, pucelle de force) - Page 2
 Maria the Virgin Witch (Japanese: 純潔のマリア Hepburn: Junketsu no Maria, subtitled Sorcière de gré, pucelle de force) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masayuki Ishikawa. Kodansha Comics USA licensed the manga and will released it in 2015. It will be adapted into an anime for the Winter 2015 season starting in January. Set in France during the Hundred Years' War, it follows Maria, who is one of the most powerful witches of her era. She intervenes against the warring nations by using her succubus and incubus familiars to manipulate the opposing factions, as well as large-scale illusions, all for the sake of helping the people and maintaining peace. As a result, she has gained the appreciation of several villagers and the hostility of the Church, which considers her a heretic. Yet Maria is still a virgin and her own familiars tease her about it. As news of her actions spreads, Archangel Michael focuses on Maria and rejects her interference in human affairs. After a direct confrontation, Michael ultimately decides that Maria will lose her magical powers if she loses her virginity and also forbids her from publicly using magic, sending an angel called Ezekiel to oversee this decree.
