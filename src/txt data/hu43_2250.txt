[General Discussion] what if we''re all in the matrix but don't know it?
 anyone ever think about stuff like this? I just got done watching the anime no. 6. I've been watching a lot of cyberpunk, and dystopian stuff. And reading up on philosophy a little. Its really strange when you think about how our world is basically run by people we never even met before. Its like we just see them on tv and read books about them. But what goes on behind the scenes you know its quite scary the possiblities when you really think about it. were taught to not talk to strangers when were little kids, but that's who runs our world strangers. Its like our fate is in the hands of complete strangers when you really think about it. and if there good or bad we don't know, we just have to base it all on TV appearances and stuff. like who decides what we learn in schools. I'm not a conspiracy theorist really I just keep an open mind and don't buy into anything to much really. I'm not for or against, because I just don't have enough facts. its almost like all we know for sure is what we have been conditioned to believe since birth. I had read in an article in discovery magazine that theirs a group of philosophers and I think scientists trying to figure out if we all really do live in the matrix, just like in the movie the matrix. Not trying to start a political debate really, just wondering if anyone else really ever thinks about stuff like this. more like an open minded discussion.

 Well I've taken pills of many different colors, but I'm not out yet. Maybe I just haven't found the right color yet.

 Yep. People do think about this kind of stuff all the time and throughout history. Descartes' meditations are sort of the most famous example. He's the guy who asked "how do I know I'm not dreaming" and also "how do I know some demon hasn't tricked me into thinking 2+2=4." For him, these skeptical questions were just tools for his philosophical program. He was trying to build a philosophy containing only that which was absolutely true. Some people think he only got as far as the famous "I think, therefore I am." Anyway, people have gotten PhD's writing 300 page theses on this sort of stuff. Every once in a while I'll revisit some of the classics of philosophy like Plato's dialogues or Descartes' meditations and I'm still surprised how much depth you can pull from these stories.

Dude that's really cool! I think public schools, should teach these sort of things you know? I didn't learn anything about this in high school.

 Hmmm...Maybe I'm forgetting. I think Descartes' might have actually asked something like "How do I know I'm not just a part of someone else's dream?" or maybe "How do I know everything hasn't always been a dream?" His explanation was basically that he perceived things like color and sound and if everything was just a dream, he couldn't have come up with those perceptions himself. There had to be a real world out there somewhere if there were things like color and sound.

 Yeah I'm gonna look into that guy... I'm getting a kindle so i'm going to try and see if I can find some books by him. If you type in "ghost in the shell philosphy" in on Google a Wikipedia page comes up with the ghost in the shell philosophy, I found that interesting too.

 I'm the kinda person who would usually find this kinda stuff nuts and overall stupid. But I can't say that here given that I've thought basically the exact same thing before. I honestly don't think it's the case, but you never know. 
 Well it can't be the matrix given you're asking this question and taking that line of thought as far as you have! But yeah, even stuff like Descartes ideas kinda fall apart for me from a meta perspective; that I can ask the question and consider whether or not I'm dreaming/am part of someone or something else's dream, would lead me to the conclusion that it isn't a dream. Either that or it's a sufficiently complex simulation that there'd be no meaning in differentiating it from real life. Especially given that this is all I know. Like, yeah, finding out some kind of objective truth about existence would be interesting but beyond slightly adjusting my perspective it wouldn't actually change anything. Comparing that to the matrix though, you're looking for some sort of sinister motivation behind the "dream" existing, which in turn would necessitate a need to escape the dream. Which seems terribly unrealistic and silly, to me anyway. 

 Guess its 2003 again then ne? 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 It is true that we do not know much about the people whom run the world. The world is actually ran but a small set of about a dozen or so family's and than branches off into sects or branches or whatever you wish to call it. These family's are the Illuminati. They change their names often through out history but they are the Rothschild, Rockefeller, Pretty much every family whom built America and whom is decedent of Royalty from Europe that still has relevant power and money. Think about it really. They own the banks The banks own the money AND the printers and facilities its printed on. The politicians can never possibly win an election if they do not have money and money given to them from the illuminati members or some other extra rich tycoon. Thus the Illuminati or the "banks and investors" whom give the Politicians Money own them. Thus they also control the worlds armies and politics. They also own the Media so they own the truth. They "want" to own the internet or secretly own the internet and keep pushing these sopa and tpp bills they know will never pass to keep us occupied thinking we have some control and freedom in order to distract us from whats really going on. They are very scary people and own everything and we do not know a single thing about them other than a name.

 I just finished Neon Genesis Evangelion, so I'm really not up to this red pill, blue pill, dream, reality **** right now. 
 Yeah what I started to think about today, is that conspiracy author david icke... who has gotten popular. He basically says that our world is run by blood drinking alien reptilians that shape shift into humans and have been here since the beginning of time controlling our planet. Its really out there. but when you think about he makes his money off these books and people believe him because theirs no way of knowing wether or not if hes right or he's wrong. These aliens could just shape shift into humans and never even leave there human form and go back into there true form and just communicate through text messaging. and if we test them for blood samples to see if they are really not human, then surely david icke would just say that the data was all staged, and in the end we just take the media's word for it, which he claims are all shape shifting repitilans too. Icke claims there evil, maybe there not maybe there peaceful. It would make a great movie, I guess he figured he could make more money with the idea just selling books and convincing people that it is one hundred percent true, when we have no way of knowing if it is. I don't buy into conspiracy theorys really though, and I've just been watching to many sci-fi animes and films. I've heard the government actually does hire like people who are these super smart people who make movies like invasion of the body snatchers and stuff, to like come up with ways to protect the country and stuff because they think of such strange ideas that no one could think of.

I can dig around on a few websites and find audited financial statements of the US Federal Reserve, the European central bank, the IMF, and probably the Bank of England if I looked. And we know what they're up to because of the way economics works. They couldn't undertake their activities at the scale they do without affecting some kind of financial market. The truth is much more mundane than you've been lead to believe.

 "ian the korean". I enjoyed your response the most lol. I wonder what would be the point of escaping? If that's all we know and ever did know!

Well that's just it, in a matrix scenario, there's a malevolent force at work, basically using/destroying humanity for it's own ends and essentially out of revenge against out species. Trying to imagine a situation like that actually existing, a planet so devastated and inhospitable for life, not to mention a standing enemy force much better equipped and prepared isn't exactly a great motivator to abandon the "life" you know. Especially one that already let's you experience everything you could want to experience in a much better environment. I get that whole independence/freedom angle that the rebellion pushed in the matrix, picking the pill and whatnot, but without a heroic savior like Neo, the entire thing falls apart terribly and the rebellion is crushed without a blink. And I mean, sure that's what makes the movie fun, you have a super hero show up in your time of need to lead and protect the rebel forces; a Luke Skywalker, so to speak. But it's also why it'd be absolutely insane to even consider "escaping" from a matrix-like situation, because no one like that exists or would exist. It's just wish fulfillment on a base level. Even in in a situation say, where the planet was devastated and some sort of virtual system was put in place to handle mankind in the interim until it was habitable again or something, so there is no malevolent force preventing escape, it'd still be utterly foolish to return ~just because~ out of some moral imperative or rebellious urge. Hell, another movie example that comes to mind is Wally, where mankind is essentially adrift in space because the Earth is no longer habitable, obviously more of a dystopian "paradise" compared to the matrix, but still a comfortable lifestyle of sorts where needs are adequately met. They obviously were capable of returning, but what if someone had started a rebellion on the ship and attempted to go back sooner, while the planet was unlivable? You just end up with a lot of blood on your hands to even get back and then likely wipe out folks trying to recolonize. And for what exactly? It's just like you asked yourself, what is it actually for? A personal sense of pride and accomplishment? Big ****ing deal, everyone's dead now. It's why concepts like survival need to be separated from the fantastic, because while it might be entertaining in movies or games or literature, to follow the adventures of some rebel hero, you yourself would not be that rebel hero in the first place and would not be benefiting anyone by trying to escape the safety net available. Granted, another great example that somewhat removes the hurdles associated with a virtual reality on the macro level and focuses on the individual is Inception. Literally being stuck inside your own mind or potentially within the mind of a small group of people, potentially multiple realities deep. But as with the main character at the end of the movie (maybe) and many other folks making use of those realities, it wasn't necessarily a negative experience. Sure it's escaping reality but who gets to decide whether it's right or wrong? I kinda think all of that should be obvious to a certain extent, and it's sort of off-topic from actually figuring out whether or not our reality is an objective, real one as opposed to a virtual figment or dream of some sort, or even whether or not we actually "exist." Though I feel like it doesn't hurt to look at the motivation behind those sorts of movies and concepts being so popular. 

 Yeah It definitely wouldn't be like in the movies! There would be no one like Neo to save us! That is a really good point. It wouldn't make for a good movie if he didn't escape the matrix and fight back. Its just that though a movie.

 This is our reality so what's the point of trying to read more into it then there is? And besides id be like cypher in the matrix. I don't think id really want to know the truth. Would you really want to be resistance fighter in a bleak depleated future? Its better to leave it as just a movie. Sent from my Eclipse-X using Tapatalk

Which seems terribly unrealistic and silly, to me anyway. You know, there's a real sense in which Descartes turned philosophy on its head with just asking this question. For a long, long time, Aristotle's philosophy dominated western thought and it relied pretty heavily on sensation and perceiving. When Descartes came along and posed this question "what if this is all a dream" it was kind of a tool to challenge the Aristotelian tradition. He just didn't want to be fooled by his senses. His answers are quite a bit more involved than what I've shared (for example there's quite a bit about how we know a candle that changes phases into hot wax is still the same stuff), but he basically wants us to rely on logic and on being able to mathematically model phenomena, like with the physics that was developing during his time over just plain sensing and perceiving. This is all pretty much just like what you've mentioned above with just asking the question and being able to run with the discussion to its logical conclusion proving it for you. It's better to rely on something like your own logic to get answers.

 Seeing this thread reminded me of something Zhuangzi supposedly said; "Once upon a time, I, Chuang Chou, dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was Chou. Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man." (≈389-286 B.C.E.) Soon after, the agreed upon interpretation was that Zhuangzi's dream startled him, until the point other butterflies accepted him & he acted as they did (due to his appearance). Their sensual pleasures and untroubled lives were shared, to the point that he enjoyed his life as a butterfly until the moment he awoke & was phased by reality. When he reflected on this, he realized that his waking life could be other butterfly's dreams. In regards to this thread, other butterfly's dream could refer to the idea of losing touch with your own senses &/or logic (up, down, left, right, moral, immoral, necessary, unnecessary, etc...), ∴ being tricked into thinking/believing something (though it differs from the Matrix scenario, in that there is no inherently malevolent entity, that would depend on the situation at hand). Note: I apologize if this seems less than relative to the topic at hand, though I tried make sure it was by not relying solely on the devout Taoist interpretation(s).
