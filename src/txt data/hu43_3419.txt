[Anime] Most complacent anime character?
 Anime forums i'm looking for an anime character who is most complacent with any situation he is in, almost bored with it. The only thing I can think of because i watched it so recently is the girl in blood + in the second episode. the character is almost willing to die it seems but handles things with relative ease. Any help would be appreciated and ill expand if i remember some more like this elusive character type.
