[Anime] What's With Japan And Incest?
 i've watched a ton of anime where incest plays a part in the overall plot. and not just anime; a lot of japanese movies (in particular pink films) and visual novels have incest themes, mostly between brother & sister. whats up with that? one thing I notice about western media is that it really hates to touch on themes of incest
