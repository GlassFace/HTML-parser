[Action] M3: Sono Kuroki Hagane / M3: Sono Kuroki Tetsu (M3 The Dark Metal)
 There is distorted, deep blackness everywhere. That place, in which blackness swallowed everything and took away everything, has become known as the Avidya Zone. Strange beings assume the very form of the despair and chaos of humanity. They are known by this name: Imashime. An expedition surveys the Avidya Zone which consumes human spirits. So, in the intricate intersection between the present in impending crisis and the destiny of the past... can eight boys and girls, assembled to confront the Imashime, find the bright future that lies before the Avidya Zone? This is a late-comer to the season, having just aired the first episode today!

 "On a starry night, they heard the song of a corpse." This anime seems deliciously dark so far! I'm looking forward to more!

 I feel like all the characters in this show seem dark. Like it makes me feel melancholy. hoho This is a show I will surely see through the end. Also I didn't know Mechas were involve until I actually watched it XD.

 I like the way they designed the mechas, though... They're not the humanoid robot kind walking on two legs... they drive on wheels and perform basic moves like you could reasonably imagine a machine of the future to be capable of. It's more like a "dark future" setting than mecha setting.

XD

 Yeah, we just saw that humanoid mecha in the last episode. Still loving the way they do it though. It's like a mix of supernatural and mecha... After the second episode I think this show is even darker than I thought in the first! Which is a good thing. I'm loving it! 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 Oh, and I am so loving that creepy hospital setting! I wish I was there myself with a camera and tripod. <3 Maamu is totally my favorite girl! :3 She kinda reminds me of Tomoko from Watamote, lol. xD And the ghost is back again...

 Unfortunately the anime is moving faster than needed which is odd since its projected to be a 24 episode series. This might be due to the staff figuring out that setting up the characters stories is not needed or they will reveal it later in the anime after people have dropped it. This anime has alot of potential and I really like the theme, I just wish that they would not set it up in a way which makes it appear that there are holes in the story. 
 Probably means that the story will become that involved.

 So I'm really starting to think that M3 is a much darker version of Valvrave... 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 I dropped the show after ep 2, I wasn't really hooked. Now I know it's foolish to do so, but I don't have the time to watch everything, ya know what I mean? What's the atmospheric gist of the show so far, someone's claiming it's darker than Valvrave...which was not extremely dark but simply tragic and emotionally unsettling, nothing to the length of something like Mirai Nikki imo. Is the mech action good? Are the characters, which seemed bland to me, actually intriguing? How about some feedback for a disgruntled view folks? 
 Originally Posted by Ned So I'm really starting to think that M3 is a much darker version of Valvrave... Ofc it is, why? Valvrave wasn't dark at all imo. It was just over the top crazy show that we all loved. There was something that made us want more of vvv after each episode and it was kinda the same here for M3 tho only with the recent episode. Originally Posted by Shmuser Name Are the characters, which seemed bland to me, actually intriguing?

Valvrave had some dark underlying themes but wasn't a dark show in itself. M3 on the other hand, puts it all the darkness on the surface. That's why it feels like a darker version of Valvrave to me, with the same theme of mechas drawing immense power at the cost of human sorrow, used by humanity to fight against the same power from which they are borne. Just what are the Corpses, which are attached to regrets in this world, and what are the Reapers, which have similar powers drawn from a person's psyche and past? I feel a similar theme in that as with the Valvraves which are powered by human memories.

 I'm not gonna lie, I'm only watching this coz Maeno Tomoaki is playing one of the characters. I dont really have an interest in at at the moment.

I've completely forgotten about the vvv taking your memories. I was over indulging on the surprises that vvv always have on the end of each episodes.

 Episode 4 I... can't even. A creepy, chilling mind****. I love it! And while we're talking about how awesome this anime is, let's give a moment to mention how wicked the Opening Theme song is! May'n produces some of the most incredible OPs. When Blood Lad came out, it was arguably my favorite OP of that season. I think Re:Remember is my favorite for this season! 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 Alright, I'll watch it. Seems like it's actually good...well, just finished ep four and I confess that the series isn't really grabbing my attention. It's not very interesting, and I really don't think any romance will be the factor to keep me hooked until the end. I'll give this to the next ep to completely drop it.

Oh btw, did I mention how the blonde chick seems to be the tragic punching bag of the series? 
 Well yeah there is certainly a one-sided crush going on there, but it is merely a root for jealousy. I think this series is too twisted for any normal romance to blossom. Especially the part at the end.  Spoiler The psychotic murderer is attracted to her infection and the corruption of her soul while she is trying to fight the inner turmoil of her dark thoughts which she doesn't want to accept as part of herself, but he makes her feel like she needs to accept it as who she is. No romance there... just a twisted meeting of sick individuals... :/

 PS, that scientist is worse than Heiko! And Maamu was so cute in that kuma hoodie, but I wish we got to see more of it... I'm always intrigued by her and feel every episode that she's not getting enough screentime, lol. She still reminds me of Tomoko from WataMote, lol. xD

I wonder how did they forget each other, that they have been together in the past. Was it just them growing up? Or do the admonitions/Lightless Realm have something to do with it?

 This week's episode was so chilling and sad! I really feel for Emiru... and our protagonist is one messed up kid, too!
