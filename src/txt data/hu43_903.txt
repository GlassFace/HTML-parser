[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Yeah man, no problem. The mechs in this show are definitely more of a plot device than just a tool, especially given the effect they have on their pilots. I think that's what you're going for with that anyway; they have more focus than something like the tanks in Girls und Panzer for sure.
