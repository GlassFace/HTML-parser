 Star Wars The Force Awakens
 I was wondering something. Does anybody else have a fear that the original cast will only have bit parts and cameos???? I wonder if they might just be in the first one of the new trilogy to sell the hype and then be brushed aside for cheap no namers? Though I think one of the standalone spinoffs is supposed to be about Han solo and a bounty hunter. So what about you?
