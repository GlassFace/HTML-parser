 1st Playthrough + No Walkthrough Do other players do this often?
 Unless it's puzzle games, I try to play though it on my own. And even then, I wait till I'm gonna flip s*it before I go to a walk through. Then with Touhou which is hard as hell to even get past the first maybe 2 levels, on easy, then I look up walk thoughts and watch how better people than I play the game.
