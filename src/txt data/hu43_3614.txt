 Character theme songs.
 Choose a character from any anime, and give them a theme song. It doesn't have to be an anime theme song, or even have lyrics as long as it suits them. Feel free to choose one that's already been done. I'll go with Kanda Sorata and "The Boy With A Thorn In His Side" By The Smiths.
