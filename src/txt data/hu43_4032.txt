 Chris Kyle-American Sniper
 I've seen one criticism for this movie was that it had no stance on anything, and that there was no real insight into how Kyle viewed things. Idk I don't mind if it doesn't have any political stance but if you want to make a movie about someone you have to present something morally conflicting about what he is doing. I like bradley cooper though.
