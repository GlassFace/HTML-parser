 Xbox One Discussion
 http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hub/reveal ^Got about 2.5 hours until it starts. I'll update OP after it's over. Figured some of you might be interested in this. Not much to update really... 8GB of ram, 500GB of on-board storage, Blu-ray, HDMI in-out, kinect 'upgrades'... So we now have a combination of the 360 and PS3, called the Xbox One.

 I've got to be honest here, the worldwide premier of Ghosts was well done. I didn't realize I was emotionally invested in it until it ended. The superior textures and lighting made it look like I was watching a movie unfold instead of seeing a game being played. At least they ended very strong. Nice.

 Well it revealed COD Ghosts and I'm not a fan of the series but that game looks badass and I shall get it for PC most likely. Hope my PC can run it...I hope it comes out on PC as well. But why call it XBox One...Anyway that's all I have to say.

 ^ I was confused, was wondering if you guys were making jokes about the first one or the new one.

 The software is pretty impressive, actually. The ability to run so many programs and switch between them seamlessly looks mighty handy. I like that you have essentially have picture-in-picture and the voice and gesture commands look snappy and responsive. The enormous emphasis on the cloud was encouraging, too. The name is absolutely baffling but otherwise I was happy with what I saw. 

 
 It looks ****ing awesome, but I'm probably not going to get it. I have a 360 right now but I'm moving on to PC gaming soon ^3^ Maybe I'll get the xbox one when its cheaper. By a lot. 
 Yea... I think I will stick with gaming on my PC where I can buy non over priced games through Steam. Plus my computer is has had almost all the the Xbox Ones features plus a lot more.... :P 

 oh great another great sh*t that I'm not gonna get . FUQ YOU microsoft It Looks sexy.

 Why is it called the Xbox One when it's the third in the console life cycle?

 Really disappointed with the abandoning of backward compatibility. I mean, would it really be that hard? Me thinks they're being *******s simply because they can be. But this looks twice as bad on them. This would be the second time they'd be abandoning backward compatibility. It looks sleek and otherwise smooth, but I think in the end for consumers, the price is either going to be its strength, or its achilles heel. Time will tell. And about the name; yeah it's a bit underwhelming and all. But maybe they were going after a theme like that Jet Li movie The One? Haha, like, in Highlander too. I'm surprised no one made a Highlander joke. "There can only be ONE!" --I never buy systems at launch. There's always some "bug" that needs to be worked out. I wait for the guinea pigs to buy into it first, and wait until the kinks are sorted out. I do this with all first gen tech.

 Just watching the Angry Joe Rant and he's pointed out a few key details: - No Backwards compatibility (Bye bye old games) - It's not always online BUT needs to connect to the internet every 24 hours in order to validate games that can be played - Any games that you share need a fee in order to work on other machines (On old games and new? Does that transfer ownership?) - The Kinect is BIGGER and more evil looking then before - It's a glorified TV remote with speech recognition To be honest I would much rather spend more money and get a really good gaming PC that is there for playing GAMES.

 Saw this: PS4 ・CPU: Jaguar 8 Core CPU @ 2.0GHz ・GPU: Radeon GPU @ 1.84TFLOPS ・Memory: 8GB GDDR5 @ 176GB/s ■Features: ・Backwards compatible with previous PS* games ・Can remote play on PSV ・PlayStation Eye ・Supposedly plays used games ・Est. price: $300-$500 ・Has a Share button! Xbox One ・CPU: Jaguar 8 Core CPU @ 1.6GHz ・GPU: D3D 11.1 GPU @ 1.2TFLOPS ・Memory: 8GB DDR3 @ 68GB/s ■Features: ・No backwards compatibility ・Now has Blu-ray & TV support, in the US at least ・Kinect ・Plays used games if you pay again ・Est. price: $300-$500 ・Has Windows 8! Gotta say, f*ck console games, I'm sticking with my PC games, I just need to keep upgrading it so I can play more and better games. I'm not sure Microsoft is even trying to make a good console anymore.

 If these rumors about the Xbox One are true I'm definitely not supporting Microsoft anymore, they honestly pissed me off with the things that they're trying to take away from the Xbox, not only will people be unhappy but they're also going to lose a plethora of customers, I myself would even be getting a PS4 if Microsoft doesn't get their act together.

Kinect 2.0 "It's rocket science stuff going on" Gaming on consoles is ****in dead, get a PC. I hope your are joking with that comment. This stuff is way overwhelming and Freaking Amazing and you are just jealous that your computer does not do half the things the Xbox will. Which btw will probably be somewhat closer to fully inter grading with the PC itself. The future is getting closer and computers and consoles will soon be one. Soon your Phone, T.V, Internet, PC, Console, and everything in your house will be a single device and this is bringing us closer to that. I am so excited about this I have completely abandoned the PS4 as a option for my next gen gaming. Call of duty looks good actually. I have not liked it since the first one. I might actually play this. Story looks amazing.

 ^^ What? What part of it was freaking amazing? You can do all of that on your PC. You already do have a home entertainment system and you are posting on it RIGHT NOW. Im pretty sure you even have windows 8 so you can already do all this **** PLUS MORE. At least PS4 is way more powerful and you wont have to have it "connected to the internet every 24hours" or pay for online features. Oh not to mention that you can BRING A GAME YOU OWN TO SOMEONE ELSES PS4 AND PLAY IT WITHOUT PAYING. Come on Shadow Fox, give it up.  Spoiler best video. Edit: Also, my computer CAN do all of that. Voice commands can be used on windows 8 with speech recognition. And I can load up any app that they showed, play games that look better, and play any game I want on steam without having to pay a fee to use their "servers" that they are so proud of.
