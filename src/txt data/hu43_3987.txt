 Hey guys, for the record, I spoke to this guy on 24th January. It wasn't overlooked. This post was made on 21st and I didn't see it, but I removed others. I offered him the chance to change his name and remove the advertising stuff from his profile since he was actually contributing to discussions otherwise. Since that day, he hasn't returned. If you guys see any more historic posts, just drop me a PM and I will remove them. I can't do anything about the stuff on his profile, even if I ban the account. I don't have the power to edit anything but usernames, sigs and avatars. If he returns and doesn't remove the advertising/continues to advertise, then he will be banned then. Just wanted to let you guys know that.
