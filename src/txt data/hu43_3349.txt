 Hello
 Hello everyone. I just joined the forums a few minutes ago. I'm into a lot of anime but my favorite genres are psychological, slice of life and comedy. My favorite all time anime is Serial Experiments Lain. If you want to know more about me just check out my profile. I joined so I could converse with other anime fans.
