[Action] Hajime no Ippo Season 3
 http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news...nime-green-lit This year's 34th issue Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine is revealing on Wednesday that a third season of the television anime adaptation of George Morikawa's Hajime no Ippo (Fighting Spirit) manga has been green-lit. The anime is scheduled to begin airing this fall in Japan. The announcement image reads, “Ippo fights the formidable enemy, Sawamura! Dempsey breaks down!?” So apparently a season 3 has been confirmed and it will be airing this fall! I'm super excited for this as I've been waiting pretty much years after "New Challenger" Season 3 will be Ippo's challenge it seems. brb changing my name back to Takemura

 So this should cover Kamogawa's flashback right? At least that'll be worth watching.

 I can't remember the last time I was so exited for an upcoming anime 

 What's so great about this anime....like it seems good for a boxing anime but like what really makes it so great.

It's a simple story but the execution is really good. The fights themselves are really detailed and filled with tension. Huge cast of characters and it's hard to hate any of em. It is a true underdog story which makes it easy to root for the main character, and it manages to really get me pumped up lol

 Yeah I wasn't sure how well this fight would translate to the anime, but it was pretty great. Felt like it was dragging a little after the commercial break, but then Aoki pulled out his new trick move. Just amazing.

Yeah, I don't want to spoil too much for the people that still have to watch the episode. The new move is something you would never expect really. for a second I thought it was going to be something super strong.

 I love how the entire tone of the show changes just for Aoki's match. Ippo's a funny show already but they pulled out all the stops, right down to the corny music. Speakin' of, my favorite tune of the show re-appeared during this episode. 

 The 3rd opening was actually my least favorite of the 3 from the original series. These episodes focusing on Aoki have been hilarious. Ippo is not disappointing so far.

 I'm not too thrilled about Ippo's latest opponent. He's so evil it's silly.
