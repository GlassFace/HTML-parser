 Anime Recommendations Please - What made you think WOW! That was BRILLIANT!
 I am REALLY in the mood to watch anime right now, But I'm not too sure what to watch.. I have recently finished 2 anime and I am waiting for other to release weekly, I'm currently re-watching a few as well but I want to watch something New.. What would you recomend that made you think.. WOW! Would Prefer some shorter anime, but If it's long i'm Not too bothered, Watched all of Bleach, Naruto, Fairy Tail (twice) and currently re-watching these 3 as well. I'm not looking for any specific genre either, Just something that made you think WOW! This is amazing (or something like that). My list here of what I have watched (that I remember), http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Nar...how=0&order=12 Thanks =-]
