 League of Legends - Page 393
 A game only lasts that long if someone threw. Because at past 30~ minutes winning one fight is enough time to push and start knocking down base turrets. The games that last that long are always the ones where it takes an Ace just to get inner or inhib turrets because people have no concept of how to push with minions or if they're strong enough to win a 4v3/3v2/etc. Once people start getting their level 18 respawn times you only need a 1-2 man advantage to take Baron or Bases. And at 30-40~ minutes those opportunities would have presented themselves for both teams a dozen times over. That's why I hate long ass game because them lasting that long means one (or both) teams have players who simply don't understand how they should be using their 40+ seconds or free time when an opponent dies and you get an advantage.

 You know who I only recently found out was a damn good Nid player? Wildturtle. Obviously he's a great player in general, but I hadn't seen him play anything but adc until I started watching him stream within the last couple weeks. He's amazing with her; so fast, with instantaneous response time; auto attacks and spears going in all directions, in and out of cat form nonstop, heals just at the right time; he's surprisingly good with her. I should start using Nid, even though I hate her. Varus is probably my best adc, and I rarely miss my q's with him (though obviously it can go through minions so it's a little different), so I think I could become decent with her if I practiced enough. I'm just not terribly fond of mid lane, and ad Nid top is a little...meh. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

I'm just not terribly fond of mid lane, and ad Nid top is a little...meh. Trust me a good Nid player can be massively effective. I suck, but at a lower level if you land 2-3 spears before a team fight all they will do is retreat. If you have a tank that enemies hate to tower dive like Renekton or Nasus to split push (tele helps) and a Nidalee to hold off the enemy team in lane paired with say Ezreal, Jarven/Elise, Leona/Janna you can hold off an enemy team pretty damn well. I went through an entire game without losing a turret despite being roughly even in kills and cs. Against an experienced team it doesn't work as well, but has a very similar effect when done properly. 

 Always had a hard time figuring out how nid is viable in teamfights but that guy is insanely good. It's crazy that she has entire skill kit with no mana cost whatsoever. Easily one of the funnest champs to play along with Lee sin. Morgana mid op right now. Syndra too from what I'm seeing cuz she keeps getting buffed.

Easily one of the funnest champs to play along with Lee sin. Morgana mid op right now. Syndra too from what I'm seeing cuz she keeps getting buffed. Actually her mana costs are the only thing that keeps her weak pre-6 and still somewhat till she gets Tear at least. I also get Athene's to keep my mana up, add resists and CDRs. I think Athene's may actually be underpriced for all the bonuses it gets. Some people prefer a Morellonomicon, but it doesn't have MR which means you can out-duel most AP mids. 

 2 games 2 trolls. I hate Season 4 already. Riot can go and die in a shallow grave so that they can be dug up by the Koreans for the national championship. Bring back the Elo system already. 

 And this is what happens when I get an actual decent computer, good games, sure I have like, 2 bad games, aside that tf game because I kept lagging and throwing my Q's around and getting kills out of the blue, I like, wrecked balls, I also got a Penta on the Quinn game, legit destroyed them in seconds.  Spoiler
