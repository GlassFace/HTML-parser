 Spider-Man Finally Joins the MCU

Though, that's a pretty epic monologue, so they may save it for a proper teaser trailer, rather than just a post-credits scene. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
