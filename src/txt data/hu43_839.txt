[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Yeah this isn't looking very good. Gundam Seed with an even less inspired cast and plot, and less explanation. The only thing that's at all interesting is the weird ass laser vampirism crap after the credits.
