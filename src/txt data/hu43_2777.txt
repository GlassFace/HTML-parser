[General Discussion] What was your first job?
 So last month I got my first job and I'm quitting already because school is starting. But I just wanted to see what other people had as their first jobs and see whether they liked it or not. -- My first job was an impact at Hollister Co. (Don't laugh lol). And personally I found it very tiring (probably because I'm weak as heck) and minimum wage is definitely not enough. :P I must say it was an enjoyable experience even though I got tired a lot and the music was quite repetitive.
