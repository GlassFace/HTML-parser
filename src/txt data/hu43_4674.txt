 #BlackLivesMatter Dartmouth College Course
 Source:http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/04/living...-lives-matter/ It's just a college course that just looks at racial history of African Americans, connects them to events like Ferguson, and looks at black activism. In my opinion this should have never been created, because this will further emphasize that only black lives matter when it comes to issues like this. A college student a while back was scrutinized because she claimed all lives matter when faced with injustice with police officers, and wrongfully apologized thus creation of #onlybalcklivesmatter. 
 Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide. *Bill The Butcher - Gangs Of New York*
