 SAO Controversy, why?
 So, it is hard to see an anime conversation online without somebody slamming SAO, it seems to take TONS of hate. What I would like to discuss is, is it really that bad? I mean, sure, I did think that it was a bit weak in some parts, (Sorry Yoda ,) but, it didn't deserve at all the hate it gets. I think people are getting way to worked up about an anime that wasn't that bad.
