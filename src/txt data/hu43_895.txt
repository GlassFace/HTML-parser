[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires

As for Shoko I feel bad for her because they both had mutual feelings for each other but I also believe Haruto didn't choose Rukino out of pity because I think he to had feelings for her as she did him. On a side note L-elf is badass regardless lol To anyone, is this anime really any good or just crazy as f*ck, cause if it's just crazy I rather not pick up the anime again. How's the story, is there anything to it? Oh, and is the main character still a wimp, if he is then no matter how good the story is I won't be picking it up. I only saw the first episode and he was a wimp there so if that has continued well into the 12th episode I won't pick it up.
