 New to anime
 Shadow skill(It's based a lot on Roman Gladiators, and the main char is female) Hero Tales is downright godly for a anime so short(only 26 ep, It's complete, and fits the size perfectly) Zero no Tsukaima(only the 1st season is dubbed, but don't watch it dubbed anyway, because the dub is atrocious, watch the sub) Inuyasha+Inuyasha the Final Act(don't watch DBZ, what a atrociously bad anime, watch this masterpiece instead, there so many great aspects about it, that even to this dave, haven't been beaten or even matched). Yea Shaman King is pretty good too Keep watching Yu Yu Hakusho Go to Crunchyroll.com, and watch Yona of the dawn(main char is female, and omg is it a awesome series. Byfar the best anime in the past couple of years) 
 [IMG][/IMG] It probally wouldn't be a good idea to get on Qiang Lei's bad side.
