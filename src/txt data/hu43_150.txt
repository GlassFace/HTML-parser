 U kiss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 ok! theres this kind of new korean boy group called Ukiss- you guys should seriously check them out. Yeah, at first i thought they were pretty gay, too.but thir music vid for Not Young has some good dancing! Bingeul Bingeul is pretty cool, as well as their latest hit MAn MAn Ha Ni. Theyre members are pretty chill, too. Kevin Woo, the dude with the ponytail, is really a nice person. We're trying to make them more popular, because of the drama and crap happening with 2pm and all that mess >< so yeeah! give em a chance and support them!!! please?????? 
thanks to Lady_Shesshomaru^^ JOIN THEk-pop fan group
