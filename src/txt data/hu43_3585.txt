 Vegeta vs Hulk!

Green Scar Hulk and Majin Vegeta, or SSJ4 if you'd like to include GT, but it would likely just be detrimental to the Pro-Vegeta argument with GT's major inconsistencies and lack of supporting evidence for much of anything aside from said inconsistencies. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
