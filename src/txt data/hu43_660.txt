 I'm supposed to read stuff now? What is this, read forums.com? Anyway, the animation looks pretty snazzy in that trailer thing. Might give it the ole 4 episode treatment. I'm watching like 3 series. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 This new series predates Stand Alone Complex by 3 years so technically it's a prequel. Part of the plot has to do with Matoko meeting Batou for the first time and him thinking that she is a criminal. Plus she just seems to be acting like a younger, much less confident version of Matoko in that trailer. I get the distinct impression that she's less experienced but still fully capable of messing people up. I've been holding off on commenting on all the changes, especially with the character designs and everything. I don't think I hate them as much as everyone else, the silhouettes are good and distinctive and I can see the "younger" part of their designs. The music is pretty jarring, though. But it also kind of fits with the more youthful feel of the series as a whole. I prefer the English cast personally but nothing about the Japanese cast strikes me as flat-out wrong or anything. Interestingly, Maaya Sakamoto, the lady taking over Matoko, actually plays the younger Matoko in the original SAC series. Seems to fit pretty damn well to me. As usual the animation looks goddamn amazing. I'm pretty excited for this. 

 It does look pretty interesting. I had hoped that it was A sequel to Stand Alone Complex though.

 I've seen all of them, so when I get my hands on it, I will watch it. I originally thought/read this was supposed to be a prequel to things. So its a continuation then. 
I am cute and i am amazing and fun, how can you hate me? how can you not like me really???

 I like the direction they're taking with this. I'm excited to see a younger Motoko kicking ass. She seems to be more... emotional? than her older counterpart, which could lead to some great moments. I honestly can't wait, and I'm expecting nothing less than a solid show.

 I'm actually really looking forward to seeing how younger, more impulsive versions of the characters we all know and love might fair with everything around them. The Major and friends were, quite appropriately, as precise and meticulous as machines throughout the series thus far. Seeing them learn how to become those people could be really interesting. 

 Yeah the greater focus on actiony bits and whatnot makes me think it's gonna be a bit less cerebral and more impulsive like you're saying, which could be pretty neat!

We could discuss several themes in the ghost in the shell series that it implies thought now that you mention it. it's usually said it's inspired by blade runner. @ian more impulsiveness I think is better for a change or both ! 
 I'm still hoping for the GitS-style "slow" episodes, maybe as a kind of pre-amble to the great ones we already have in SAC and SAC2. You know, those episodes where everyone just sits down and talks about everything they've learned so far about the grand scheme and you can see who believes what and why. In SAC this was episode 9, appropriately subtitled "CHAT! CHAT! CHAT!". This was the episode where the Major logs into a chat room and discusses the Laughing Man case with a bunch of random internet folk. It was great to see characters try to sort out a big mystery and make little incremental steps as they argue about the specifics. I love episodes like this and I hope there's at least one in this new series.

Considering how dialogue-heavy GITS is, there's a decent chance, but I've still got my fingers crossed. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 The first 8 minutes of the show is available. Turn on closed caption for subzzz 

 ^ Well after that enlightening video I may watch this series. I've never been a fan of the other two so this may get me into it.

 Wow it looks great! Same sort of atmosphere and feeling I got from the old GiTS:SAC series. I like how much more emotive Motoko seems in this and just how expressive she is in general; actually talking and giving some tonal inflection in her responses that obviously reveal how she feels about whatever it is. It fits really well given how much younger and inexperienced she is here. Also digging the new hairstyle, it feels more utilitarian and closer to what I'd expect of someone still in the military compared to her look in SAC. 

 I want this episode so bad. The Major is kickass.

 That was some great action sequence there for a bit. Everything about this looks promising and awesome. The chief is still smart though he always comes off as pretentious. can't wait for full episode. 
 The full episode is out subbed. It definitely shows her being more vulnerable and wet behind the ears prior to joining Section 9. But she still has her kick ass abilities. I do prefer seeing her more mature appearance then this younger appearance. Maybe the next parts will show her getting a new cybernetic body.

 Goddamnit, it's a four episode OAV. I wanted a 26 episode series. AT least the episodes are 50 minutes long, so when it's all finished airing it'll be the equivalent of a 12 episode series. My face when it's not a prequel either. None of this is technically canon. It's a re-imagining.

 Alright! Second episode! I'm glad each part has its own self contained plot. It makes it easier to wait six months between airtimes. And with the second one, it's pretty obvious that this is not a prequel, but an alternate retelling.
