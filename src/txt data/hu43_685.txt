[Sci-Fi] Only mah railgun (To aru Kagaku no Railgun S)
 The second season will focus on The Sisters Arc. Lasting only a single volume in the Toaru Majutsu no Index light novels, it was later expanded greatly in the Toaru Kagaku no Railgun manga. The arc focuses on the ordeals of Mikoto Misaka after discovering the existence of the Radio Noise sisters that are being used in the Level 6 Shift, an experiment where they are killed in order for the highest-ranking Level 5, Accelerator, can achieve Level 6. (Source: Wikipedia) http://myanimelist.net/anime/16049/T...u_no_Railgun_S It would be high treason if anyone did not know or follow this new season. So I wanted to make sure I leave this thread here to serve as a reminder.

 2 months is so long to wait, I might die. Worth noting: all the major staff is being kept the same, and THE MUSICAL GENIUS FRIPSIDE gets another chance to make a masterpiece OP. ONLY MY RAILGUN CAN SHOOT IT. 

 I love this series! Can't wait.

 Is watching Index and S1 Railgun a prerequisite ? Other than that, ill prolly have a look at it, given that real life doesn't interfere to much.

 Index was a fun series, but you could probably skip it if it really doesn't appeal to you. You might be kind of lost when it comes to the characters and setting though. Jumping into season 2 of Railgun without watching the first would probably be even more confusing. 

 I never heard of the first season until this thread, but it looks really good!

I would recommend watching season 1 of Railgun first, simply because it's awesome and worth watching. Usually Railgun plot arcs are pretty self-contained, but it would be a good idea to get a feel for the world and characters going in. I definitely think that you should be able to get by without watching Index though. I've watched Railgun twice and read the manga, but I've never been able to get more than a few episodes into either season of Index. Despite sharing a setting and some characters, they aren't really the same genre and their focus is different. I don't think that skipping Index has hurt my enjoyment of Railgun at all. So in my experience Index is not a prerequisite. 

 The second season will focus on The Sisters Arc. Lasting only a single volume in the To aru Majutsu no Index light novels, it was later expanded greatly in the To aru Kagaku no Railgun manga. The arc focuses on the ordeals of Mikoto Misaka after discovering the existence of the Radio Noise sisters that are being used in the Level 6 Shift, an experiment where they are killed in order for the highest-ranking Level 5, Accelerator, can achieve Level 6. Raw has just been released, probably later tonight we'll see the first subbed of this. I'm looking forward to and will probably watch it along side Chihayafuru. A lot of great animes this season and not so great, I hope this second season is as good as the first.

 I am quite excited for this. Especially since it is taking place during my favorite arc in Index.

 REAL FANS HYPE TWO MONTHS IN ADVANCE duh 

 Originally Posted by Lu The Great Space Pirate HELLO MO ARE YOU EVEN TRYING?! http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...ly-mah-railgun I would post there but I didn't understand the title meant this anime. ____ Never a dull moment in this anime either, it was as epic as ever and I expect great things from this season. Although I hate the characters from Index. I wish they wouldn't show themselves but they already have. Not sure why but if I am a fanboy for anything it would be toward Railgun...now sure of her name, I've just always refereed to her as that. This anime has a strange feeling about it that even if it was bad I'd still love...I mean the first season didn't have a real good plot to it and I'm not expecting anything great from season 2 but I'm hyped either way.

 Season 2 is going to be depression city since it's the Misaka Sisters arc. 

 Really disappointed in the adaptation so far. The extra, pointless fanservice crap with Saten, Uihara, and Harue is really bogging everything down, I have no idea how they'll actually cover everything at this rate. They totally ruined the tea scene too: (manga spoilers) http://imgur.com/a/p73YY 

 How they're portraying the clone in the anime doesn't reflect how that scene is so it's out of place and I see why they wouldn't have it. Glad we're going to see how the two react next.

 The adaptation is pretty disappointing so far. There's just too much filler right now at 4 episodes in. Is it going to be just 13?

 Slated for 24 according to wikipedia, but even so there's so much better material they could be using. Oh well. I'm sure replacing plot-oriented scenes with fanservice and slice of life stuff helps keep it popular. :< 

 Heh, not bad today. I was worried more of that filler would continue for another episode. Hell, for the first half of this episode they seemed like they weren't ready to change direction.

 The slice of life stuff helps us feel more for the characters so it works and it's not just to keep it popular, it's always been popular. Gotta say, I'd be pissed. I am looking forward to the next episode. Can't say I remember the last time I looked forward to something so much. Edited: Anyone think of Star Wars or some other epic movie anthem at the end of the most recent episode? Felt out of place to me cause it distracted me of the epicness of the end of the episode.

 Episode 10, they add in that s*itty guy from Index...I hope his roll is to a minimal in this season.
