[Fantasy] Kyoukai no Kanata (Beyond the Boundary)
 This show will probably be top 3 fall for me. I enjoyed both episodes so far as they were both action packed. I like most of the characters and the story is pretty cool so far. Action and a good laugh here and there, I am set with this Anime :3 Looking forward to more episodes.
