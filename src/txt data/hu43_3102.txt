[Manga] What do you think are the best harem anime?
 Depends on what you consider a harem anime Type 1: The girls, at least 3 or more, in love with one boy Type 2: Just a multitude of girls and maybe 1 lead male character. Thus, Ramna 1/2, Rosario + Vampire, Da Capo 1 and Infinite Stratos are the best Harem type animes, along with maybe Maburaho. Type 2 Ah! My Buddha, not all those girls wanted the lead male, Sister Princess- they are Wataru's sisters for petes sake!, To Love Ru, maybe a girl or two wanted Rito, like Momo.
