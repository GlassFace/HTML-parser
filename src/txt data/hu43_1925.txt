 Hi guys :D
 Hello guys I always hate the Introduction part specially on school. .___. I don't know Maybe I'm really bad at introducing myself . some of you might relate on me haha I'm "PrankenCheese" First I decided to name myself "Cheesetits" But I think It kinda' Offensive So I made it "PrankenCheese" .. Yeah yeah . I know, I know . Wakata wakata. I suck at naming. I always encounter this problems when creating a Good character name in game,Because I'm also a Gamer. I love playing MMORPG/RPG/FPS/TPS and any other adventure games. It's my second time joining to a awesome forum like this. I think It's been a years since I last joined on last forum and that forum is all about Monster-Hunter . Yeah I'm a big fan of monster hunter ( MHP3/MHU/MHF etc etc. ). But I never finish it because I broke my freagin' PSP . I also have a problem in my Romance Story Line IRL and it turns out into a drama. My hobby is playing games, reading manga , watching anime and talking to the girl that dumped me ,____, But She now only Exist in my memory because She Changed ALOT. I don't know what I'm Saying this I'm such a loner. I joined this group because I want to feel comfortable again and to make friends I hope you guys can help me

Hello, D Morning Star Thanks for the warm greeting Right now I'm not playing anything because I screwed up most of my consoles hahaha . but sometimes I play online games in my pc Such as grand chase,elsword,adventure quest worlds etc etc. and I'm still stuck at playing Disgaea:Hour of darkness on my DS . Its a tactical turn based rpg and its really fun to play. I hope someday my psp works fine so I can play other disgaea series.
