 Favorite Mecha/Battlesuit!!! - Page 2
 What are your favorite mecha battlesuits and why? The choices don't have to be based on what's the most powerful like who would win in a battle, well it can if that's your criteria but it could be also because of the design being artistically cool or realistic in how it functions or maybe its special abilities or cool technology. Also, please use spoiler links for really large high-resolution pictures. Don't want us to get in trouble with the mods.
