[Manga] What would you consider a "legendary" anime/manga?
 I wouldn't consider Pokemon to be legendary status considering it's most popular medium is as a video game, then card game, then show. Not only that but there is really no canon storyline. I think DB can be considered legendary, however it's not a gold standard which a lot of people seem to think it is. Akira Toriyama is a manga pioneer and is still active on Shounen Jump's board to select award winners for new and old manga illustrators as well as has heavy influence within the company itself along with Oda (creator of One Piece). Anything after milestone series is all too opinionated to get into though, so I shall stop here.
