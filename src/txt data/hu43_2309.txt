 Gaff Occasionally Draws.
 Thank you It's mostly Photoshop that I use, although I sometimes use Manga Studio as well - different programs tend to lend themselves more readily to different styles. Hardware wise, I'm lucky enough to have a Wacom Cintiq, which is basically just a monitor that you can draw on, but it's an expensive bit of kit. So long as you're willing to put a bit of time into getting used to it though, you can still get equally good and better results from just a conventional graphics tablet - the basic Wacom Intuos ones are quite affordable and well worth picking up, if you fancy giving it a try.
