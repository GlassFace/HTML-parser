[Event] [Round 2] A4's Greatest Anti-hero: The Archangel vs. Shadow Fox vs. Scythe
 For our first contender, in a much anticipated fight between one heavyweight and two welter weights, but that doesn't matter. bigger fights have been lost before. The Archangel. Pure crass, and a dick to most. But that's just in his nature. He'll take you on from the front or back, with a sharp knife in their spine, or through their heart. And if you're a woman or a man, expect no less from this guy. He cuts down his enemies with no soft words. He will destroy you, even if you do decide to bribe him. It more than likely not work. But give it a try, and find out if your death is swifter than the other guy's, And #I'm the only anti-hero to ever cyber a dude. Shadow Fox, is our next contender. Paranoid as ****, and believes the world is controlled by the illuminati. Which he's probably apart of of. So bware. He probably has snipers watching you at the polling both. He's probably watching you now. Microsoft is out to get you, and Bill Gates controls all. The World Order has begun. And Shadow is in control of it. A vote for him is true nihilism and the reconstruction of an already broken world. Let the reconstruction begin, anew. Our third contender, Scythe.. With an ego bigger than his dick. He stands proud of his Scottish roots. A country that doesn't exist of course, but he's fighting for that to be the rebirth of his one true nation. Scotland the true, one nation that surpasses all of the UK. The British are scum, and soil at the bottom of his feet, and the feet of his brethren. Fight his cause,, and see the truth of the anti-hero cause... Rise up. FIGHT TH CAUSE. OF WILLIAM WALLACE! AND LETS ALL FIRE LIGHTNING BOLTS FROM OUR ASSES! 
Individual Eleven: Rise Up. Never conform. 
 Stole the first vote 
  Spoiler  Spoiler 
 I knew you were voting for Shadow Fox. I hope this one doesn't fall to the MsBloodyFallen Syndrome. 
Individual Eleven: Rise Up. Never conform. 
 I vote for Scythie! Arch may sound like Batman but Scythie has a scottish accent, so obviously that makes him more of a hero? lol 
 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses. Beside you as you like softly down, I will be until I hear the words "Checkmate". ~Sebastian Michaelis ~ Individual 4 ~ A4's Greatest Villain <Right Here Lmao 
 Go archie go!!!

 Saw I posted this in the wrong thing man, harshin my fun times doing that. The new world order is already here man. Just look at the SIIIGNS MAAAAN! The Patriot Act, NDAA, Taking away our guns. ARCHANGLE IS A PART OF THE ILLUMINATI MAN...Same with me when they see my usefullness! Just take a look at his Current Poll Results Man. 66.6 ....666..That is the mark of the Illuminated ones highest authority man! like, obvious signs out there for everything. Almost like they WANT us to find them. There are camps, thousands of them all around the U.S that is designed for containing people and are military institutes. Currently, all of them are empty. Why do you think I am planning on building my own armor proof super suit man! Gonna need an array of weapons too maaan. Like some rifles and a shotgun and some grenades and stuff man. In a few more years, it will be too late. 2021 man. That is THE YEAR of the ILLUMINATI MAN. And I ain't gonna go down like a thing man. If I show them I am ready to join them man, I can take a seat with them!

 Arch took one for the team when he cybered that dude. He is a hero and an example of what not to do on the internet. What a hero

 Arch would be great at deactivating traps. But Shadow = Dark Steel and the world cannot be denied high velocity shotguns. That would just be wrong. Hmmmmm. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Oh god I forgot about the high velocity shotguns! Dark Steel rises again!

 That's why I voted for Shadow Fox. Cuz when he pulls out that Dark Steel, people hit the floor. (whether in laughter or fear)

 Arch wins this on his doucheyness and username alone.

 Scythe sucks Nessa. ACCEPT IT!

 Scythe has eaten cat. No that wasn't a euphemism. Think he said something about feline great afterwards. Clearly a villian. Some of the things people confess to in chatbox. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 The Archangel advances. Nice try though, Scythe! (Yeah, not). You failed Scotland. Or did Scotland fail you? A conundrum to ponder. Elimination chart update coming soon.

 *punches random stranger* damn the poor Scottish will never prevail... lmao congrats batman!
