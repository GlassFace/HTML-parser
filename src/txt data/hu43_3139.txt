 Suggestions
 Alright this is gonna be a bit different than most but just looking for suggestions that arent all the first ones u say since ive probably already tried those (think this is my 4th post ive made in the past year so yea). I generally dont have too many problems finding stuff but I still dont know how people have lists for anime since I generally go through a lot of anime before i find something I really like. (although i have watched a lot of stuff to pass the time, long q times in league and ****... and league gets frustrating so ill watch whatever when i get a lot of retards on my team xd) but yea ill post my list and i know most of the people who will post back have given me stuff before and i still havent ordered my list sadly which i should since like 1/2 of the anime ive watched i probably wouldnt rewatch (im picky) http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Pannucci but yea ill try again and generally speaking the animes ive liked most are those like steins;gate, code geass, mirai nikki or on the side of like golden time and white album 2. I do watch the other stuff and will watch it if its pretty good but those tend to be the ones that leave a lasting impression. O and weird requirement but i generally dont like old animation like 2000 or before. I have problems playing old games too so its just the animation bothers me for some reason and generally if it isnt more fluid for lack of a better word like the past 10 years animation then i generally wont make it far at all if even past teh first ep (and yes ive tried many times its just something i havent ever been able to get past in an anime). But pretty much all animes are welcome minus reverse harem and sports (i watch a **** ton of sports as is so anime sports kinda dont work with me since id rather just watch the game in that case... ) Also if you verify why u put the anime on the list its helpful but definitely not required ill look if up if not but i have not ever watched an anime without at least looking up something about it before and probably never will (i hate going in completely blind since most of the time I have problems finding stuff i like anyways so it kinda saves me time to do so)
