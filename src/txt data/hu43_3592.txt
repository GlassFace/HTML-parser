 Vegeta vs Hulk!
 Anybody know the Vegeta vs Goku ssj2 fight powerlevels compared to ssj2 cell gohan? I think we can lightly relate cell to hulk because of regeneration right? So if ssj2 vegeta can output the kind of power than can kill cell, I think he would beat hulk. Where people say vegeta could not destroy planets, I seem to recall the final flash move he trained in the time chamber and then used against cell threatened to destroy the planet. Likewise with goku's IT kamehameha. They only didn't because they were directed away. I think we can assume that in the buu saga both goku and vegeta are more powerfull. Also, battle of the gods is canon, and when angered vegeta lays some hurt on the god of destruction. judging by the clip at the end before beerus sleeps, he can destroy things (planets) easier than anything in a comic book so if hulk punched bulma in the ovaries, vegeta would probably beat hulk senseless
