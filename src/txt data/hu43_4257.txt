 Where would you rather live?
 Talking about Japan, the funniest stuff I've asked to a Japanese guy who came to visit my place was: "Where would most of the Japanese rather live?". He said they would rather live in Italy, America, and Canada, but they know that would be difficult to be integrated... Just my two cents.
