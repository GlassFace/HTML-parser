 My return from the grave. Holy crap, where did five years go?
 Greetings, forum goers. I'd like to begin by formally apologizing to anyone who had the displeasure of interacting with me five years ago, because that's how long it has been since I've frequented this forum. My posts were all horrifically embarrassing, and I am deeply sorry. That being said: hi! I have no idea who is still here that was when I frequented, if anyone, and I honestly wouldn't know the difference either way because I have no clue who any of you are anymore. It took me thirty minutes just to find my username and reset my password. I thought about this forum a few days ago for the first time in quite a while, and discovered that I have no idea why I stopped coming here, and I had some time, so I thought I would drop a line and see if I can't get into this again. Thanks in advance for having me
