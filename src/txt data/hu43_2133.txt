[Action] Akame ga KILL! - Page 3
 Tatsumi is a fighter who sets off to the Capital in search of a way to make money to assist his poverty-stricken village, only to discover the deep corruption there. After falling victim to a robbery by a woman and losing all his money, Tatsumi is taken in by a noble aristocratic girl by the name of Aria. In the following night, Aria's place is attacked by a group of assassins known as Night Raid. While Tatsumi at first tries to defend Aria from the assassin Akame, another member of the group stops the fight. She reveals that Aria has kidnapped several villagers and tortures them for fun. Seeing potential in Tatsumi, Night Raid invites the boy to their group warning that regardless of how they want to assassinate corrupted people, they are murderers. Tatsumi accepts in order to become stronger and protect his village. As a result, Tatsumi starts training not only to become a better fighter but as well as cold assassin. The February issue of Gangan Joker magazine (home of Watamote's four panel spin-off, Dusk Maiden of Amnesia , Inu x Boku SS) is confirming Takahiro and Tetsuya Tashiro's 2010 nine volume, ongoing Akame ga KILL! is slated to become a TV anime. This manga is supposedly notoriously violent. More details here: http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-new...nime-confirmed And on Wiki here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akame_ga_Kill
