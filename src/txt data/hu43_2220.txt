 I rarely touch junk foods. I know how beneficial it is to keep your taste buds under control.

 I love it , but it costs too much where I live ... so I only eat it like once in 3-4 months ...

 Thrice weekly.

 I eat junk food about 2-3 times a month.

 I drink soda every day, so I guess every day ._. 

 I used to indulge everyday, then my body was all like "nope im gonna be sick all the time" so i eat clean now and exercise

 Don't know if this is supposed to be a genuine question or a troll advertisement. 10 posts and redirecting us to a boot camp? My veteran instincts say I should know better but I'll bite. I drink sodas and energy drinks but steer away from junk food for the most part.I love healthy food

 Hmm..being that my diet is mainly paleo, do not eat bread and pasta, i tend to stay away from process junk food as much as I can. BUT! the only bad food I eat is basically.... milk shakes and french fries from time to time. >_< Either than that, my diet is usually free of white bread and process stuff. I love my red meat, lean meats, and greens. ^_^

 If you mean things like takeaway, then very rarely. But things like chips and chocolate, then maybe a couple of days a week. When I go shopping I make sure to buy some kind of snack for anime/gaming time. :P

 Generally I have chips or something once or twice a week. I like almonds, cashews, and pistachios a lot though

Maybe if they're heavily salted or honey roasted or something though haha. I'm sorta the same though, I like to get corn chips, but that's 'cause I like to make fresh Guacamole or Salsa, or a nice bean dip to go with 'em. Probably twice a week or so yeah. So is that you in the photo there OP?

 I'm a very healthy person, & a big health enthusiast but I give myself a little treat almost daily. I would work out insanely every single day, but marching band season really kicked the crap out of me. When marching band season was over, I just decided not to do anything. I haven't really worked out recently but I still watch myself.

 I eat junk food once a month. 
 Well, I used to eat a lot back then but I realized that it was too much and bad thing, so I decided to stop, now I only eat it once in a month. 

 Probably a few times a week.

 I eat too much junk food...about three times a day.
