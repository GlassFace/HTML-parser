 ~Being honked at when I'm walking on the side of the street. That's very annoying and childish. ~When people keep staring at me, I usually raise my eyebrows at them and than they usually look away. ~People who bring something up and than say, "Oh nevermind... I can't tell you." Ugh! Than why did you bring it up for?! Err this really annoys me especially. ~When people pet me. I had a friend who did this to me constantly and I told them I was going to bite them if they continued to do it. They'd pet me as if I was a dog or cat. Everyone has limits and people should respect people's personal space. It's common sense, when someone says knock it off. Simply stop doing what you're doing. ~Whenever someone asks me a load of questions all at once. 
 
 my biggest pet peeve is when I'm talking to someone and they have to respond to a text, it just ruins the conversation like almost instantly 

 My Biggest pet Peeve IS when someone tells me I look sad/ or mad ( And really, it's just my resting face/ neutral face) and when I tell them I'm not, it's just my face, they say " WELL, CHANGE IT" or " NO, your sad!" or " NO, you're mad!" or " you'll look a lot better if you change it." I get this soo much, omg I want to kill someone every time i hear it. It's mostly from guys, and I wanna punch them every time I hear it.

I get this soo much, omg I want to kill someone every time i hear it. It's mostly from guys, and I wanna punch them every time I hear it. I got this today from some of my friends. I wanted to just deliver a nice hard knuckle puckle to their face, but I restrained my anger. And I wasn't even angry I just didn't feel like talking. 
 Hypocrisy. I cannot stand a hypocrite and I cant help but let them know that. It has gotten me into plenty of arguments but I cant let injustice be ignored.

Well, my pet peeve is a bit different from this. People always keep telling me that I've a grin pasted on my face although I'm not aware of it since I'm not thinking of anything funny. This bothers me a little.

 Some of my biggest pet peeves is being told that I look tired, or asked if I'm tired (which is similar to people pointing out and asking if you're sad/mad, ect) when I'm not. Another pet peeve of mine, especially when I was in high school, is when people just copy off of others work constantly. Like, why not just do the work yourself? You learn more that way. I also dislike when people have very loud conversations on their phone or play loud music on the trains. It gets very irritating after a while. (I'm not saying conversation or quiet phone conversations are bad, it's just when people talk very loudly when they're sitting/standing near lots of people, or play music loudly without headphones..) 

 -when someone doesn't participate for a group activities and they expect to get credit. -Also during practice for any sports team when a teammate doesn't try their hardest or they couldn't care about their team -Friends who keep bothering me for fun when I'm reading my book -People being loud in the library -Paying real money for items in games <------------------------BIGGEST PET PEEVE 
Fool me once shame on you fool me twice f*ck you Patches 
 Currently my greatest pet peeve is when someone proclaims that they are an “open minded person.” I just find so much wrong with this that my eyes swirl round to the back of my skull. With every few exceptions, everyone sees themselves as open minded individuals, just like most consider themselves to be reasonable good people. So going out of your way to verbalize it is kind of redundant.People think it’s a way to automatically win an argument. You might have even seen this kind of behavior on A4; two people go back and forth on an issue until someone plays the open minded card, therefore implying that the other user isn’t.It conveys that you don’t respect other people enough to come to their own conclusions in regards to your character.

 When people say "what's wrong with you?" when I am sitting there relaxed and minding my own business. I could be in a perfectly good mood, just sitting there with a neutral face and someone comes in and accuses me of being in a bad mood. That ****ing puts me in a bad mood. lol. People who do good deeds in order to get rewarded. What's the point in doing something nice if you are expecting it returned X10. I hate people like that. Either help because you want to, or stay at home because at the end of the day, there are often enough of honest willing people available to carry out the task. Haha, the above can apply to A4 too. But yeah, why not do nice things because they want to for the community, not because they want some silly status. People who act all whiteknight-like. In Ireland, we call a cigarette, a "fag." Most people know that. We have our culture, even if we are aware of the American meaning. Someone asked me not to use that word, and I was like "Are you for real? This isn't America, it's Ireland." Yeah, if you start to take on every meaning from every culture, you're going to be watching a lot of things. Tourists who go around wearing those stupid pouches around their waist that they'd never wear back home. LOL. I think they look ridiculous. Over-righteous Christians. It's not okay to think you're better than the next person. Enlightened Atheists. No, you don't have it all figured out, you're just as informed/misinformed as the one with the religion.
