[General Discussion] A4's groups
 Until recently, I hadn't payed much attention to the groups in the forum. But I'm getting curious as of late and I want to know about the groups here. I don't want their official descriptions because I could go look at them at any time I desire. I want to know how the users themselves view the groups, I'm particularly interested in seeing how you see the groups you are not a part of. Be creative; worst case scenario you will end up hating each other. Creating an internal power struggle borderline civil war for the control of A4. Let's keep our fingers crossed.

 I'm part of a few actually. Roleplayers, WSA, and the Elevens. I joined RP Society way earlier this year, primarily because I initially joined under the guise of roleplaying only. I honestly don't think I've posted there. I've posted a number of times in WSA. If you ever join, watch out for PIA. She's nuttier than squirrel ****, but pretty harmless. I branched out from the RP Realm, met more members, unified some prospects with some and made the Elevens. Apparently the Elevens are terrorists or something.

Apparently the Elevens are terrorists or something. I was invited (I don't know by who) and I joined. That's what sparked my curiosity about the groups. I plan to eventually take over A4, so I should learn as much from the elevens as I can. 

 I joined several groups here when I first came onto this forum (Just for the sake of it) and found that the groups were either pretty dead or just didn't peak my interests enough to post. I did look through many of them, and the one that I found most active at the time, was the WSA. I wasn't really compelled to post anything there, but I did read through several pages. Didn't really had an interest in the existing groups in general, and never really spent much time there, so, I actually left most of the groups that I had membership in. I did get invited to the Elevens a few months back and stuck with it since then, It's the only group so far on the forum that I've actually been active in.

 A4 has groups?! 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 I'm a member of both the Elevens and WSA. Joined out of curiosity. I still hang out in the WSA, for the sake of the founding members and for the group's future. We're in our 4th generation (according to PIA) I think

 I think we have less groups/cliques now than we ever did. Before, you had a bunch of people that knew each other in real life and kinda quoted each other all the time and had their own mini-discussions, the artfag crew - art section layabouts, the A4 Punk Foundation - these guys loved punk and hung out in the music forum. Basically hipsters. Hell, you had groups of people that would solely most in the tv/music section or ED/CE. It'd be same lot discussing the same sh1t. Actually, that last bit hasn't changed, lol. We than had a vets/F&G split that was quite toxic. Suppose there's more community and less hate now. And yeah, the social have been deader than the Band Of The Hawks for a while now. Doesn't help that most new users don't even know that place exists!

 That would consist of me passive aggressively yelling at everyone online, zero and gen occasionally humoring me, Tony popping in to drive by hate and watch Takera play with himself, Ian and the staff trying to bring some class to proceedings, Volk pretending he's old enough to drink and....yeah I could totally run that community.

 I think you've had your community all along, isn't it pretty much what it is now? 

 A4 groups are pretty lame....and just dead. I am part of a few..I think the martial arts group. Well all I can say is that A4's weak point is probably the groups and I think its just there to take up bandwidth.

 I join and leave groups. They seem a bit pointless and serve no significance to me - just small communities, I guess. If you want to get closer to people who share the same interest as you, find a group. 
 
 The groups were a great idea when we actually had updates for your groups on the forum index. vBulletin went and broke some **** though in their vB4 update. I dunno, some groups can be quite obnoxious, like the 11s when they were being ridiculous in the August chat thread. People actually got annoyed, reported it, and it may or may not have resulted in a couple of temporary site and chatbox bans. It's okay to have a theme like that and make jokes about it, but it's not okay to take over threads and be annoying. It just spreads ill feeling and asshattery. Yeah, I think the Vets vs F&G was possibly the worst thing to ever happen to A4. lol. It was just so divided and cliquey. It was so bad that when I became a mod, I lost a bunch of friends because according to them I had switched sides: newbie/chat thread regular to veteran. I really wouldn't like to see divides like that happen again. Silly forum contests and the like bring people together as we saw with Miss A4. It was stupid, but people we didn't know existed came out of the woodwork.

 Do you RP, or are you interested in learning? Join our Role Player's Society here on A4. Would you like a baseball bat to shove up your ass along with that stick? You're a mod, please act like one A4 is on FACEBOOK

 Yes and No. I was invited, but I have never participated. I didn't really get the idea of it to be honest. It sounded awesome in theory Besides, I don't have to be a member of a group to read it's content.

 Would still like to see this site have a Skype group, a place for those that have skype accounts to go and hang out together. it could work out pretty well for meeting new members or just getting to know those in the forums that much better!
