[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires

Why entertain a love story for a whole two seasons just to kill the main character off? It was definitely a waste of development. I loved the ending actually  Spoiler the fact that the anime didnt cater to the normal "good guy win and live happily ever after" cliche was refreshing. I do wish the relationship between Haruto and Shoko was finished a little with him choosing her or Saki but his death I feel was needed to solidify the story and act as the catalyst for L-Elf and Shoko to realize the roles they play. What I did not particularly like was the speed at which L-elf and Haruto went from forming a pact to reveal the truth to the world to actually doing it (literally one episode!) while spending 20 episodes on other things. I think that part of the story deserves at least a couple of episodes
