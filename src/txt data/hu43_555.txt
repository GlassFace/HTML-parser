 One Piece: Pirate Warriors
 Comes out this Friday in the UK and is already out in Japan. Not so sure about the US but I know its going their soon too. This game looks pretty good, they seem to be trying to copy the kinda style that the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm series has but it looks a bit more open in terms of combat so it should be pretty good. Tells the story from start to the end of Marineford so it has all the good bits that we all love in it. You get to play as all the straw hats and a few other characters too. Plus it has online too so it won't end up being one of those games you can only play once or twice and then let it gather dust. From what I've heard about its release in Japan was that it met fan expectations and they really liked it so I'm looking forward to getting my hands on it this Friday.
