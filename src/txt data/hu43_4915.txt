 Hard drive/disk malfunction?
 The disk check was scheduled to run after the next reboot. So I would reboot before I go to sleep and let it run. yah it seems like the chk files might be unrecoverable. I can't checked to see if any of those programs work. the first seems to be able to work. Windows diagnostics might be my last resort but I can't runt hat either. Would you recommend I run the DOS version? I've always meant to back up my files but I don't know what to say.
