 In the Mood for a Space Bandit Type Anime
 Space Adventure Cobra: Cobra is a space pirate who alienated the Pirate's guild , they want him dead, but he's a true space pirate, but is more of a hero than anything. Cobra is one of the most enigmatic, charismatic and lovable characters in anime too, he's as quick with snappy one liners as he is with his Psycho Gun, which is attached to his arm, although he probably would like a cute girl instead, like in Midori Days. Cobra is a blast! They even made a live action movie based on this series, although I wonder if it's ever going to be released.
