[Personal Life Discussions] What are your non anime hobbies? - Page 4
 So what do you do you when you aren't watching anime or reading manga? I read SciFi. I am slowly trying to learn to play the guitar. I love tech so I read up on it all the time. Mostly CNET. Oh and video games and movies of course. How about you? Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk
