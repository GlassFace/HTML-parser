 Princess Mononoke
 This is my favorite movie of all time, and it was made in '97. I remember watching this movie when it aired on toonami and I though it was the freakiest thing ever. Watching it again, I love it to death. Everything in this movie is stunning. The english dub isn't awful, though it is westernized. So, discuss this movie/ Studio Ghibli.
