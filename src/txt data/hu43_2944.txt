[Drama] Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April)
 Think I was reading that there will be 22 episodes. I'll be interested to hear the next piece. It's pretty famous, but I've never heard this particular arrangement. Considering the Kreisler piece that was featured before, I think the author has really good taste.
