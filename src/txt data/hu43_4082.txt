 Yamada-kun and the seven witches anime
 http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news...v-anime/.81574 Yep its coming this spring. I didn't realize there was a live action show for it. There was a ova that was out in December. I've read a dozen or so chapters of the manga. Its a fun read. I searched and didn't see a thread for this.
