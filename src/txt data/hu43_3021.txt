 Feminist games critic cancels talk after terror threat
 Yeah that kind of comes back to my point; claiming gamergate is doing anyone a service by making the obvious apparent isn't exactly groundbreaking or praiseworthy. No **** kotaku, porygon, whoever are useless asa metric for judging the video game medium. That has been true since video game magazine publishing really took off in the 90s through the 00s onto the internet. Video game journalism has always been a wasteland of editors and writers porking over 5/5s and As or whatever inane grading system they used to the highest bidders. Gaming journalism is simply a part of the marketing arm of the video game industry. Again, why should anyone care about that obvious fact? I certainly think boycotting Bayonetta or any other given title because of the content is dumb, but I think it's perfectly reasonable to debate the gender gap within the video game industry, within video games characters, roles, and storylines, and within the gamer community because there is a lot to be said in that regard. But websites pushing content harder or scoring it higher because of who the dev is? No ****ing ****.
