Well, you notice how the Arus president appeared visibly upset about what he was dong. Now that he knows the truth he must feel terrible about it, but at the same time the Council will never have let him in on their secret if they weren't 100% sure of full cooperation, so you know they've got Arus strung up by the toes somehow. I'm sure he's being pressured, and is fighting the turmoil and conflict within himself. So on the surface Arus will have to align with the Council, but there is a chance that they will try to rebel? Or the president might even sacrifice himself to personally fight back. All seem like likely possibilities!
