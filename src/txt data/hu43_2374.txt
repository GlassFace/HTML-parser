 Anyone else have a food addiction?
 Hot Sauces. I mean the really hot ones. I use them in cooking and I mix them into other condiments (like mustard, steak sauce, duck sauce, etc) Some of the ones I have are almost a million scoville units. Here is one of them I made hot pickles with using jalapenos and this sauce. http://extremefood.com/Ultra-Death-Sauce/ BE WARNED: This sauce contains ingredients 900 times hotter than a jalape√±o chili. Use sparingly. Not recommended for use without dilution. DISCLAIMER: This product contains the hottest known ingredients on the planet. Please use with extreme caution.
