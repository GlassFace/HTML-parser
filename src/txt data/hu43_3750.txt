 Suggestions for Drama/Romance
 So I am hoping to find something like Myself;Yourself, which as a whole was best I have seen. True Tears sounded promising and were so for first half, but never really.. how would you say.. accelerated same way and ending was very meh. I also liked sakurasou no pet na kanojo, but for what I'm looking for here it's not that much of comical/humor. Basically Myself;Yourself, what would you recommend based on that. Drama, Romance, but preferrably something wouldn't end like School Days(still recovering from that.. -.-' )
