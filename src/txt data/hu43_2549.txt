 Seryuu Signature request
 I started reading Akame ga Kiru recently and Seryuu is my favourite character so i would like to request a Seryuu signature. I looked on the internet but there aren't many Seryuu pictures and i even tried making one myself but i failed since i m not really good at art. So i request if someone is willing and able to make this in to a signature: I need here to keep saying " A sin is a sin " and for the colour you can use my avatar a a example. Thank you for you time and effort and i appreciate it.
