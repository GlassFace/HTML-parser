 Teen Sues Parents For College Tuition
 Or selfish, entitled children general thread. http://shine.yahoo.com/parenting/nj-...201404488.html A New Jersey teenager claiming that her mother and father tossed her out of their home and cut her off financially is using them for immediate support, current private-school fees and future college tuition. The parents, meanwhile, say that daughter Rachel Canning, 18, moved out voluntarily after refusing to abide by their rules. We love our child and miss her. This is terrible. Its killing me and my wife, Rachel's father, Sean Canning, a town administrator and retired police officer, tells the Daily Record. We have a child we want home. Were not Draconian and now were getting hauled into court. Shes demanding that we pay her bills but she doesnt want to live at home, and shes saying, I dont want to live under your rules. The rules, he notes, include reconsidering her relationship with a boyfriend who may be a bad influence, being respectful, and abiding by her curfew. He and his wife, Elizabeth, who live in suburban Lincoln Park, about 25 miles outside of New York City, have kept their daughters car because they paid for it, says Canning, and he admits that they did stop paying Rachel's tuition at the private Morris Catholic High School. A hearing is scheduled to take place on Tuesday in the Morris County Superior Court. Thoughts or opinions on this matter?

 The argument appears to be "my family is obligated to support me financially." Higher education is a choice and not compulsory, as the girl is legally an adult if she wanted to make that decision and cannot come to an agreement with her parents then she is completely to blame for her own situation. I'm sure there is some sort of really dumb and deep rooted horseshit going on both sides of this dispute, but the courts shouldn't be assed to take part in it. The fact that the girl's lawyer is the father of her best friend with whom she is rooming, says quite a bit. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 When you're 18, you're responsible for the contracts you form. If she goes to school and her parents don't want to help pay the bill, they don't have to. Realistically, she should probably apologize and try to reason with her parents instead of filing a lawsuit and letting it go to news outlets. It can only hurt her cause.

 Yeah pretty much what Tenken and Tova said. She seems as if she's entitled to do whatever she wishes and the parents must be the ones to obey her demands. If she's taking her parents to court because she's apparently being a brat, then it really shows how incredibly capable she is of taking care of herself. pfft.

 There is a self absorbed teenager who happens to be a total scum-**** of a person... What's new? 
 She seems to be showing some initiative so there's that. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 SO if she loses the case, would not she have even more bills to pay? Court fees are not cheap.

 She's already lost. Any lawyer who takes the case of this girl deserves the unpaid bill that's coming, knowing she's got a bunch that have already stacked up.

 The story is really being spun from the side of the parents, but what has been said here is all true. She is 18 and her parents are no longer required to financially support her. Even if they're just playing the innocent victims of a spoiled child game, they really have no legal obligation to support her from here on out. It is worth noting that they may be responsible for any of the tuition fees from when she was 17, and it may also depend on the nature of the contract with the private school. If they signed a contract with the school at the beginning of the year, they may be responsible for paying her way through the entire school year regardless of her age. It sounds like just all in all a situation that the family should really handle together. Her best friend's father is apparently bankrolling the case, which is enabling her to act like a child and force as much inconvenience on her family as possible. That's really a shitty thing to do from both his and her side. Really, in cases like these, families should just sit down together and find some common ground. "Rich white girl feels that her parents owe her money" is nowhere near the level of a case fit for family courts. 
 Yeah gotta agree on that point. If they signed her up to the private school as a minor and she moved out after the term started that bill belongs to them. Getting in a fight with your daughter is no reason to stiff the school she's already attending and the school hopefully is forwarding them the bill.

 I don't like the spin on the article or this thread. The way federal funds for college is set up, is horrible for young kids who have rich parents who aren't willing to help them out. When you fill out a FASFA for college you have to include your parent's financial information unless you're 24 years old or have a child or are/have been in the military. That being said if she's already in private school her parents are obviously wealthy enough meaning more than likely she will get denied and federal aid-grants and loans. The only other option is going with high interest private loans from banks which an 18 year old with no credit history obviously won't get approved for without a co-signer which she might not even have. If I were in her situation I would feel cornered and desperate. It's not as easy as 'work hard, it's your responsibility, get over it and do it' and it's naive for everyone who thinks it is. Now that I'm going back to college for a second degree I have to use financial aid and despite my mother living in another state, me having a full time job with the state, and claiming independent on my taxes I still have to put her tax information on the FASFA meaning I'm only eligible for 5,500 USD a fiscal year which isn't enough to attend a public college for more than one semester a year.

 If you're going for a graduate degree, you don't have to. Might be worth considering if you've got that bachelors and did well enough. I went to sort of a lesser school myself for a masters comp-sci because they let me make up the last year of undergrad work as a grad student. And in truth, no one really cares where you went to school when working. And this girl probably should've asked the lawyer who helped her sue her parents to help declare her independent/emancipated. I doubt he racked up that many legit hours helping her. Regardless, it's a legal thing here. You're responsible for your own bills when you agree to them.

I'm going for a Bachelor's degree-I have an Associates. As far as I'm aware someone who is 18 can't be emancipated. I'm not even sure if financial emancipation is possible to begin with. I don't think the argument is about her agreeing to bills-or at least from my previous post's perspective. It's the fact that she won't be able to have a bill to begin with.

 Yeah I understood that and you're probably right that emancipation at 18 isn't possible. I just have to point out that this is the way the law works, even before you consider federal student aid programs. And really your argument is more and argument against how FAFSA independence considerations are made. But if you're too loose, I guarantee people will abuse the federal aid programs. Unfortunately these two things put together means an expensive bachelor's degree from even a state university is off limits for most students who don't have financial support from their parents.

 well, they created this spoiled little bi***, so let them deal with it. I'm taking no sides here (well, of course i won't take her side lol) but i'll just say this: the girl is a stupid spoiled teenager so this kind of stupidity is nothing unexpected of her. But some parents...they just have to understand that parenthood ain't all about providing the kids with material needs and obeying their rules. You don't have to be a child molestor or something to be a bad parent. Here's a perfect example of that. And yeah, i've got one of those parents as well so i kinda now what i'm saying 
 I dunno.... I know some parents who would kill to have kids that actually wanted to go to school and have a future.

 Yeah, there normally would be the military, except they've been scaling back.

 ... The hell? How would this even get past -trying- to file the legal documents? We had our 16 year old leave cause he didn't like the rules. Tough ****. Kicked out, left, which ever it is. School, food, utilities, rent.. it all costs. Stupid adult, or mean parents, she needs to get a grip and work her ass off to provide for herself, or alternatively hook up with a sugar daddy. And in case anyone is confused, I have no doubt that she doesn't want to be at home. Wether she crossed a line, or gave em the finger and walked out, it's her life now. Kids are such entitled **** heads now adays. (Kids, then young adults, then adults)

Yeah, when you demand $650 a week in child support for yourself because you wanted to leave home, you're going to lose the court case. In court papers, she accused her parents of being abusive, contributing to an eating disorder and pushing her to get a basketball scholarship. Those ****ing monsters. 
 The face on her in the court room. She looks like a pouty, cheeky brat. Her parents probably gave her too much of everything growing up, which is why she's acting out now. Society in general is to blame for the sense of entitlement that kids have nowadays. Whatever happened to working for what you want. I had to. It's a joke that this even made it inside a courtroom. Her friend's dad is worse than she is. He should have been encouraging her to go talk to her parents and work out a middle ground. He's an even bigger ******* than the kid.

Oh yes, regardless of your parenting skill, you get the right combo of pushovers around your kid, and they start to believe that they shouldn't be accountable. If they someone important, all the more damage.
