[Anime] Anime that disappointed you - Page 2

 Fate/zero. So much hype for an anime that is just above average 
 Crest of the stars. I was looking forward to watching this then it's sequal banner of the stars but i could barely make it past the first two episodes. The voice acting is just soo bad omg there's almost no emotion in any of the characters. Banner of the stars is much better and so far has little to do with cos xept for the relationship of the main characters.

Being reluctant isnt the same as being a hero... 
 Of the anime I've been watching most recently (on adult swim), I'd have to say the ending of soul eater was really disappointing. The win they got in the end was a complete ass-pull.

 Air. I love Key stuff, and had such high hopes for it, but it was pointless and cruelly dramatic for no reason. I kind of felt a little bit that way about Clannad: After Story too. It was well-done, but just to cruel. Too sad. Would never want to see it again. I agree with everyone else on the second half of SOA. YUCK.

 Air Gear is different. Air is a key anime from Kyoto Animation and it really is disappointing. I can live with the sad ending but when there's what looks to be a fairly complex storyline running through it that misses so many details, I can't really be as forgiving. I'm thinking it's because the game writer was actually kind of weak.

I'm thinking it's because the game writer was actually kind of weak. The VN for Air was actually really good... they took too many shortcuts in the anime for it to be worth anything, for real. The same is true for the first anime for Kanon. I'm with you on this one. 
 
 Strike witches, second anime i started watching (the concept of fanservice was still unknown to me). I was expecting a good action show with a good storyline, but instead it turned out to be some porn show. I am amazed i even watched it as far as 6 episodes. 
Understanding 100% of anything is impossible. Thats why we spend all our lives trying to understand the thinking of others. Thats what makes life so interesting.

 Magikano. It wasn't that great to begin with but I can live with that. It's just that the ending made me resent the time lost that I spent watching it. 

 Originally Posted by Protoss If movies count, then my number one would definitely be One Piece Film Z. Absolutely god-awful, and yet I was very excited for it. Otherwise, I'd say Sword Art Online for the sole fact that it didn't end after the first arc (that damned 2nd arc, ugh why). I felt that way about the entire Urusei Yatsura movie franchise. (LOVED the first 2 seasons but it ran out of ideas after that.) Back in the day, (that day being the mid 90s.) everyone and their dog told me Only You and Beautiful Dreamer were epic movies. Both stunk in my eyes. They were post shark jump UY and all of the old humour was stale. (Anything after Lum started wearing school uniforms all the time is after UY jumped the shark.) The movies that followed were just plain bad with cheap animation and plots that had gotten WAY too weird. 
 Elfen Lied and Deadman Wonderland, idk for some reason I just expected so much more from these shows. The endings for both sucked in my opinion. 
 Rosario Vampire and Broken Blade in my opinion. Even though I love the latter, it still leaves more to be desired. -_-

I would say most people would agree with that. the show went from an intellectual battle of wits and supernatural power with nice battles in the first season to a cluster**** of hax bullshit with random **** making no sense happening everywhere in the second season.

 Gundam. I've seen various bits and pieces of the franchise, and, while some of it has been passable, nothing has ever lived up to my expectations for it.

 Unicorn, I probably got more out of than most other Gundam things I've seen, but I don't know, it still didn't do a lot for me. I appreciated them trying to preserve the look and feel of the '80s/early '90s Gundam shows, but there was something of the Greatest Hits album about it - it felt like I'd just seen it all before. Still curious to see 0083 and Turn-A, so I haven't given up entirely.

 I know, but still man....anime has really gone downhill since the 1990's. -_-
