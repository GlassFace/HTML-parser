[OOC] Glass Academy for Inhuman Beings
 Backstory: Welcome to Glass Academy, the school for inhuman beings. This is a school for anthropoids whom have a simple change in DNA, causing them to have abilities higher then any human capabilities. Some are small, but some are large, such as a change species. Each year, two humans, one boy and one girl, are admitted to see if a successful molecular change can be achieved, and, ultimately, to find if humans are able to communicate and live with creatures of a different DNA structure with ease. The school runs for eight hours, from 5 PM to 1 AM, to help the vampire counterparts, and other night creatures. A morning schedule is also available, for those who function best during the day. This class run from 7 AM to 3 PM. A meal is offered during each of these school schedules. Each student may choose which schedule they wish to have their education during. Halfway through the year, the students may switch to the early or late schedule if they find that the schedule they chose at the beginning of the year is not for them. Each class period consists of all of the students who chose to be in that schedule, and lasts one hour. Hybrids, vampires, werewolves, and other were animals reside in the west wing of the dormitory. Beings who have advanced mental capabilities, such as mind reading, telekinesis, mental shields, thought implanting, and other abilities that require higher mental capabilities to achieve reside in the east wing of the dormitory. Teachers and other school staff reside in the north wing, while the 8 humans lie in the south wing, in a very luxurious home.

Krys followed along with the vampire, one night Krys was attacked again by a mage, in order to keep Krys alive Caleb fed her some of his blood.

 Love that character. Cate might get some of cat boy. Hehe, definitely accepted. Just so you guys know, this is an intermediate/advanced roleplay. I'm not going to make you do two paragraphs, but one extremely detailed post should do. I don't want anyone feeling like they have to jibber-jabber in order to reach 2 para. So, as long as the information is given correctly and the spelling/punctuation/capitalization is pretty spot on, this will move very smoothly. We can all start from the beginning of a normal day, starting in the dorm rooms. If our character is in the night class, they may do as they please until the feast is served for both classes. Then the night class may have their school day. The wing your character's dorm is located in is listed below. Hybrids, vampires, werewolves, and other were animals reside in the west wing of the dormitory. Beings who have advanced mental capabilities, such as mind reading, telekinesis, mental shields, thought implanting, and other abilities that require higher mental capabilities to achieve reside in the east wing of the dormitory. Teachers and other school staff (including the student cafe server) reside in the north wing, while the 8 humans lie in the south wing, in a very luxurious home.
