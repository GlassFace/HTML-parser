 Bento Box
 Hi Hi A4, Do some people here eat bento boxes? There is an little restaurant here in the netherlands where i go to sometimes with my father or orther familie. Most of the times i choose a bento box for in the evenings. Its pretty expensive though so once a month or something i can go there. And its healthy Did u guys also knew the menu cards are a bit different then from the western countries? more picture ish. Gonna try to make one my self one day. xD
