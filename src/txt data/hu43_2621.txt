 Can Americans Make Anime?
 Wow.. I've often wondered this myself as an American who dreams of being a writer and has an addiction to anime. Thank you Star-Blazer for necro'ing this thread so I could read it.. But honestly, the OP and the answers have a communication gap. My question has always been "Can an American write an anime that would be picked up by a production company in Japan?" I always figured I could always start my own project and start an internet series that closely resembles anime. But if I did that, would a production company like madhouse see it and pick it up and say "hey, I wanna buy your stuff.". Or could I send them a script and they say "Hey, this is really good. Hop over to Japan and let's make this happen.". Or would I have to move to Japan, learn Japanese, try to become an official citizen, and start out as the mail boy in the big corporate building like you would here in America? Really, how does one become the American writer for a successful Japanese Anime?
