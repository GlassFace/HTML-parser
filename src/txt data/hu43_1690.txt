 That just looks downright awesome, it's a shame to wait until January but, good things come to those who wait I suppose, which means, even longer wait for an English dub; provided someone licenses it. I wonder if I badger Funimation with emails long enough they'll dub this and the Tatami Galaxy (along with some other anime I want) - I'm joking of course, but here's hoping.
