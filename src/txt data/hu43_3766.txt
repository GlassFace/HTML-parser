 Forum Banner.
 The forum banner..where it list anime right at the top has been the same for like a whole year..would be nice if could be changed to popular anime right now...Been away for 6months and its still the same :/ kinda weird. So just wondering if would be changing anytime soon?

 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 Moderators can do nothing about the banners. A4 has changed hands/ is in the process of changing hands, so until the new admin makes his post on the forum to say hello, I can't give anyone any timeline for that. I have talked to him, so he's human at least. Haha! :P I think, just be patient. We've had no fully active admin for almost a year now. I think we can survive a little longer.
