 Mythbusters - any fans here?
 I haven't watched the one that was just on this evening (the do try this at home show) but I have it recorded. But I have it on my dvr to record all the time so I watch it regularly. It's one of those satisfying shows where its kind of mind numbing sit back and watch stuff blow up kind of shows. But there is real science in it. And I do like how they diagnose everything and show the trial and error approach. Though it does seem like the last few years they've kind of cut back on showing the actual building process a bit. I like seeing how stuff is made. But it hasn't detracted me from it at all by any means. I can't say that I have a favorite episode. They are all good. Though I don't like the gross out ones much so I skip through those. Like when they did the salsa dip test and spit out all the time. Nor the stuff with spiders or ear wax or any of the intentional gross out junk. Other than that I do like it a lot. How about you?
