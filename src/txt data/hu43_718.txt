 Signature & Avatar Workshop v.3 (READ FIRST POST - Requests Only)
 Welcome to the Signature & Avatar Workshop. Here you may request a signature, or if you create signatures you might like to take some requests to help improve your skills ^^ Rules: - A4 signature rules apply (Signature Rules) - This thread is for signature requests only, you may not post here unless you are making a request. - Any posts that are not signature/avatar requests will be deleted. - You may not post a new request without canceling the old one. Posts will be deleted without warning. (limit: 1 avatar + signature set per request) - If you decide to take someone's request, you may post in the thread to say so. (slight change of rules) - Do NOT request a signature for use on any other forum. Such requests will be deleted. - If your request has been taken, please edit your post to say "REQUEST TAKEN (or Request Closed)" so people know which requests are open/closed. ARTISTS: Completed requests to be posted in this thread: Collection Point All users requesting signatures, you must provide an image/render or your post will be deleted. The artist should not have to search for the images. Please make sure that the images are of very good quality and at least 600px x 600px. Requests are not being taken because images are too small and of terrible quality. (READ POST BELOW) I'm not requesting, but this is the general format that requests should be.
