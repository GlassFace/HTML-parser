 ABC News does piece on video games, lulz are had
 In my gender studies course, we had to watch a video by Anita. The whole time, she gave no evidence to support her assertions and people just accepted what she said at face value. My issue was that she made such huge accusations like playing a female character in a game if you are male makes you sexist by default because you are controlling that female character's sexuality and actions. It's a video game. That female character is actually lines of code. How can an individual be oppressing women by controlling a line of code made to look female? Needless to say, I disagreed with everything Anita had to say. That and she used the phrase "trigger warning" many times and that has always irked me. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
