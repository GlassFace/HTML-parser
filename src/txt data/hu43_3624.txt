 ʕ̡̢̡ʘ̅͟͜͡ʘ̲̅ʔ̢̡̢ The Doodle Animated Story of a Young Bear Who Remembered
 ( ͡ಠ ʖ̯ ͡ಠ) ʢٛꇵٛʡ ก็็็็็็็็็็็็็ʕ͡ᴥʔ ก้้้้้้้้้้้ Prototype As you can see above, this is a huge programming challenge... and the fact that, if you make spacing become part of the word collection, then you'd be able to keep the arrow in the middle: As you can see, for those people who like doing scripts... This is excellent. Excellent for Ravock's Guardian Story. It will feel like anime. Anyway, this is what would happen to us if we were adults.

Part I The End-- Font Source: http://japaneseemoticons.net/ But as you can see... it would be impossible to think up of a story that describes my... ahem. Without conveying it like an doodle anime. And this is what would happen to anybody if they were taught to "If you lick my butt, then I'll lick yours." And I'm going to continue this again later. Because it's too ironically hilarious to put down. And I'll probably do parody versions of other stories. The End. 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
