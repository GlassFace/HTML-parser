 [Very personal] What is the worst thing that happend to you?
 Hmm it's hard to say because different experiences are different kinds of hard. I had quit some bad experiences during my life. Parents divorce, friend committing suicide, other friends becoming heavy drug addicts and ending in the street, crazy big fights with my mother, break ups.... I can't really say what was the worst, but I guess some things are less painful then others.
