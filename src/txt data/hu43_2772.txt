 dangerous addictions - Page 2
 Ever been addicted to something negative, or had disruptive behavior caused by traumas? I used to down half a vodka and another eight shots of tequila in a day, started after having quite a few shitty relationships and friends dying that ended up breaking me down and not being able to open myself about it. To try and get away from that dangerous path I started smoking marijuana. After a year with that I tried to cut it out and ended up smoking cigarettes. As of now I probably smoke a pack of cigarettes in only a few hours. This has driven me into some depressive periods, self harm as well as deprived me of my sleep and having occasional mood swings. I hope to be clean of everything one day and just lead a happy and safe life. Has anyone else ever had any dark moments, traumas, addictions, whatnot? Feel free to share if you please.
