 Mekakucity Actors
 Shintaro Kisaragi, a HikiNEET who shut himself inside his room for 2 years, had been living his life normally until he met a cyber girl named Ene, who appeared in his computer screen when someone anonymously sent him a mysterious e-mail one year ago. One day, Ene messes with ShintaroÂ’s PC which causes him to go outside for the first time in two years. 
 (I was originally waiting for Ned to start this post because I suck at this but here's nothing) The first episode screamed Bakemonogatari so very loudly I had to pause halfway through to check if I hadn't played that anime by mistake. I found out after watching it that the anime was created by Akiyuki Shinbo and Shaft, two principle players in the Monogatari series, which made things simple. Overall I liked the anime due to its similarities to Bakemonogatari and the unique storyline that it delivers that help distinguish it from the aforementioned anime. I will definitely be following this. 
 Ah, you just didn't find it in the search... It's been posted under Mekaku City Actors rather than Mekakucity Actors. http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...agerou-Project Somebody will probably just merge these.

 More interesting than I expected so far, pretty intrigued to see where they go with the mekaku group that's forming. Also kinda digging the way the various character stories are slowly intertwining, it fits well with Shinbo/SHAFTs usual work. The animation isn't as good as Shaft's stuff usually is, but it's definitely kept me on my feet and guessing as to what I'm actually seeing. 

 I liked the story for this one, and the characters are nice and memorable, but the animation just went to **** as the amount of episodes kept increasing... If you want full enjoyment out of this one, you have to make sure you watch the whole thing, otherwise it's confusing. Also, might I add that the FANART THE PEOPLE HAVE MADE IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 
 The rivals just got a lot sexier.
