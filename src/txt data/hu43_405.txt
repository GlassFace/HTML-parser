 Legal Streaming Websites
 Hopefully many of you are aware that fansubs are not a legal means of viewing or obtaining an anime series and the actual people who made the show in the first place do not profit from such fan-based efforts. If you'd like to support the actual people who make it possible for you to watch quality entertainment, then consider using one of the following websites, which are legally licensed distributors who do have permission to provide access to all the shows they offer. Keep in mind that many of the following also offer simulcasts of shows airing in the current season or are likely to upload within a week of when the episode aired. http://www.crunchyroll.com/ http://www.funimation.com/videos/simulcast http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/video/anime http://www.theanimenetwork.com/Watch-Online http://www.vizanime.com/ http://www.toonzaki.com/shows http://www.hulu.com/genres/Animation-and-Cartoons/Anime http://www.crackle.com/shows/index.a...&fg=Anime&fry= http://ch.niconico.com/ http://www.manga.com/channels/full-length-episodes http://video.adultswim.com/action/index.html http://www.media-blasters.com/ http://www.thewb.com/shows/animation http://www.youtube.com/funimation http://www.youtube.com/user/BandaiEntertainment#g/p http://www.youtube.com/user/AniplexUS#g/p http://www.youtube.com/user/4KidsTV http://www.youtube.com/user/animechannel http://www.youtube.com/user/animenetwork http://www.youtube.com/user/Crackle http://www.youtube.com/user/MANGAentertainment http://www.youtube.com/user/MediaB http://www.youtube.com/user/nozomient http://www.youtube.com/user/satelightinc http://www.youtube.com/user/WEP#g/shows http://www.netflix.com/BrowseGenres/Anime_Animation/623 http://neonalley.com/ https://www.daisuki.net/ http://www.animesols.com/ http://www.viki.com Some of the above may only be available in the US or North America unfortunately. If you know of any legal streaming sites that offer anime to other parts of the world, or simply legal sites I may have missed then feel free to shoot me a PM so I can update the list accordingly. - If you're unsure if a website you're using is legal or not, find their legal disclaimer page, or Info, FAQ or About Us page. If they confirm that none of the content is hosted on their site and that they're not responsible for anything user uploaded it's illegal. If all the content is hosted on megavideo, veoh, myspace, etc. it's illegal. Compare it to a sites Info page like on Crunchyroll, where they specifically state their content is provided by a number of asian broadcasters and even go so far as to name their partners. Their shows are hosted on their own websites streaming platform. They also state their website is in fact legal and provide plenty of information that would suggest this is true.
