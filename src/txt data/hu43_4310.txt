 1st Playthrough + No Walkthrough Do other players do this often?
 When Im playing games for the first time, I play through without looking at anything. Unless I get stuck somewhere and can figure out where to go then I might peek a faq just to see how to get past that part. Usually I don't use a guide or anything unless Im going for 100% completion. I usually don't do those unless its my 2nd or 3rd playthrough.
