Haha, it's actually not that childish or anything. I remember that there was a pretty well-written scene in there that made me cry back then. Detective Conan deals with the reality of death much more naturally, but I think Detective School Q did quite a solid job as well. If anything, it's merely kinda generic compared to other mystery anime. You should watch Monster if you're a big mystery-buff.
