 If you could turn a game into an anime...
 @Sakiya Rumei You literally jogged my memory on Fire Emblem 7. Great game! Sounds good that I didn't finish the hard 4th game. I looked up the ending again, and couldn't remember most of the supporting cast except for the main. Eliwood was a nice guy, and he definitely deserved to have Ninian by his side (especially all the battles you had to go through with him.) Hector was funny, and Lyn was an awesome heroine (had to play her first I think.) Spotted an ova of the original Fire Emblem. Wish they'd do 12 episode cours for the later games though. Would be awesome 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
