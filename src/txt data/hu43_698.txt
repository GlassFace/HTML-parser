 Recent Gaming Purchases?
 Note: Please discuss what games you've recently bought. I'll start us off ^_^. I ordered Saints Row 2 (PS3) for $23.52 New from Amazon.com today, it should arrive in my mailbox by Saturday hopefully. I just need Saints Row 4 now and then my Saints Row collection will be complete (not counting SR1 since that's Xbox 360 exclusive).

 Nice! Though, i probably would have gotten it for the pc (chillax guys, im no "PC MASTER RACE" intolerant), just for the unlimited amounts of mods. Though, PS3 all the way >:3 now that i think about it, the recent game that i got/bought was Fallout 3 GOTY version, for the ps3 :3

I usually dislike FPS games, but ever since I played/beat my friend's copy of Borderlands 1 GOTY version (PS3), I find myself sometimes wanting to try out the genre more.

You can play Fallout 3 (and New Vegas) entirely in third person. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

 I have placed a moratorium on game purchases until my birthday or when my list of unfinished Steam games is <=3. Though, for games I have purchased, never played before (excluding Anti-C, Dark Souls, FO3, F:NV, Left 4 Dead, Outlast) & will now be playing - Alan Wake - Antichamber - Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Ultimate Edition - Civilization V - Gold edition + Brave New World - Darksiders II - Dark Souls - Prepare to Die edition - Deadlight - Fallout 3 GOTY - Fallout: New Vegas - Killing Floor - Left 4 Dead - Outlast - Rogue Legacy - Trine 2 - Volgarr the Viking Note: Most of these games are on this list due to a F710 I now own/the first PC gaming controller I have owned. 
 Combination of video and non-video games: Bioshock Infinite Agricola expansion Suburbia expansion King of Tokyo

 Plus if you liked Borderlands, you'll like Fallout 3 (I haven't played New Vegas yet) as well. The concept isn't that different; its open world and with the GOTY edition, it opens up more land to explore, weapons to collect and mobs to kill as well. If you've played Skyrim or even Oblivion, Fallout 3 will feel natural to you. And although you can play Fallout in 3rd person view, it doesn't feel natural (at least to me). Only problem is, that you get side tracked very easily. Similar games would be Farcry 3 or Just Cause 2 (if you're into VAST open word exploration).

I've never played Oblivion or Skyrim before, or any other Elder Scrolls games for that matter. I'm usually only into the #1 mainstream Everyone/Teen games for Action/Adventure, RPG, and Third Person Shooter. (I just recently finally started buying Mature-rated games)

 Mass Effect Trilogy it was a bit expensive but it was well worth it the controls take times to get used to but the game is well worth going through the troubles

 The last game that I bought was "Dragonball Battle of Z" for the Playstation Vita. I had still money left on my psn account and thought it would be a good idea to purchase this game because I'm a huge Dragonball fan. 
 I actually don't play with my consoles that much tbh, so most of my games are PC and F2P. Therefore, the only thing I buy is Karma Koin/Nexon cards and RP cards - its a little sad... But I bought a $50 RP card recently o 3o! Don't know what to do with it 
 
 3ds pokemon y one piece romance dawn steam killing floor warhammer 40k dawn of war 2 ( please pm me any must play steam games) 360 battlefield 4 darksiders 1/2 dynasty warriors gundam (luv dem mobile suits) skyrim borderlands COD black ops2 (only sumtimes) lots others please please recommend anime-esk games 
 if you have a decent computer/laptop, get the trilogy on Steam. Not only is it cheaper than amazon (especially when the Steam Summer Sales start) but its a lot... defined... >:I like the graphics are slightly better than console based ports.... but thats my opinion at least C:

I like the graphics are slightly better than console based ports.... but that's my opinion at least C:. I don't have my own computer (desktop/laptop), I'm using my mom's ancient Dell Dimension 2350 desktop, with only 256 MB RAM, 64 MB Intel Onboard Driver (no graphics card), and a Intel Pentium 4 2.20 GHz CPU. That's the only computer we have in the house too sadly...which is why I have to buy the PS3 release of the Mass Effect Trilogy collection.

 Last game I bought was a used copy of Blaze Blue for $30, I heard some hype about it, but it was just a bad game. 
 Got South Park: The Stick of Truth, and it is fantastic.

 I recently ordered Ninja Gaiden Sigma 1 (PS3) for $23.47 New from Amazon.com. I can't wait to play this game, it will be my first time playing the Ninja Gaiden series. Originally Posted by Struggler Got South Park: The Stick of Truth, and it is fantastic. I've heard great things about this game. I just hope I won't have to wait too long for the price to drop down to $30 New or cheaper on Amazon.com. (I can't afford to spend more than $30 on a video game usually)

 I got Battlefield 4 for PS3 for $49 and fallout 3 for Steam for $9, but i messed up and got the normal version instead of GOTY Edition 
 Finally went ahead and bought The Last Of Us, and Batman: Arkham City. Played The Last Of Us first, and was blown away - probably will never play Batman: Arkham City because The Last Of Us just stuck with me. To play anything else, just seemed dull in comparison. It's safe to say it's the best damn game I've ever played. Highly recommended. Awesome to know that the movie is in production, too. http://www.slashfilm.com/the-last-of-us-movie/ Will get the DLC, Left Behind. Heard there were slight debates over Ellie's actions in the game. The creator summed it up well, "Doesn't matter. Sexual identity, gender, I mean who cares? A good character is a good character and that's what we were aiming for."

Being reluctant isnt the same as being a hero...
