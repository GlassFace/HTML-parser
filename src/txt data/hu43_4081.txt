 Letterboxd Account?
 Anyone else has one? Letterboxd is kinda like the "MyAnimeList" for movies, minus the forums. You add the list of movies you've watched over the years, rate them, and even review them. Here's my account if anyone wants to add me: http://letterboxd.com/johnwolff Share yours below if you have an account!
