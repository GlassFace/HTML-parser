 Emily Emily was on the ground, taking quick breaths as she recovered from the near death experience she just had. The thought of what just happened made her wobbly making it difficult to even keep herself up on her hands and knees. She was also just as confused as the duct tape that once bound her were now stuck to her clothes, still coiled in a loop binding nothing. A shadow had come over her. The man who had fired the gun, Luminary, had kneeled next to her. Emily at first looked over at the man before quickly scooting away form him with soft whimpers, covering herself defensively. She was not sure who Luminary was, but she did know that he fired a gun at her and she didn't like him. After she had moved away, Luminary made a comment about being blessed. It was true, the bullet appeared as though it had went through her from everyone's eyes, but she was there not bleeding. Whether or not she was marked by the bullet was anyone guess without inspecting her, but it was obvious she didn't appear hurt. Emily was scared. She was practically cornered, her only exit blocked by the man who shot her. Not knowing what he was going to do, or what he was going to say next made Emily that much more scared of him. He had already shot her with a gun, and the man who had held her captive was now dead. Only earlier he had seemingly killed all those other men in the warehouse. Because of this, Emily could only think the worst was going to happen.
