 In the Mood for a Space Bandit Type Anime
 The only thing I can think of from the past few years would be Space Dandy, although it seems to get a love/hate reaction from most folk. If you don't mind something a bit older though, you could try either the Dirty Pair or Space Adventure Cobra, the former being (I think) the original 'girls with guns' show and the latter proving that space adventures are better when you're smoking a cigar and have a gun for an arm.
