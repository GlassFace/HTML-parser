[General Discussion] Adopt Or Divorce & Remarry?
 If you were married & you found out that your spouse can't have children would you adopt a child or children or would you divorce & remarry somebody who can & why?Is it important to have children for you & is it important that they are from your own blood?Would you keep your marriage & resort to surrogate mothers in case you are a male or artificial insemination from another male in case you are a female so that your offspring may at least be the biological child of one of you? 
 I would be totally cool with it if my partner was sterile. I don't want any damn kids anyway. That said, it's pretty shitty of someone to reduce their partners ability to be a companion based solely on reproductive capacity. Seriously, maybe you ought to have married a brood mare instead.

 Any aspect of a companion can be a deal breaker. Be it reproductive capacity, drugs and or alchohol, ability to hold a job, financial maturity, etc. If having kids are important to someone, then it's no different than choosing a mate based on other requirements. As to finding out after the fact, I don't know. For some, there's a hangup on 'blood related' that may simply be too difficult to work around, for others, not so much. Personally, my two oldest are not mine, and I've never had an issue with it. 
 If we truly wanted children, adoption would be perfect. If you are married, then this person obviously means the world to you. And if that is true, why would you divorce them over something that cannot be fixed? I doubt anything like this would be much of a problem since I do not desire children.

 At the beginning, not having kids might not be a problem in marriage... but I am pretty sure it can become a deal breaker. It's natural to want to have a child because it makes bond between partners stronger. It's not really easy to explain it in words, but those of you who are parents you probably know what I mean : P. It's definitely something that brings your life to a whole new level.

 I would go for in-vitro fertilization and if all fails I'll probably go for adoption but surely I wouldn't consider inability to conceive as a deal breaker. I couldn't be so selfish.

 I do not want to have children, so that would be perfectly fine for me. Adoption would be the next best choice.

 Personally If I'm truly in love with someone, I highly doubt that something like infertility would be a major problem for me. I actually had a relative that divorced his wife, because his wife was unable to bear children. That being the one of the main reasons that they broke up. For me however, I care a lot about having children that is genetically mine's (in vitro fertilization), which would be my preference, but I would not take much issue with adopting either. Considering the many options that couple's have these days, people have the capabilities to overcome infertility etc.

 God, how conceited must one be to consider divorce because the person you are supposed to love can't have children. I say "conceited" because who says that they are any more deserving of passing on their genes to an unsuspecting victim than their spouse is. lol. Marriage should be based on friendship/companionship first, and the rest should happen because of this. Truth is, if the person truly loved the other, it wouldn't matter. They would adopt or come to some sort of agreement. If I have kids it'll be because of a joint decision, but if it wasn't possible, there's no chance I'd consider divorcing him. It's like when people are looking for the perfect person, perfect personality, perfect body, perfect everything. It just won't happen. No one is perfect. Same with something like this. =)

 The thought personally strikes me as kind of monstrous that people would divorce and remarry over something like that. In general, doesn't sound like a "western society" kind of though to divorce and remarry. I doubt many people here would respond that way.

 Some seem annoyed & surprised that I would ask such a question.I live in the Middle East & in the East in general (& to a certain extent in the West)it is very important to have children & especially male children to carry your name & inherit you(notice the story of Abraham in the Holy Bible).Also those children are the ones who will take care of you when you are old.Not everybody lives in a wellfare state where there are homes for the elderly & when there are it is considered something bad to abandon your parents in a home, those who took care of you from when you were a little baby untill you became a grown up,it is being ungrateful to your parents. Secondly not everybody has the luxury of marrying the one he/she loves or even meeting that person & falling inlove with him/her in the first place so they marry to raise a family ,to have sex etc. & there would be mutual respect between the 2 parties & divorcing because one side can't have children doesn't mean that the other side disrespects or despises the first side.By the way from what I understand there are far more divorces in the West ,where people seemingly only marry the one they love & after trying out many partners, than in the East.

 Usually it's not only not being able to have a kid an issue ,every marriage is different. What Daisky said is mainly true. To them its very important that wife is young and fertile. I don't really wish to get into that ugly topic. But I am pretty sure that many people who get into marriage stick because of mutual feelings for each other. There are options if you cannot have a child and if communication between partners is good, every problem is solvable.

 Adoption has just never sit right with me. If it's not mine, I don't want it. There are perks to having children, and perks to not having them. If I found a partner that was sterile, it just means that much more money in our pockets to go blow on having fun, and possessions. Not to mention more time to go see my brother's children(when he has children) and go dote on them. There's those small things like setting up college funds for your family's children, and their children, and their children after that. That's just me though. 

 I don't want kids, so it's fine by me. But if I would ever decide that I do want children, so adopting is okay. 

 Kids are a ****ing nightmare. I'm living proof of that statement. Simple as that; kids suck. 
 We were all kids, so saying kids suck or kids are annoying is contradicting, and it's just a stage that we all have went through and probably will for our kids. It just takes a lot of patience, cooperation, and understanding. And I would like to have my own kids, but when I'm financially able. 
What is a word made up of 4 letters, yet is also made up of 3. Sometimes is written with 9 letters, and then with 4. Rarely consists of 6, and never is written with 5.
 ok, but what's with love and all that other stuff that made you get married in the first place? this a stupid question imho, offends my greater intelligence

It just takes a lot of patience, cooperation, and understanding. And I would like to have my own kids, but when I'm financially able. Yeah I used to be a kid, I didn't like other kids then either. I have literally never liked kids, nor was I a typical child myself. It's perfectly reasonable for someone to dislike children, as well as the concept of children and parenthood. Kids are people yeah, but they are also a major life decision, and you will ultimately be tied to them for the duration of their lives. Friendships and relationships are, by comparison, much less demanding and far more easily dissolved. Disliking children or not wanting to be a parent is no way contradictory to having once been a child.

 I would consider having an interfile partner a massive bonus. I can't stand kids, the only reason I haven't had the snip yet is because the NHS won't consider it for someone my age and nor have I been able to find a private company who will. I'm a very selfish person (I don't consider this a bad thing) and would be a terrible parent as I would be unwilling to take any hit to my quality of life and disposable income to support a child. On the other hand I wouldn't be married seeing as when you push the romantic and religious views aside it's just a legal contract joining to peoples personal assets together. A contract that when broken seriously disadvantages the male in most outcomes, at least in my country. A long term relationship is great, I see no reason for marriage, at least not for me.

Krell; Since you hate kids (along with a couple others), would a partner pushing you for kids (even if you were snipped), be grounds for a divorce, or break up? Just curious, I've seen a couple comments saying divorcing over infertility is, to quote Shannon, 'conceited', but would those people also put up with being harassed, or possibly threatened to have kids? I'm curious of those who are against divorcing over fertility feel the same way about flip side. I somehow suspect no. 
 It would depend on if they knew before the wedding. Generally infertility is a physical issue (just like any other medical problem) that doesn't pose an issue until a couple is trying to conceive. However the desire to be child free is usually something that is addressed well before a wedding takes place. So assuming the partner knew, that going into the marriage that the other did not want children and harasses them about it, then yes, that is grounds for divorce. The key words being harass, and threaten, in your post, that's a form of abuse. The reasons you would leave in that case, are different from leaving your partner because they cant produce children.

 I'm not one big on marriage. I am big on kids though. In reference to what Elfa said, my difference is I want a kid because I want a 'little me' running around. A legacy of me, a showing of my blood, parenting, etc. The thought of sharing DNA with my woman in our offspring is a thought I smile about often though. I may not have kids, but I do love them, and would be happy to be a father. It has to be my blood, it has to be the real thing. Adoption doesn't really appeal to me. I'm not against it but I would much prefer my own natural child. If my woman cannot conceive a child than that will be unfortunate. However, my love and loyalty for whomever my woman, would likely be too deep to let go of her for such a reason. A surrogate mother might work. It can seem selfish. Ya know, because what if I couldn't produce children? But, it is how I feel.
