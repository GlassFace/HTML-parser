 [2014] The A4 Month Chat Thread - Page 2
 Here it is. Spam rules don't apply in this thread only, but you must follow all other forum rules. If you want to chat or go off topic, do it here, but please not in any other threads. This isn't a go ahead to make every other topic worse. lol. If I find that people are spamming all GNAD with offtopicness, I will move this to Events forum like last year and people might get infracted for messing up other threads. I know it gets more activity out here, so giving you guys another chance to have it back in GNAD. MAKE IT WORK! :P If you post videos USE SPOILERS! Seriously, if you don't I'll personally kill you. Knock yourselves out. Happy Birthday A4. :P
