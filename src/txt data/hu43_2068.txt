 Very funny anime. I like it so far. Just wish Chiaka was older, but thats my problem lol 
 She has the brows. That makes her old enough. The siblings were really cool too... But the coolest thing about the show was that it actually depicted Unicorns as the terrifying, fearsome creatures they really are.

 "Those eyebrows" 

 Mugi brows.

 Now we know why she carries that coffin, and why she's known as The Coffin "Princess".

 The girl is kind of annoying at first, but after seeing the second episode the anime seems to be taking a cool turn. 
 Fredrika!!! lol. "I intend to kill you, but for now Ill heal you wounds" Lol. That fight was awesome though, looking forward to the future fights :3 

 I really don't expect much out of Frederika, whoever the hell she is. Chaika is adorable, and I ship the MC and his sage-haired vixen friend nicely. The romantic aspect of the heroes going on an adventure, combating bosses, and getting more knowledge as well as the enemies also harnessing power from their own journey is really good! The creatures are fantastically represented from their the creators' boldness. I love the combat and comedy, and the pace is modest imo. Edit: The **** blocking was strong in the latest episode. I'm a fan of it though, even though I do think Chaika(s) is adorable. Great shaker upper.

 Will the real Chaika please stand up, please stand up? Chaika, don't be shocked...

 ^ i laughed harder than I should have. I'm really enjoying this series a lot and who would have thought Akari would be THAT TYPE of female.

 I wonder what White Chaika is? Forgiveness Chaika?

 Those roofs in Perimeral look ridiculous. Red Chaika has only got her body going for her. White > Red.

 White is better. She has a more noble cause for gathering the remains.

 Beat me too it Ned. 

 I... wanted to like this anime, really. What I got instead was something entirely too moe for the subject matter, for me. Ah well - at lest the animation is good!
