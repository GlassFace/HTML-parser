[Manga] What would you consider a "legendary" anime/manga?
 I was watching Hyouka one day, and a very interesting question popped up during it: Is a anime/manga legendary after a period time after it become popular and well apreciated, or is it legendary from the start? I put a lot of thought into this question, and as Chitanda would say from the show, "I can't stop thinking about it!"
