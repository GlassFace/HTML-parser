[Action] Samurai Flamenco
 Yeah the shift from "sort of slice-of-life 'superhero' doing pretty mundane crime fighting" to "traditional toku super hero" was kind of abrupt. I almost want to believe the next ep will start with that director from before yelling "cut" and all that having just been special effects or something. Since his manager said something about the director being interested in him again earlier in the ep, but I dunno. Maybe it's just changing direction pretty drastically.
