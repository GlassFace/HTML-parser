[Fantasy] Kyoukai no Kanata (Beyond the Boundary)

Mirai is isolated because of her ability to manipulate blood, which is unique even among members of the spirit world. Disturbing events begin to unfold after Akihito saves Mirai.

 Just gonna bump this since it's been picked up by Crunchyroll! KyoAni does something that isn't a terrible K-On! clone, probably worth checking out! 

 "How Unpleasant", now I have to wait another week for the next episode. -_-

 Had this on my list since a few days. Gonna see if I can find the first episode later today. Looked interesting from what I saw in the trailer. 
 
 Episode 1 is out. :3

 I got hooked 1 minute into the show.  Spoiler Once he said I love girls in glasses that was it haha 

 Well that was a huge miss. Looked as great as I expected but jesus the characters suck. Really dull and disappointing. 

 Hmm, the first episode seems rather bland, but the opening sequence made me drool with excitement. I mean, the opening is just action-packed. Successfully made me want to match more. Instantly added to watching list.

 Not exactly impressed and I didn't even feel like watching more after the first episode. Dropping this and moving on to the next anime on my to-watch list. (Yes I know I should technically go for the 3-episode-treatment but cba with this)

 :< god not only i'll have to wait for 1 week for kill la kill now this 
 Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide. *Bill The Butcher - Gangs Of New York* 
 Kyoani just bore me to tears with their shows. First ep this one shoves three of the most dull and uncommitted characters in your face and then just expects you to be interested in the mumbo-jumbo supernatural sh*t. The glasses female lead was literally just a frankenstein's monster of pop-moe ideas stitched together... Feels like all they did from Chuukoi was swap out an eyepatch for glasses. But the thing I dislike most about kyoani series are the irritating fanbase it seems to spawn everytime, as I have a feeling this will have soon.

 Just finished the second episode and liked it alot more, it gives you things to wonder about and to look forward to in the show. Curious about how things are gonna turn out so I think I'll stick ith it this season 
 This show will probably be top 3 fall for me. I enjoyed both episodes so far as they were both action packed. I like most of the characters and the story is pretty cool so far. Action and a good laugh here and there, I am set with this Anime :3 Looking forward to more episodes. 

 Looking forward to watching the second episode. The first episode gave me the feeling of nothing special but that it shouldn't be judged yet. From the pace of it, I felt that it still wasn't "set up" yet.

 Hmm, the second episode did gave more action scenes (yay), but I still not really sure where this show is heading, it feels like it's still in its preparation-phase. But since I'm al KyoAni fan, I'm still watching this series.

 I like this show better than Coppelion because it gives the audience a little more detail. One of my top shows, and funniest, of the season so far. 
 AHHHHHH DAMN!!!! WHAT AN ENDING!!! Talk about cliff hanger. The episode did a complete 180 going from pretty funny to pretty serious. Also that Giraffe animal Cracker...aka...well hopefully people got that reference.  Spoiler The preview for next weeks episode looks sick! I cannot wait 

 Watched the first two episodes.To be honest,it was rather...confusing.I don't know why but,I'll give this anime an 8/10 so far. 

 I think this show might have the worst dialogue in any anime I've ever seen. It's taking a lot of willpower not to just turn off the subtitles. I mean, I know it's a LN adaptation, but holy hell is it inexcusably poorly written. 

 I was quite unsure whether I should continue to watch after seeing episode one. I'm not feeling it, the animation pisses me off for some reason and it seems boring, so yeah...1st anime dropped 2013.

 I think its fantastic, the fighting is pretty awesome and the idea is pretty cool too. Looking forward to see what happens with the Mega Youmu 

 Just watched the 3rd episode, don't think I'll drop it just yet, it's not the best show this season but it's something to watch when I get bored The characters are nowhere near as cute as they seem to want to be though and it's kinda annoying
