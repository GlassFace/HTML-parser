[Futuristic] Karen Senki
 Karen Senki is the second CG animated series co-developed by Ohji Hiroi and Fujishima after Sakura Wars. In the post-apocalyptic aftermath of a war between machines and their creators, machines rule while humans exist in a state of servitude. Titular character Karen leads Resistance Group 11, an eclectic group of humans who find themselves fighting for their lives as they are hunted by the robots in each episode. Is this the end of humanity? Are they fighting a losing battle? Through Karen, we delve into a struggle between right and wrong, between indifference and love that explores some of the deepest questions about humanity. What is the difference between a thinking machine and a human being? What is a soul? For more information about Karen Senki please visit www.karensenki.com. PV: Episodes appear to be 11 minutes long (the first one is already aired). I wish it wasn't CG, but sometimes shows come along which are so good that the CG doesn't distract from it too much (ie, like Ars Nova, Arpeggio of Blue Steel). I'm hoping this is one of them.

 I saw the first episode..Didn't really get into it that much , but I will give two more episodes to decide if I should drop it or not. 
 Â Spoiler "If the king does not lead, how can he expect his subordinates to follow?"
 I have no idea what's going on.
