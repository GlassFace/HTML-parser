 Have you ever fasted?
 So have you ever fasted? A fast doesn't necessarily mean that you just don't eat anything for a period of time, but I'll keep it in the scope of food..since this is the nutrition section. You could fast against certain foods, etc. I'm thinking of starting a fast tomorrow. At first I was thinking of not eating at all, but that would be too harsh. I want to fast for a week. I'm thinking of maybe not eating while the sun is up. Than I was thinking of just eating rice. I may go with not eating during sun up.
