 Soul Cry
 Well it's similar to Bleach, though instead of Hollows, that are called Shells. And my small group are is in training, there job is the battle the Shells but also get to them before they turn into Shells, enter their minds and figure out why they are staying there. Once they do, they solve the so called regret of the Shell and then they can go to Heave. That is basically it. 4/21/2012 NEW STUFF IS ON AND PAST POST #12. Prologue: Life and Death  Spoiler (I know the prologue seems like a jumble mess but I'll sort it out sooner or later, untill then, enjoy the read). In the grand scheme of things, there are two constants, in this large world; there are only two things that remain the same that countless people take for granted. Some drink the pain away; some end it, right there and then, and feeling as if life had gotten too hard for them. Well, those people are stubborn and blind to the fact that Life is worth living, that there is a reason we are born, and a reason for life, that is to be the best we can be, build on the wishes of the fallen and the hope of those that follow! These are the two constants. Life and death. These are the only true things humanity knows, but with birth comes life, and with death comes the end. As with light there’s always darkness, and unfortunately, humans, being weak creatures, can’t escape this fate. That fate being death. Being unable to live past x-amount of years, there is a reason for that though. Birth: known as the beginning and the start of many new experiences. Your first breath outside of your mother’s womb, that’s your first anything. Your first cry, this is the first time that someone will ever hear your voice. Your future is untold, such as an unscarred slate. As you age there are minor things such as your first words—learning to crawl then advancing to walking, your first steps. Speeding up time and we see your first kiss, your first love and your first heartbreak. And then, life is nothing with out pain, we see your first time experiencing a loved ones death, your first accident and your first accomplishment. But as we near the end of your life, things seem to have less of an impact on you, because you have experience all that life has to offer, you may look different but you still have the firsts’, though you may not remember them, they are what has shaped you over the years, they are what makes you the person that you are now. Simply all that’s left is for you is to pass, allowing those that follow to build on what you have accomplished, to learn what you have learned, to experience what you have experienced. This is a never ending cycle, of building on the wishes of the fallen and the hopes of those that follow. With this we carve the path towards a better tomorrow. That is the cycle of life. There for, those who are dead must remain dead, for they would only get in the way of the next generation, impeding this cycle. No matter how you look at it, there is no good or evil, just a difference in opinion. Life and Death. Is there a life before birth? Or is there a life after death? To put it simply, life is one’s mind experiences’, giving said person a personality depending on those experiences. But for that to happen, others must also be around to give that one person those experiences, such as a ripple effect. Be kind to one person, and they gain a new experience, whether it shapes them for better or for worse, you have helped in a small way, and that goes a far way, because that one person will then show kindness to another, and so on. But if not—if you gain no experiences, and never are show that kindness, what would you be, just a hollow shell? As for death, death is when your experiences left your flesh, this is know as the spirit, though whether is goes to Heaven or Hell, it’s up to the experiences to decide if they believe in such places. But if not, why do they say your body is lighter after your soul has left? Is there really a soul? Could be just a myth, but what really happens to the soul… …when one’s wishes haven’t been heard, when one’s life hasn’t been filled with experiences? An empty soul; a blank slat; or something far beyond that, something that…just doesn’t fit? So, knowing this, let’s begin our tale. 1. Naomi Kalani:  Spoiler We start our story with a young female of Hawaiian ancestry. Though from the norm, she looks nothing like a Hawaiian—tall with beautiful bronze skin and an hour-glass figure, her limbs fitting her body, not too long or too short. Her full head of coal-colored hair drapes past her hips, and eyes the color of glass, with a hint of blue to them, teal almost. But if you look at them, they can send shivers down your spine, as if you’re gazing at something that is too unrealistic to be real. But she’s not mean, or aggressive, instead shy and doesn’t talk much even though she has a voice like an angel and a laugh that anyone can take joy from. But she’s an outcast from society, and her school, and that’s because she looks so different and because of the unpleasantness you would get if you got too close. She herself can’t even explain this unpleasantness; it’s like an aura that makes people not want too get close. But she becomes even more of an outcast to her peers because of the way she dresses. With clothing from another century, she wears dresses decorated with lace around the hem and sleeves, being very feminine and staying away from the tom-boy trends of her schoolmates. Our story begins with Naomi Kalani, a seventeen year old girl whom lives with her grandmother. Now, two weeks before she starts junior year at high school, she receives a phone call from her Uncle who asks her to bring their ailing grandmother back to the States, saying they will pay the expenses, as well as grant her to stay with them and go to school there, for back in Hawaii, she’ll have no relatives left to live with. Thinking this over to herself over the next week, she gladly accepts, thinking that being with family would be the wisest decision. “I’m an outcast here, anyway,” she told herself just before dialing them up again and saying she’ll come. “Naomi, I have a request I want you to do first. This is for grandmother. I want you to take her to a location that my daughter will escort you to once you have arrived,” the Uncle tells her and she accepts the request. With a week left, she packs up and after a short dispute between her grandmother, she finds no way of getting her off the island, yet finds her grandmother’s Alzheimer to be of use. Being kind about it, she tricks her grandmother, and they board a plane headed for the States. But here, on the plane, is where everything begins—A soul crying on deaf ears, longing to be heard by one such girl that has yet to know her true destiny. We find this soul entering the girl’s dreams, trying to grow, trying to be heard just enough for the girl to take note of its existence. We must ask ourselves this: How long has this soul been trying to accomplish this? Trying to be heard and trying to be noticed? How long must this soul cry? ~*~*~ The scene was out of focus at first, moving every which way, erratically, but not smoothly, as if the scene was popping up from one place to the next. With gold sparks around the images, the scene slowly began to focus, smoothly changing its colors from the shades of gray to shades of red, yellow, and blue. The image then froze in place, stopping its erratic movement and now I can see the image clearly. A bluff of limestone outcropping a small lake, that’s longer then it is wide, but I can only see that from a distances and off to the right, but what I’m guessing I’m meant to see is the couple sitting on a bench near a large rock that’s sitting vertical, that looks as if you can just poke it and it will tumble off the ledge it sits on. The couple is young and dressed in 40’s clothing, but then it looks as if time is passing, the small trees that were once around them start growing and as they grow, I see the girl remain sitting, and the man disappears for a time, only to come walking in to sit next to the girl on the bench. It looks as if at least twenty years have passed and the bench disappears and I see a wedding between them. The girl dressed with a beautifully long pink dress and the male in a handsome tux. At that moment, I felt as if something was trying to make me think, trying to show me something, but the feeling soon faded as well with the scene and time passed once again. As I watch the years past between the couple, I soon begin to feel sorry for them, watching both age so quickly. Kids enter and a realization comes over me. Two kids, a male and female. I try to say something to the female, not knowing why but my voice isn’t heard and as I watch the kids getting older with their parents, I keep on calling out to the female wanting her to hear me, a loneness building inside of me, but my voice is never heard. And just as soon as the kids appear, they vanish from the now old couple. Now with the trees looking to be fully grown, things start to slow down; longer periods are between each transition, until finally, I see the daughter of the two kids that were there before, come in, no man comes in this time. Slowly but surely the silence that was engulfing me fades out and I hear the two girls, the older one hunched over crying on her daughter’s shoulder. Then in a blink of an eye, it was all gone, I don’t know how I knew they were family, I just did, and I do not know who they were, but I felt as if I did. Then I feel a jerk and I open my eyes too the crowded but silent cabin of an airplane. Turning my head this way and that I stop, staring at the bug eyed kid in front of me. Smiling, I hold out my hand and tilt my head saying in my friendly voice, “Hi, what’s your name? I’m Naomi.” “Naomi, you’re crying.” He laughs, but I see a hand tap him on the shoulder and his mom telling him that he’s being impolite. “Sorry I was watching you,” He sighs and turns back in his seat. Bringing a hand up to my cheek I feel the tears that the boy mentioned. Was I really just crying? What a strange dream. I think to myself as I dry my cheeks with my hands. Shaking my head to clear my thoughts I look down to my grandmother sitting at my side. She let’s out one of her snores and a smile comes to my face as I think to myself that I did the right thing by bringing her back to the States where she grew up at. Uncle Mike will be happy to see his mother again after so long. What has it been, ten years at least? Ten years since he saw me as well, I wonder what he’ll think of me all grown up? Opening the window shade, I watch the sun starts to rise. Resting my chin on the back of my hand, I think of the meeting that will soon take place between all of us. After so long, I wonder how my cousins are. I think their names are Fate and Hope. I’m sure they will be glad to see me. Pausing from my thoughts, I see two female faces in my mind, both with white hair and both identical. That’s right, they’re identical twins, and they must look really pretty now, being my age as well. Wonder if I’m taller than them? I hope not. I’m already a giant compared to the women of Hawaii. Another snore erupts from my grandmother and I let out a laugh, something which is hardly heard because I’m shy. Blushing I look down at my lap, clenching the hem of my skirt and I ask myself the one question that I’ve been worried about since leaving: What is the place that Uncle Mike wants me to take grandmother to? 2. Fate and Hope Elmore  Spoiler The cry wasn’t heard—Naomi pass off what had happen to her while in the dream as a simple illusion, though crying at the sight she woke and watched as the plane descended and as the polite told them to fastens their seat belts, for they will soon arrive at the airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Meanwhile, a girl by the name of Fate Elmore waited for Naomi’s arrival. Being requested by her father, she waits patiently, watching those that flew the flight her cousin’s on to leave. But being patient isn’t her only characteristics, mainly because of her identical twin, Hope. Born by their mother Isabella, she gave them special names, Hope, because a few weeks after birth, found that she was blind. She had hoped that her sister, Fate, would be kind to her blind sibling, and help her as a kind sister. Because of her parents wishes—which she was rebellious at first, and not liking her sibling because she got more attention, she grew accustom to this and she slowly began to accept her sister, nearing her tenth year they were best friends. Fate is a small girl, about five foot, and shoulder length white hair. Large sea colored eyes, she usually has her eye-brows knit because she is normally serious and laughs only when she herself finds something funny, which is rare. Though she may look feminine by her light skin tone and thin structure, as well as her wardrobe of dresses and skirts—she always has jeans under them. They wear the same clothing, sometimes confusing people unfamiliar with them, as well as doing it on purpose, to get out of stuff one disliked. But there is one thing that’s different from Hope and her, Hope wears the clothing with out jeans pants, liking looser fitting clothing so she doesn’t have to bother with tripping while getting dress from being blind. Six years have passed since then and in a way, that have both grown the same amount and look exactly the same, so switching who they are is done with ease. Sitting back, Fate sighs to herself as she watches an old couple pass. Half asleep from staying up most of the night at practice, she shakes her head, trying to rid herself of her tiredness. With large headphones on, and some rock tunes playing, she spots an old woman and a tall girl walking through security. Recognizing them, or at least the old woman as her grandmother, she smiles and stands, picking up the sign that she had written her cousin’s last name on, she hoped this would attract them from the crowed. The tall girl looks her way and they meet each other gazes. Something about her doesn’t seem right, Fate thought to herself, watching as the girl came closer and closer to her, escorting their grandmother. Fate fakes a smile, and hugs Naomi, congratulating her on her safe trip from Hawaii. Though Naomi stumbles on her name, accusing her of being Hope at first, Fate corrects her. Hugging her grandmother as wells, they walk through the airport and into the streets, where a cab awaited them, arraigned by Fate’s father to drive them to Devil’s Lake—a very special place to their grandmother. When they arrive after the two hour drive, will their dear grandmother recognize the place? ~*~*~ As the scenery rushed past us, my cousin was stunned with the beauty of all the trees. How they made a sort of arch over the many back rode that the cab was taking up to get to the place called Devil’s Lake. Grandmother was in front, talking with the cab driver, but it seems as if the driver doesn’t like her company much. She’s complaining about his driving. Leaning forward over the seat, I glance at the man, who is now looking teed off. Then looking at my grandmother I ask her to stop complaining and tell her how the driver is doing fine. She ignores me, asking me what I know about driving since I don’t even have my licenses yet. Trying to be sweet and sincere I tell her that my dad has been teaching me and that I go for my license in a few weeks. But she just grunts at my comment and keeps on complaining. “In my day…” she began before I noticed that Naomi has stopped looking at the scenery of the fall colors. Then she asks, “Grandmother, do you recognize where we’re going?” Although saying nothing, something makes me stop to look at her, as if something has changed, and it has. For no longer then the blink of an eye I notice that she has changed, she looks younger, a lot younger, her once gray hair a beautiful blond, like the color of the leaves that are falling to the ground. Her wrinkles gone and she’s wearing an old pink hat that looks as if it’s from the 50’s. But that’s all it is, the blink of an eye and she’s back to her old self. Turning to look out the window her self she gazes at the leaves, a certain sadness falling over her, and although she has Alzheimer it looks as if she’s recognizing this place, recognizing without recognizing it. “Fate?” I hear my cousin say to me but when I say nothing she calls my name again. “Fate?” Shaking my head trying to figure out if what I just saw was real or not I look at her, “what do you want?” I try to say nicely but it comes out as if I’m mad. Clearing her throat she asks “Where we’re going, what are we taking grandmother there for?” Sighing, I watch her face, looking for anything that maybe wrong, that may tell me something about this feeling, and is it connected with what I just saw from grandmother? When I see none and when she coughs, as if the awkwardness has gotten to her I reply, “My dad wouldn’t bother with telling me the details—only that this place has a deep meaning to grandmother. He wanted his mom to see this place one last time, as if knowing grandmother was to die soon.” Naomi just nods to my response, but at that point I realize something myself. Looking back towards my grandmother I then bring my attention to the fall leaves outside. The remaining half hour of the car rid or so, grandmother falls asleep and Naomi continues watching out of the window as the trees rushed past us, and soon large limestone outcroppings began to appear along the roads. Seeing the outcroppings of stone only meant that we’re within a few miles of Devil’s Lake State Park. Leaving the cab, I motion to Naomi and grandmother that we we’ll be taking a short hike and though grandmother complained and it seemed as if she had no senses of why I was leading her to the place my Dad told me about. The start of the hike started once we reached the rocks, the limestone that will be are path up the bluff, though steep, Dad instead I take this path and not the path from the back for this will give his mom a better chance at finding the deep meaning herself. As we began to climb, past the trees that entangled the rocks with their roots, we soon found ourselves on uneven surfaces, and grandmother soon fell behind, at which point Naomi and I needed to help her out. And as we came closer to where dad had told me to take her, she began rushing, mumbling to herself, all of which I hear only hear a few words because of how softly she was speaking, as if she couldn’t believe what was happening. But the one thing she kept repeating that I could hear loud and clear, was twenty years. I don’t know if Naomi hear it but that seemed to be one thing that she kept saying. As I tried to search in my mind what I knew about twenty years ago that had to do with my grandmother, I forget the time that is passing us by as we climb the trail. Soon I find that it seems grandmother is leading us, and she parts from us, only to take off in a sprint, and once again I see the young grandmother I saw while in the cab. This time the image lasts longer and I see a man come into the scene in similar clothing as my grandmothers, the same time period. Embracing each other with their arms, the image of my once young grandmother vanishes again and I see her hunched over on the ground crying near a bench. But beyond the bench, is a large stone standing length wise, and looked like it could fall off the bluff at any second. Looking to my right at Naomi, I find she is crying to. “That must have been grandfather.” I repeat to myself. “This is where grandmother meant grandfather. This place…” She pauses, more tears streaming down her cheeks as she watches grandmother kneeling before the large stone, then she starts whaling, almost as if in agony. “My Morgan, my sweet, sweet Morgan!” she whimpers in her old and tired voice. “Morgan, I’ve come—” but she stops in mid-sentences, her hand reaching for something in the air but all I see a bright flash, and then silences as the light engulfs me I black out for a time, but when I reawaken, I’m lying against a tree, and in front of me, I see my dad with some paramedics and an ambulance. With the night sky upon us, all I see are the beams from the vehicles, and then a figure in front of one of them turns and walks towards me. As the figure gets closer I can tell it’s a girl, and soon enough I hear her voice, and see my sister’s head of white hair. Stumbling a bit I laugh and she hears me laugh and laughs to, but as quickly as that began, she goes quite again. “Grandmother had a heart attack, she died.” Hope, repeats this to me. I have more done to this, two other chapters but those I rushed through so I'll post them later.

 Despite you saying it was a jumble, I rather liked the opening. It had a good feel to it. It could use some cleaning but all the same don't change it too much. As for the introduction of your character I found that more awkward, but i always think intros are awkward to write. The style you used made it feel like some sort of movie introduction or something, maybe it was what you were going for but i didn't like it on the whole. I wouldn't be able to suggest a better way to introduce her though. I didn't like the contradiction between you saying she was shy and her casually introducing herself on the plane though. For someone you set up as shunned by society her personality didn't reflect it. When you latter on mention she hardly laughs because she's shy it just adds to the contradiction. I dislike the general introduce a character by describing everything about them approach. I rather a situation where the reader discovers reading that this person is like such and such, or that the twins like to act like each other and what not. It feels more natural imo. Like when you meet a real person. Apologies but i'll finish the second half latter and get back to you. Favourite TV show is about to begin Anyways, nice work. Might read some of your other stuff.

Well she is shy, but to children she fits right in, she doesn't find them as threatening, which I will explain more on that later. As for describing them, I never found myself good at that so that is why I took this approach, once I'm done with that will see later in the story how they grow.

 as promised read the second half. I would have picked either third or first person and stuck with one rather than jumping between the two of them. That's personal preference there, it just breaks the story jumping between them. Other than that just a few captials and things around the place that should be in, i wouldn't be surprised if you just missed them writting it, misuse of meant instead of meet took a while to work out. (third last paragraph) I'd like to see where you plan on taking the plot.

"Time to bring the place alive!"
 There is actually a chapter before this little segment but it works in this order just as well. I'll post the other chapter soon enough. The Light:  Spoiler In the emptiness of a white universe a single white figure with a black outline sat cross-legged, deep in thought—her soul struggling to remain whole. Trying to fight what will consumer her. Yet her spirit is now so out of touched that she’ll never be herself again. Yet she tries in vain to keep together. She’ll have no sense once she changes, no matter how much she struggles. We should feel sorry for her, for she may not be able to make tell her message. ~*~*~*~ This message, will she understand it? She must understand my message! She must know that her life is threatened. If I can just make her understand my message she’ll be better off, she’ll be able to protect herself. I only hope she can understand it before I drift into the emptiness that seems so close now that if I even lose focus for a second, it will grasp me. She must understand, before I disappear from this single thread of life that I’m still clinging to. I want to cry to her, I want her to understand… ~*~*~*~ I was crying before it happened, but when the flash came, I instantly stopped. The sound of the blinding light was like that of a coming storm. All I could do was staring in awe as the light surrounded me, I spun around to watch my surrounds of the park vanish, and soon, the noise stopped. Silences filled the air and an eerie feeling rushed over me as I looked for some signs of color in this bleakness. Looking around me, I saw nothing but the light. I didn’t know if I was consumed by it or not, all I knew is my previous surrounds were gone. Everything and everywhere was a solid color of white—so blinding it hurt. A small chuckle sounds from behind me. A familiar one too—who it belongs to I do not know though. Turning on the spot my first reaction is to run, but I can’t, I’m too shocked by what I turn to see. In front of me sits alone figure—a silhouette in this bleakness. A white silhouette outlined by a blotchy black outline, barely revealing its human shape. I try to form words, too stunned to form worlds, yet I manage to say “who?” Smiling, the laugh comes again. The thought that I’ve heard that laugh somewhere pops in my head again. One leg down as if sitting cross-legged the other up, its elbow resting on its knee. It points to me with its smile. Each tooth showing itself in detail, almost as if I were looking through a telescope at them. An eerie toothy grin was smiling back at me, and I felt like running, I wish I could but my feet don’t seem to want me to move. “Hear me.” The silhouette’s voice echoes around the bleakness. Flinching at her voice—an obvious female’s voice—I take a step back. The silhouette sees my reaction and steps forward, as if frightened or pleading with me. Showing body movements that one would show if they were trying to make you understand something and you won’t by it. “Please, Rose.” The silhouette calls to me, “I must help you.” Finding this thing less hostile, and less frightening than when I first saw her, I smile, deciding to be kind myself. “My name is Naomi, not Rose.” The pleading silhouettes shoulders sunk as I spoke my words. Then the silhouette stands up straight again, as if realizing some. And so suddenly had the silhouette down so, that an invisible force knocked me to my knees. My ears soon filled with static, I heard nothing but static. My hands reaching for my ears, as the sound of the static becomes too great, my eyes close and I feel an incredible pain in the back of my head. Like a sledge hammer to the back of the head. My head pounds and I want to scream. I think I did scream even. But soon I feel a warming sensation, and upon looking up, I stare into the face of the silhouette, still with just the outline of a smile, she says “The rose.” With one hand on my shoulder, and the silhouette kneeling in front of me, she hands me a rose. I feel a cold sweat covering my body, my breath is ragged from the pain that I’ve just felt, yet here and now there is no pain, and the static is gone. “The rose,” the silhouette repeats again, as if beckoning to me to take the blue rose that’s in front of me. My mind still spinning I just stare at that rose for the longest time. Hearing a few splashes of water hit the endless white that I feel as if I’m floating on, yet still solid. The silhouette leans towards me, bringing the rose closer to my face. The pain and static soon returns. My mind blanks out for a bit as all the focus is on the pain, I cover my ears and I just pant. Even more sweat rising to my skin then falling to the ground. “I can’t understand this, what is going on?” I say, pain in my voice as I speak each word. I let out a small scream as the pain intensifies. “Just, end this, what ever you are!” “Listen to the rose, hear it, and take it.” The silhouette calmly tells me, and through the static, I somehow heard her. Reaching out a shaking hand, I take the rose as she commanded me to, yet upon taking it, I prick myself on the stem and drop the rose to the ground. The rose disappears before it lands. With blood surfacing from the skin on my left hand, pointer finger I gaze back at the silhouette. She’s just smiles back at me, with a small laugh and then the silhouette blows away with an invisible wind. “Remember the rose.” I hear as the remaining dust of her body blows away. ~*~*~*~ Upon pricking her finger, the figure vanished, using what she could to give the message. But, since she used to much of her soul, she is now nearly there to becoming what she was struggling to avoid. While the blood leagued on Naomi’s finger a little longer, it soon fell to the ground. Distorting the bleakness, and soon making the woods of Devil’s Lake reappear.

 So how many unfinished works do you have now? You should list them in your signature. 
Currently listening to: SULK - End Time I wanna fade out.

I move from story to story, as of now I have about three main one's I'm working on and 17 other ideas. A few of which I have already started on. And I have semi-full stories in my head for about six of them, give or take. Anyway I'll do that suggestion and put them in my sig so people can take a look at them.

 I've editied my prologue to this story. Please enjoy.  Spoiler In the grand scheme of things, there are two constants, in this large world; there are only two things that remain the same that countless people take for granted. Some drink the pain away; some end it, right there and then. Feeling as if life had gotten too hard for them—death soon follows. Well, those people are stubborn and blind to the fact that life is worth living, that there is a reason we are born, and a reason for life, that is to be the best we can be. Build on the wishes of the fallen and the hope of those that follow. These are the two constants. Simply put… …life and death. These are the only true things humanity knows. But with birth comes life, and with death comes our end. As with light there’s always darkness, and unfortunately, humans, being weak creatures, can’t escape this fate. This is our fate—the fate of dying one day. Being unable to live past X amount of years, there is a reason for that though. Birth: known as the beginning and the start of many new experiences. Your first breath outside of your mother’s womb, that’s your first anything. Your first cry, this is the first time that someone will ever hear your voice. Your future is untold, such as an unscarred slate. As you age there are minor things such as your first words. Learning to crawl then advancing to walking—your first steps soon follow. Speeding up time and we see your first kiss, your first love and your first heartbreak. And then, life is nothing without pain. We see your first time experiencing a loved ones death. Your first accident and your first accomplishment—weather minor and large. But as we near the end of your life, things seem to have less of an impact on you. You’ve experience all that life has to offer and you may look different but you still have the firsts’, though you may not remember them, they are what have shaped you over the years, they are what makes you the person that you are now. Simply all that’s left is for you is to pass, allowing those that follow to build on what you have accomplished, to learn what you have learned, to experience what you have experienced. To learn upon the mistakes of the past for they maybe condemned too repeating them themselves. This is a never ending cycle, of building on the wishes of the fallen and the hopes of those that follow. With this we carve the path towards a better tomorrow. That is the cycle of life. Therefore, those who are dead must remain dead, for they would only get in the way of the next generation, impeding this cycle. Making the new think as if they were old and not growing themselves with the passing of their own lives. This then cripples the cycle. No matter how you look at it, there is no good or evil, just a difference in opinion, as with life and death. Now what is the question? Is there a life before birth? Is there a life after death? None of the above, for the real question is whether you believe in such things. A life after death or a life before birth—an eternal life. But all it narrows down to is life in itself. Life is one’s mind experiences’, giving said person a personality depending on those experiences. But for that to happen, others must also be around to give that one person those experiences, such as a ripple effect. Be kind to one person, and they gain a new experience, whether it shapes them for better or for worse, that person has helped another person in some small way, and that goes a far way, because that one person will then show kindness to another, and so on. But if not—if you gain no experiences, and never are shown that kindness, what would this be? A hollow shell? Looking at death’s view—death is when your experiences leave your flesh. This is known as the spirit, though whether is goes to Heaven or Hell, it’s up to the experiences that person had to decide—to decide if they believe in such places or not. But if not, why do they say your body is lighter after your soul has left? Is there really a soul? Could be just a myth. But what really happens to the soul… …when one’s wishes haven’t been heard, when one’s life hasn’t been filled with experiences? An empty soul? A blank slat? Or something far beyond that? Something that just doesn’t fit? This is a story of one of these creatures, although human at one time, now dead. In a sense this is the beginning of this story. For you to understand now, you’ll just have to read all that follows. Sorrow, guilt, love, pain, joy, anger, and revenge will all surface in the pages that follow. Please enjoy.

 Mo'Steel is back to writing again, and this time, my book Soul Cry! This is the prologue, or more like an Author's note...a mix? Anyway.  Spoiler Where to begin? Heaven and Hell; do they even exist? Humans do not know this, for we are living, or what we call living, what humans came together to call something that is alive, something that is moving in flesh and that has a mind, a will to live. As long as humans have the will to live, we are alive. But what about death; when human bodies are cremated or thrown into the ground to rot, are humans no longer alive? Is death really the end for them? This goes without say, all animals, for that is all a human is, an animal, the animal that dominates over other animals. Those on top choose what happens to those on the bottom. That is how it has always been and always will be. All things live, all things die. Going back to death But what about before life begins, were we not already dead then given life in our mothers womb by our fathers seed? Is that when the soul comes to the flesh given to us by our parents? Then this leads us to where the soul comes from. A magical thing, a magical word that humans have giving something that spawns from nothing, such as time, time is a word humans have labeled the orbiting Earth around the Sun, giving us years, months, weeks, and days. Time. Time is how we even label ourselves, by how many days, weeks and so on that we have been on this small planet of ours. The soul; a collection of experiences which dictates us as we grow and age Every new experience we come into contact with changes us ever so slightly. For good or bad, what happens is our choice thats already predetermined by our previous experiences. Then can this not be considered the soul because its what makes us who we are, what we do, every action and reaction. Our soul is essentially our personality. This is why with age, humans grow wise. Humans who have already spent, and used up there time on this planet can now give their knowledge to those of the next generation. This is the only way humans know to progress, and probably will be the only way they ever do for all eternity. This is death. To leave the flesh that was once giving to them as for the soul, where that ends up is entirely up to the experiences that the soul has had. Heaven or Hell, their choiceeternal life. The soul is nothing but a blank slab waiting for a chisel. Which leads us to what happens when there is none, or when the soul doesnt know. When no experiences are introduced to the soul, when no personality is formed what does this become? An empty shell? Nothing? Something? This is where our story begins; with one of these poor creatures, a human at one time though, now dead and slowly being consumed for the soul doesnt know. Now for you to understand what will be transpiring in the following pages you must read, included are these feelings; sorrow, guilt, romance, pain, joy, and anger. Many feelings will surface and its up to your soul, your personality to understand the experiences that are about to take place as your read. So knowing this, please enjoy. 555 Words (I should try for 666 XD) The Update of my Original prologue.  Spoiler In the grand scheme of things, there are two constants in this large world. There are only two things that remain the same that countless people take for granted. Some drink the pain away; some use stimulants to take their mind to a far away world, and then others just end it right there and then as if life had gotten too hard for them. Well, those people are stubborn and blind to the fact that Life is worth living, that there is a reason we are born, and a reason for us to live and that is to be the best we can. These are the two constants. Life and death. These are the only true things humanity knows, with birth comes life, and with death comes the nothing. As with light theres always darkness, and unfortunately, humans, being weak creatures, cant escape this fate. Our fate being death, being unable to live past x-amount of years, but there is a reason for that. Who really would want to live forever? Birth, this is known as the beginning and the startor beginning of our journey. You cry and your voice is heard for the first time, youre seen for the first time and your future is unclear. As you grow your experiences shape you. You see sorrow; you experiences joy and friendship; you argue; you give and take advice; you love. All these things make you who you are but at some point, they get old. And by this time you your self are old as well. Nothing anymore has an impact on you because you have experienced all that life had to offer. You may look different and your body may ache but you still have you experiences. You may not remember them, but they are what shaped you, they are what makes you the person you are now. Whats left? Death? Death is all that is left now. Allow those that follow to build on your accomplishments and only to live by the wishes that you once had. They will learn everything you once knew. But they will improve on that knowledge. This is a never ending cycle, the cycle of life. There for, those who are dead must remain dead, for they would only get in the way of the next generation, impeding this cycle. No one should live foreveror should want to live forever. But lets back track and add to this thought, how do we gain these experiences? Two. As long as there are others around, well always grow for we gain knowledge for them and they gain knowledge from ussuch as a ripple effect. But if there is no two, youll gain nothing. Youre just a lonely soul longing for something more. What shall we call this? A hollow shell perhaps? Something that doesnt know life or death? Something that hasnt gone through the experiences that others have because there were no two? Or something that just doesnt fit? So, knowing this, lets begin. 503 Words I'd like for the two to be compared to each other and a few opinion on which one is liked more and I will pick from the replies...if I ever get any. And if not, I'll probably just stick with my new prologue, the first one in this post. Going to thank these two video's which I listened to while typing out the new prologue. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyfIJ...H_ 2UjNROMiIqA LOL, there is a one video per post limit.

 Mainly I just edited the old version because it was still good and probably better then I can do now...I need to get back in the habit of writing more so my writing is consistence. Chapter 1: Naomi  Spoiler We start our story with a young female of Hawaiian ancestry. Though from the norm, she looks nothing like a Hawaiian—tall with beautiful bronze skin and an hour-glass figure, and her limbs fitting her body, not too long or too short. Her full head of coal-colored hair drapes past her hips, and her eyes, the color of glass, with a hint of blue to them, almost teal. But if you look at them, they can send shivers down your spine, as if you’re gazing at something that is too unrealistic to be real. But she’s not mean, or aggressive, instead shy and does not talk much even though she has the voice of an angel and a laugh that anyone can take joy from. Then again, she’s an outcast from society, and her school, and that’s because she looks so different and because of the unpleasantness you would get if you got too close. She herself cannot even explain this unpleasantness; it is an aura that makes willing people not wanting to get close. Could it be her cold eyes or her unrealistic looks? Little bit of both, but mainly the aura. Then again, her fashion sense too… She becomes even more of an outcast to her peers because of the way she dresses. With clothing from another century, she wears dresses decorated with lace around the hem and sleeves, being very feminine and staying away from the tom-boy trends of her schoolmates. Our story begins with Naomi Kalani, a seventeen year old girl whom lives with her grandmother. Now, two weeks before she starts junior year at high school, she receives a phone call from her Uncle who has asked her to bring his ailing mother—her grandmother—back to the States, and saying that he will pay the expenses, as well as grant her to stay with them and go to school there, for back in Hawaii, she will have no relatives left to live with. Thinking this over to herself over the next week, she gladly accepts, thinking that being with the family would be the wisest decision. “I’m an outcast here, anyway,” she told herself just before dialing them up again and saying she would come. “Naomi, I have a request I want you to do first. This is for grandmother. I want you to take her to a location that my daughter will escort you to once you have arrived,” the Uncle tells her and she accepts the request. With a week left, she packs up and after a short dispute between her grandmother, she finds no way of getting her off the island, yet finds her grandmother’s Alzheimer to be of use. Being kind about it, she tricks her grandmother, and they board a plane the designated plane that is headed for the States. But here, on the plane, is where everything begins—a soul crying on deaf ears, longing to be heard by one such girl that has yet to know her true identity. We find this soul entering the girl’s dreams, trying to grow, trying to be heard just enough for the girl to take note of its existence. We must ask ourselves this: How long has this soul been trying to accomplish this? Trying to be heard and trying to be noticed? How long must this soul cry? Will it ever be heard? ~*~*~*~ The scene began out of focus at first, moving every which way, erratically, but not smoothly, as if the scene was popping up from one place to the next. With gold sparks around the images, the scene slowly began to focus, smoothly changing its colors from the shades of gray to shades of red, yellow, and blue. The image then froze in place, stopping its erratic movement and now I can see the image clearly, like a movie. A bluff of limestone outcropping a small lake, that’s longer then it is wide, but I can only see that from a distances and off to the right, but what I’m guessing I’m meant to see is the couple sitting on a bench near a large rock that’s sitting vertical, and that looks as if you can just poke it and the boulder will tumble off the ledge it sits upon. The couple is young and dressed in 40’s clothing, but then it looks as if time is passing, the small trees that were once around them start growing and as they grow, I see the girl remain sitting, and the man disappears for a time, only to come walking in to sit next to the girl on the bench. It looks as if at least twenty years have passed and the bench disappears and I see a wedding between them. The girl dressed with a beautifully long pink dress and the male in a handsome tux. At that moment, I felt as if something was trying to make me think, trying to show me something, but the feeling soon faded as well with the scene and time passed once again. As I watch the years past between the couple, I soon begin to feel sorry for them, watching both age so quickly. Kids enter and a realization comes over me. Two kids, a male and female. I try to say something to the female, not knowing why but my voice isn’t heard and as I watch the kids getting older with their parents, I keep on calling out to the female wanting her to hear me, a loneness building inside of me, but my voice is never heard. And just as soon as the kids appear, they vanish from the now old couple. Now with the trees looking to be fully grown, things start to slow down; longer periods are between each transition, until finally, I see the daughter of the two kids that were there before, come in, no man comes in this time. Slowly but surely the silence that was engulfing me fades out and I hear the two girls, the older one hunched over crying on her daughter’s shoulder. Then in a blink of an eye, everything vanishes, all is gone, I don’t know how I knew they were my family although that maybe the reason I tried calling out to the girl, she was my mother. A jerk shakes me from my slumber and I open my eyes to the crowded but silent cabin of an airplane. Turning my head this way and that I stop, staring at the bug eyed kid in front of me. Smiling, I hold out my hand and tilt my head saying in my friendly voice, “Hi, what’s your name? I’m Naomi.” “Naomi, you’re crying.” He laughs, but I see a hand tap him on the shoulder and his mom tells him that he’s being impolite. “Sorry I was watching you,” He sighs and turns back in his seat, obeying his mother. Bringing a hand up to my cheek I feel the tears that the boy mentioned. Was I really just crying? What a strange dream. I think to myself as I dry my cheeks with my hands. Shaking my head to clear my thoughts I look down to my grandmother sitting at my side. She lets out one of her snores and a smile comes to my face as I think to myself that I did the right thing by bringing her back to the States where she grew up at. Uncle Mike will be happy to see his mother again after so long. What has it been, ten years at least? Ten years since he saw me as well, I wonder what he’ll think of me all grown up. Opening the window shade, I watch the sun starting to rise. Resting my chin on the back of my hand I remain watching the sun, thinking of the meeting that will soon take place between all of us. After so long, I wonder how my cousins are. I think their names are Fate and Hope if I remember that correctly. I’m sure they will be glad to see me. Pausing from my thoughts, I see two female faces in my mind, both with white hair and both identical. That’s right, they’re identical twins, and they must look really pretty now, being my age as well. Wonder if I’m taller than them? I hope not. I’m already a giant compared to the women and my classmates on Hawaii. Another snore erupts from my grandmother and I let out a laugh, something which is hardly heard because I’m shy and my voice is very soft. Blushing I look away from the window and down at my lap, clenching the hem of my skirt I ask myself the one question that I’ve been worried about since leaving… 1,467 Words

I think Vessicator was being sarcastic, meaning you have too many unfinished works. Also were you officially given the title "a4's story developer"? I highly doubt that.

I highly doubt that. No, but no one else had the title or that I saw so I give myself the title. I'm quite good at developing stories, just not getting them down on paper. And a lot for the first question.

I don't mean to be rude, but don't you think that could come off as offensive to some that you name yourself the best story developer on A4, when there are others aspiring to write too, including myself.

That's just a matter of opinion, I never had anyone comment on it before so it never has been a problem and still isn't. I won't be changing it either, it's been that way since I made this account.

 I like it, very developed and a good attention getter (prologue). Although, the dialogue might be better if in a new paragraph, however this is my opinion. Keep up the good work! 
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day14 14But take me to the place I love, take me all the way.
