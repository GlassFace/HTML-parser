 Heart Wrenching Romance/Drama/Tragedy Anime?
 Hey There! ^^ I've just finished watching "Angel Beats" and am now looking for my next emotional roller coaster. If anybody has any shows that can literally make me burst into tears like "Clannad", "Kanon", "Angel Beats" and so many more let me know! (Yes I've seen Clannad: After Story) Sincerely, Monzta

 Ano hi mita hana no namae o bokutachi wa mada shiranai Air Rumbling hearts Those are the only heart wrenching ones that come to mind.

 Ano hi mita hana no namae o bokutachi wa mada shiranai This, definitely. Also consider 'True Tears' 
 
 If you don't mind Magical Girl anime, Princess Tutu is an original, rollercoaster-like series that's known to have broken many hearts. Whether or not it's a tragedy is something you'll have to judge for yourself when the time comes, though. If it doesn't necessarily have to end in misery (and you still don't mind Magical Girls), then... Pretear is a thirteen episode long anime that gathers a lot of complicated, unhappy memento as it chugs along. It also cuts out a lot of the repetitive scenes that most Magical Girl anime includes, so it focuses heavily on plot. And if you can abide with it long enough, Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne turns into a massive struggle in the second season. Outside of Magical Girls, the only thing I can think of right now would be Chrono Crusade / Chrno Crusade. It gets to the "dark" bits very quickly... (Sorry that I don't know anything that bases its plot solely on drama. ^_^')

 I strongly suggest you watch School Days. It'll send you on one hell of a roller coaster if that's what you're looking for.

 Ano Hana Peach Girl Rumbling Hearts Give those a shot. Lots of other good ones have been said in this thread, or I'd have named more. :P

I've seen "School Days" I even started a thread on here entitled "[School Days] Were you prepared?" lol I HATED this anime just because it took it to the extremes... Well I wouldn't say "hated" so much as I was "Indifferent" just because that was just... too over the edge for me. lol

 School Days didn't make my heart wrench, it just made me angry increasingly from ep4 onward as opposed to other anime that did make me sad.

 Uhm, well School Days, yes. It's very emotional, but not the emotions you'd expect from a romance. I enjoyed Shuffle!, but it takes sooo long to get into it. I think it's a bit of an acquired taste? 
 Ano Hana is definitely a heart wrenching anime. It's name translates to something like the flower we saw that day and is really long. https://www.google.com/search?q=ano+...hrome&ie=UTF-8

 Alrighty guys and gals, I've seen every anime you guys have suggested now so if anybody can think of anymore I'd greatly appreciate it! ^^ Thanks!

 These aren't heart wrenching but I still enjoyed/enjoying them. Space brothers Natsuyuki Rendezvous The ambition of oda nobuna Future diary ( this one is a little heart wrenching)

 It's kind of an anime. I guess. There's this game called Catherine. Watch a playthrough of that. It's pretty crazy. 
 I would recommend you watch the first OVA of Samurai X called Trust and Betrayal or Tsuiokuhen. It tells the story of Kenshin's past and how he got his scars. It's not the school stuff most everybody here recommended but it's one hell of a tragedy. 
 REAL MEN WATCH CLANNAD 
 Not sure if your into psychological but X is a good anime with tragedy. http://toonzaki.com/x 
 hmm I recently watched Rumbling Hearts and I wasn't moved to tears, I didn't find it that emotional personally, but I do agree with you when it comes to Clannad and Clannad After Story, they are both tear jerkers. You could try Shuffle, Kanon 2006, Fruits Basket (even though I wasn't moved to tears, you might be. it's cute) and Ai Yori Aoshi, which I just started watching and so far I"m enjoying it. I don't know if I"m being helpful or not, but that's all I can think of, unless you'd like a longer anime that may or may not annoy you haha if so I recommend NANA, I loved it.
