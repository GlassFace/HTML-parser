 Japanese Candy Subscription?? Advice/experiences?
 Hi there! I miss Japanese food and candy so much, but it's just not readily available for me to buy where I live. I was wondering... do any of you have experience with subscription-based crates? I've heard of Skoshbox and Japan Crate, but I'm a little reluctant to subscribe. Have any of you tried these crates where they send you a selection of Japanese candy each month? Are they worth the money?? I appreciate your feedback and opinions!
