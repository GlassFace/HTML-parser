 Help me Remember the name!!!
 Alright, So it was about a boy who was made in a lab by his father (working for the evil king). I specifically recall him in a large gas tube. The boy has a white suit that he wears and of course it is weaponized. He uses the suit to defeat the evil king and his army. I remember, one scene where the boy defeats an entire army (of mostly tanks) with the suit. Any one know what im talking about? I watched it in the movie around 2000 if that helps.
