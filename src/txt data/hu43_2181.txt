 Could you suggest some person transformation animes?
 This applies to everyone as a suggestion, the best ones are Creamy Mami and Full Moon where the cute girl transforms into a teen hottie that becomes a big pop star, and Ramna 1/2 where the characters turn into either a cute girl, like Ramna, or an animal, ohterwise Kampfer is very fun to watch too. Sailor Moon, Wedding Peach and Tokyo Mew Mew are types of transforming anime, but it isn't a radical transformation, like gender switching, more like changing into a heroine with super powers or weapons. Then there are the Mermaid anime like My bride Is A Mermaid or Mermaid Melody where the cute girls turn into mermaids when the hit water, of course, and must keep their Mermaid identities secret when they are on dry land.
