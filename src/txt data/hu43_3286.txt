 World never fails to disappoint me.
 https://www.yahoo.com/parenting/dugg...011569557.html The Duggar famil, They got their wish. The Duggar family helped get an anti-LGBT bill get passed in their hometown Fayetteville, Arkansas on Tuesday, Dec. 9. The new bill helped overturn a measure that would have prevented landlords and business owners to evict or fire people based on their gender identity. During the campaign, the Duggars also donated $10,000 to three opponents of the Ordinance 119. Despite the backlash, the couple stood their ground by posting a telling Bible verse on their Facebook page. It read: “We will always stand for truth and the values we hold dear without compromise, but we will do so in love and kindness — treating others well even if we don’t agree with them and we will do so without hateful words.” Fans also created a counter petition. For those of you who do not understand, it goes like this. In that place, there was a Ban on anyone being able to discriminate against anyone based on their sexual orientation. Whether they are Lesbians, Gays, Bisexual, or Transgenders, no one could be kicked out of their home based on the grounds for sexual orientation. You could not fire or hire anyone based on what their sexual preference was, and you could not force a business to close or move to another location, based on the renters preference either. Because of this family, you CAN. At least where they are from. Also, it is completely constitutional according to the verdict of repealing the laws that protected these people. Religion is the Venom that is driving our species into cardiac arrest.
