[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires

Oh, and is the main character still a wimp, if he is then no matter how good the story is I won't be picking it up. I only saw the first episode and he was a wimp there so if that has continued well into the 12th episode I won't pick it up. I have trouble telling if it's good or not honestly, but I think it's very entertaining. A lot of it seems to be Bandai and Sunrise having some fun with the usual mecha tropes. Like, wildcards keep getting thrown in on a regular basis every episode, but it's written well enough that it doesn't feel like it's ever actually jumped the shark. The story itself has gotten a lot more defined, although quite a bit darker as well. The main character, Haruto, hasn't changed a whole lot fundamentally, but he definitely gets stronger as it's progressed. Overall I like it a lot, definitely one of the best shows this season. I'd say watch episode 2 and/or 3 and if it doesn't grab you by then it's probably just not the show for you. It mostly hasn't taken itself too seriously and I think some people may have gotten the wrong impression about it with the way it started. Because of that I think you might have trouble finding a reviewer who is going to be able to give you the sort of analysis you're looking for; how any given person interprets the show is going to strongly rely on how much mecha they've watched, especially stuff like Code Geass or Gundam SEED and similiar.
