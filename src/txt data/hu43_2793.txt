 Scotland Loves Anime!
 Every year for the past 5 years an event is held called 'Scotland Loves Animation' where different animated films are shown over two weekends between Glasgow and Edinburgh. It's predominantly Anime but I think there has been exceptions from time to time. I'm discussing at as a search didn't bring anything up and I wanted to spread the word in case anyone doesn't know about it! This year a few of the 'big' features are DBZ Battle of the Gods, K-The Movie, Lupin 3rd Vs Detective Conan and a special discussion with the President of Studio Bones Masahiko Minami as well as a chance to see two new episodes of 'Space Dandy'. There's lots on and it's always a great turnout. Anyone planning on going? I've already earmarked a couple myself My first year was when One Piece Strong World was showing, not a huge One Piece fan but it was a lot of fun. http://www.lovesanimation.com/
