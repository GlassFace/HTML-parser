[Anime] need more anime in my collection
 As of now the only anime in my dvd collection are sailor moon s1 prt1, the marvel animes (ironman, X-Men, wolverine, and blade) blue drop, bamboo blade, loupes gaurus, appleseed, and lady death. I was wondering if you guys could recommend some anime based on my top five ( sailormoon, clannad, blue drop, shaman king, digimon) or based on the anime I've listed above. Thanx in advance i appreciate the help

 Madoka, if its out yet wixoss. Pokemon for digimon? I guess they are similar. Unfortunately I haven't seen the other shows you mentioned so I can't help there.

 Shadow Skill, Kiba(actually Kiba is very much like Shaman King in so many ways, so much so, It's virtually the same thing, just in a fantasy setting, and with extra elements added to it), and Yu Yu Hakusho are sort of like Shaman King. You want a great drama, slice of life anime, Kemono no souja erin(so great it puts clannad to shame), unfortunately you'll need to pick up a unlicensed Maylasion release sigh, since for some reason the official DvD release, doesn't have a sub option(even though the Japanese themselves subbed the series at day zero, long before the DvD release) Aside from Kemono no souja erin, perhaps check out Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, It's a pretty damn awesome anime. Not really the same thing as Sailor Moon, but perhaps you would like Elemental Gelade, Busou Renken, and Zero no Tsukaima PS. Avoid Pokémon like the plague, It's the same 3 things repeated over, and over again for over 700 episodes.

(looks at sig)Why do I find that hard to believe lol. PS. Oh wait a second, I do know a anime that's a lot like Sailor Moon, the only real difference is, It's not virtually a all female cast, and thankfully there's no one as annoying as Sailor Moon or Sailor Mercury in this. Check out Fushigi Yugi: The Mysterious Play, for such a early Shoujo, It's a damn awesome anime.
