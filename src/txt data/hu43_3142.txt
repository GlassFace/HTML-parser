[General Discussion] Anyone else notice how messed up people are getting now a days?
 These matters have existed as long as civilized society has existed. We only notice it now more because of the prevalence of social media, media in general, as well as the Internet. These three items bring us closer to things happening next door as well as on the other side of the globe. Things, for the most part, have gotten better over time even though it may not always seem that way with the media's portrayal of the world sometimes. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
