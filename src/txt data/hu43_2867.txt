 Hunting for Anime Like This
 Even though I didn't care to much for Lucky Star, I seen similiar animes that I thought were better like Non Non Biyori, Kinomari Mosaic and Is This Order A Rabbit? Today In Class 5-2 is also similiar. Similiar to Host Club but not very alike would be Mayo Chiki and Princess Princess.
