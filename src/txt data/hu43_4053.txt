 Do we have any Rockers in here?
 I was just wondering if there are any Rock/Metal fans in the forum and if so, what are your favorite bands/songs? As for me, my favorite style of music at the moment is Metalcore, but I can listen to just about anything in Alternative, Rock, Metal, R+B, electronic, classical. I can't stand listening to pop, rap and country though. Some of my favorite bands are All That Remains, We Came As Romans, Crown The Empire, and A Day To Remember. I also like Disturbed, Rise Against, My Chemical Romance, Three days Grace, Thousand Foot Krutch, Starset and many, many more. The band that pretty much got me started on this path though was Metallica. Metallica is definitely my all-time favorite band and I don't see that changing anytime soon. I have seen them three times so far, but I hope to see them at least ten more times until they stop touring, that is if they do. It's very hard for me to decide what my favorite songs are, because I pretty much like all the songs of the bands I have listed, with a few exceptions. Right now, some of my favorite songs are Perfect Life by Red, Fade To Black by Metallica, Architects by Rise Against, Burn by Papa Roach, Follow My Voice by For All Those Sleeping, Ten Thousand Fists by Disturbed, and Dark On Me by Starset just to name a few. Thanks for reading this if you made it this far. I just wanted to share some of my interests in music with everyone. I am actually about to go see Seether and Papa Roach tonight!!! I'm really excited!!! Hope everyone else has a good night!!!
