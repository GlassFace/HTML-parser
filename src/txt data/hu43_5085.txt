 Hello :)
 Hi all who are reading this my name Is blake I am 21 and I have watched anime for as long as I can remember. I love discussing the most minute detail to the biggest most obvious things about anime. I like uhh more action/comedy series like bleach, naruto and samurai champloo that get a little more serious at times. but I also like like ecchi and harem or adult if that's how you would describe it. also more violent stuff like elfen lied, high school of the dead and blood-c and mostly anything that I enjoy. my favorite anime are kill la kill, bleach, naruto shippuden, samurai champloo and mardock scramble. my favorite character is luffy from one piece or levi ackerman from attack on titan. sometimes I like mech battles. and whatevers is good. well anyways hi and nice to meet you .
