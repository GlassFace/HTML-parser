 Favorite Mystery Anime?
 Ghost in The Shell, Detective Conan, and Psycho-Pass are some of the best ones I've seen. Murder mysteries are always fun although the cyber punk theme can get a little frustrating at times. Bonus points if you recommend something that is dubbed I know I'm a nub. I'll love you forever if you suggest one that was dubbed all the way through, unlike poor poor Detective Conan. Jerry Jewell was an awesome Jimmy Kudo *sigh*. Seriously I want to learn Japanese so I can watch the other 600 something episodes.
