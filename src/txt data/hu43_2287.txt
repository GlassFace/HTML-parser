 1/3 voters say Obamacare negative impact on them
 One-in-three U.S. voters now says his or her health insurance coverage has changed as a result of Obamacare, and the same number say the new national health care law had a negative personal impact on them. Forty percent (40%) of Likely U.S. Voters have at least a somewhat favorable opinion of the health care law, while 56% regard it unfavorably, according to a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey. This includes 16% who view the law Very Favorably and 41% who have a Very Unfavorable opinion of it. (To see survey question wording, click here.) ... Just 14% of all voters now say they personally have been helped by the law, down from 16% in January. Thirty-three percent (33%) say they have been hurt by the law, up from 29% earlier this year and the highest negative rating since April 2013. Fifty percent (50%) say it has had no impact on them. http://www.rasmussenreports.com/publ...ealth_care_law Of course, many haven't been touched by the law at all yet because mandates have been delayed for employers until after the midterm elections. According to Harry Reid, all of the bad Obamacare stories were just lies. All of them. Lies and liars all because of the Koch brothers who are, in the words of Reid, trying to 'buy' America. I'm waiting for a similar rant over George Soros, who literally started his own media platform, or billionaire Tom Steyer who bought the Virginia Governorship for the Democrats.

 Everyone I ever talked to has negative things to say about it. Although, It may be the result that I am back on the Oregon Health Plan OHP which is free health coverage.

 I'm not sure why anybody would take this survey all that seriously. In the article itself, 47% of Republicans claim off the bat that they have been negatively affected by Obamacare while 62% of Tea Party members also believe that Obamacare has hurt them personally. Compare this to 19% of Democrats claiming that they have been hurt by Obamacare. People's responses were clearly based highly on political affiliation, which anybody could have told you before even reading the article. People are not reporting their personal experiences with Obamacare; they're reporting their feelings about it. Considering the fact that Obamacare horror stories are constantly aired on TV in smear campaigns yet later debunked, that the vast majority of Americans probably couldn't even explain the fundamental basics of Obamacare, and that people's opinions on issues are incredibly easy to manipulate through clever polling and smearing, you can see that this survey is absolutely worthless. These aren't hard numbers showing the program's inefficiency and these aren't concrete verifiable examples of its holes; these are phone calls to people asking what they thought about Obamacare with no followup whatsoever. They called 1000 people, and some of them basically said they did not like the program. I'm seriously laughing at the absurdity of this. Anybody who thinks that this is legitimate evidence against the program is an idiot. Sorry. Here are some articles on instances where people have exaggerated or straight-up fabricated Obamacare horror stories: http://www.salon.com/2014/01/31/gops...art_to_finish/ http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014...tories/356728/ http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013...doctors-wrong/ http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013...are-cost-myth/

Compare this to 19% of Democrats claiming that they have been hurt by Obamacare. Conveniently not mentioned by Buddylee - 35% of independents also made the claim. That would be above the average. So, 19% of Dems and 47% of Repubs...but also a higher percentage of independents...hmm... Considering about 50-60% of the population hasn't been felt the full impact yet because they don't use the individual health insurance market, those are pretty high rates. which anybody could have told you before even reading the article. People are not reporting their personal experiences with Obamacare; they're reporting their feelings about it. Well, I mean, if you say so. I mean, I'm pretty sure you just made an assumption that you can't substantiate, and which won't matter on election day regardless. Considering the fact that Obamacare horror stories are constantly aired on TV in smear campaigns yet later debunked, that the vast majority of Americans probably couldn't even explain the fundamental basics of Obamacare, and that people's opinions on issues are incredibly easy to manipulate through clever polling and smearing, you can see that this survey is absolutely worthless. Yea, those 6.3m policies cancelled compared to the few million they claim to have signed up don't support this evidence at all. My math is fuzzy, but I believe they are actually still at a net loss with a website that is, at best, half functional. So, I"d love to hear about the efficiencies of the program. Especially when early estimates are that the young and uninsurned are, by the best estimates, not the ones signing up. But yes, all GOP lies. Which is why Obama had to backtrack and endorse extensions for the cancelled policies. And why they've delayed the employer mandates. Because it's all just been so efficient. I don't have time at this moment to go through your Think Progress or Salon links at the moment (two of which I've read already, ironically enough), but I'll do so later.

That's consistent among what I've been saying actually. Tea Party people highest, then Republicans, (independents), and least commonly Democrats. The point was not that people are disqualified for being of certain political parties, but rather that there was a clear bias in answering the question. The question was not only whether or not you believe Obamacare is good or bad, but if Obamacare has negatively affected you. For some reason, 62% of Tea Partiers have been personally hurt by Obamacare, compared to only 19% of Democrats. That is a fantastic coincidence if everybody is telling the truth. ...Which they're not. Which was my point. A point I did not need to refer to independents for. Try in the future not to accuse me of leaving out key details until you can fully grasp my arguments! Well, I mean, if you say so. I mean, I'm pretty sure you just made an assumption that you can't substantiate, and which won't matter on election day regardless. Just as you made an assumption about the program's actual effectiveness based off of the testimonials of people on the phone? I think I posted multiple links in which people's claims about Obamacare truly harming their quality of life were busted quite consistently. That was the general point of my message: that phone interviews aren't exactly the best way to get information on an issue like this because it is clear that a lot of people (a) do not understand the program enough to conclude that they have been hurt by it in the long run, or (b) people who have a political agenda and will say anything to express dissatisfaction for Obamacare. Yea, those 6.3m policies cancelled compared to the few million they claim to have signed up don't support this evidence at all.

Especially when early estimates are that the young and uninsurned are, by the best estimates, not the ones signing up. This is extremely misleading information because the cancellations were not effective immediately, as the grace period for the insurers extends into 2015. You're kind of making it seem as if 6 million insured Americans' plans just went poof at the same time, which is simply not true. For programs that fail to abide by guidelines of the ACA, yet hold the grandfathered status, it extends even longer. Citing raw numbers as "programs canceled," as if Obamacare is stripping people of their health insurance, does not tell a very good story in any case. If programs fail to live up to the standards of the new regulations of Obamacare, they will in time, have to be replaced. That is kind of the point of Obamacare. It is for the purpose of regulating the insurance market, which is long overdue for some regulation if you ask me. But yes, all GOP lies. Which is why Obama had to backtrack and endorse extensions for the cancelled policies. And why they've delayed the employer mandates. Because it's all just been so efficient. Delays happen? I'm not sure how this is supposed to be an argument. Much of the reason for the delays was the GOP's resistance. IDK man, you would probably do better to come up with something that holistically considers the nature of Obamacare, its goals, its target public, and actual downfalls of the program. They exist, and in number I'm sure. So far you've presented (1) a useless survey, (2) a number without context that actually does not even really apply yet, and (3) a video of some Democrat ranting about naysayers. If you disagree with the very nature of Obamacare and regulation, that's fine and all, but let's stick to the facts here.

[...] I think this is where a lot of people are right now. Looking for a job is an interesting position to be in right now as I have been inquiring about healthcare plans. Most companies when asked about how their plans might change (if at all) have been giving me a canned response along the lines of: "Our company will always operate within the bounds of the law." 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 Again it's somewhat anecdotal and somewhat not due to the nature of insurance, but I was in the individual market last year before a couple of job hops that took me through a couple of monster tech firms. I had a high deductible plan ($5K) that was canceled by one of the blue cross blue shield companies and replaced by a plan with the exact same deductible and monthly premium with a few extra covered doctor's visits each year. All of that was done by blue cross, blue shield in advance without me having to go to the exchange. As a single, young asian male in the individual market you'd expect I'd pay more than my current share in the brunt of any cost increases but it really didn't pan out that way. I'd expect all the high deductible plans to be gone but they really weren't either, although there probably was a line drawn somewhere on deductibles between 5K and 10K. I'm not sure what different people in different states are experiencing, but it really doesn't fit with my personal experience. So, I'd question how many people actually were hurt by the healthcare law so far. If people were genuinely harmed by it, my guess is that it's maybe married women with kids who will have lower deductible requirements and thus higher premiums right now. That's in addition to the fact their health care requirements typically exceed what single young guys will use so their premiums are naturally a bit higher. I also think the people who never bothered to get insurance in the first place will be "harmed" but those people were always going to face extra costs as a part of this law. Edit: I also hope all these people complaining who have the high deductible plans had that gap covered somehow. It's really a risky proposition to buy an insurance policy with a 10K deductible and not be able to cover that gap. If they had it saved up and their finances worked out, the law really has harmed these people, but I doubt most of the people complaining were like that.

 There are edge cases where Obamacare is actually quite harmful. This generally occurs at the bottom tier of the Middle Class and the upper tier of the Low-Income families. Generally, what's going on is that families who are considered "Low-Income" by all definitions, are benefiting a little more. However, if they straddle the line of Low-Income and Middle Class, a large portion of them have had their premiums go up. The same has occurred with the bottom tier of the Middle Class where their company have dropped them from their own insurance, requiring them to use Obamacare, and they too, have had their premiums go up. For myself, I can clearly state that I have witnessed the above occur. Whether the "1/3rd" claim is true or not, it may have to do with location than anything else. If you call places with a high concentration of Unions... especially places like the Airline industry or, say, Chicago, I would almost assume that you can say "1/3rd" is true. You can also call random places like San Francisco and have a bunch of High-Tech Employees say they didn't see a thing, dropping that 1/3rd to "0".

 I'm sure some people's premiums are going up and some high deductible policies are being eliminated, but realistically the 1/3 claim sounds far-fetched given that Obama care required a lot more people to be entered into the pool of the insured and placed medical loss ratio limits on companies. That's naturally going to drive down premiums but there are other factors that could drive them up. The factors that could don't really apply to that many people though. I'm sure for example people with 10K deductible policies had their plans discontinued and are forced to pick more expensive plans with less deductible. I'm also sure that women pay more for their insurance than men, people with kids pay more than people without, and older people will pay more than younger people. I just doubt that there were that many people in the individual market who meet all these requirements who are really feeling the pinch to qualify as 1/3 of voters. But if someone is a single mid-50s self-employed business woman with a couple of kids and a high deductible plan, yeah, she's gonna take a bit of a hit. It was already expensive for her to pay for insurance though. The numbers sound like BS from Rassmussen, but looking at the anecdotes of people that the republicans hand picked like "Bette from Washington", I have to kind of believe they'll be the ones paying a bit more in the long run just from knowing how the statistics work out. Not sure if the intent was to adversely affect people like that with the law, but chances are, they were the ones not really paying enough in the first place. Edit: Forgot, but as Shian mentioned, if a small employer drops an employee or a large employer drops a retiree from a program they were subsidizing, it's going to be more expensive as well because they were being shielded from the market. I've heard a bit about this and I'm thinking it's because the rules changed on how insurance companies can handle business policies, making them less flexible for insurers, more pricy for businesses. Not real sure though. This might happen quite a bit at small businesses and consulting firms depending on how things go, so I'd be really careful in the tech and the engineering industry. So basically, there should be downward pressure on premiums with the loss ratio and individual mandates. The upward pressure on premiums comes from lower deductibles and small businesses dropping insurance policies if they get too pricy for them to subsidize things for their employees.

 Buddylee Tea Party people highest, then Republicans, (independents), and least commonly Democrats. The point was not that people are disqualified for being of certain political parties, but rather that there was a clear bias in answering the question. The question was not only whether or not you believe Obamacare is good or bad, but if Obamacare has negatively affected you. For some reason, 62% of Tea Partiers have been personally hurt by Obamacare, compared to only 19% of Democrats. That is a fantastic coincidence if everybody is telling the truth. There was little nuance to what you said, and as usual you focused on a single detail while ignoring my point - independents are closer to the Republican side of the issue, and actually a higher percentage than the Rasmussen final result of 1/3. There was also a separate question that asked straight up how favorably people viewed the program which indicated far higher results (56% unfavorable). The question was specifically people to self-report. I wouldn't deny any bias, but it doesn't even really matter how accurate the perceptions are come election day. And I never actually made the point you suggested (the efficiency/success of the program is proven with this single poll). I've posted on this topic in a number of threads at this point, and this was only another in a long line of polls to show people aren't liking this program. The more they are exposed to it, the less they support it. That was the general point of my message: that phone interviews aren't exactly the best way to get information on an issue like this because it is clear that a lot of people (a) do not understand the program enough to conclude that they have been hurt by it in the long run, or (b) people who have a political agenda and will say anything to express dissatisfaction for Obamacare. A-People may not understand the program because, in general, they have been lied to and misled by both sides on the issue. Why, our president got up and lied to the American people just to get it passed. And the bill wasn't even read by lawmakers. And the regulations were kept hidden and developed by bureaucrats who waited until the last minute to even tell the website designers how everything would work. All of this after the Supreme Court had to rewrite the bill. B-Or, get this...a large number of people have had bad experiences so far, and regardless of places like Salon telling people that they simply haven't figured out how to make it 'work' for them (as your link suggested), they don't like it. The question asked their opinion of their own experiences. The entire argument used to defend the issues so far has been nothing but condescending to the public. You are basically saying here that people aren't qualified to determine on their own whether it's been good for them or not. Later in your post you suggest that people who were happy with their insurance plans before were either irresponsible or too ignorant to realize they were actually bad plans. If the defense of your government program is that the public is ignorant and needs to be protected from itself, you may want to rethink that one. Or maybe we need to rethink our entire political process... This is extremely misleading information because the cancellations were not effective immediately, as the grace period for the insurers extends into 2015. You're kind of making it seem as if 6 million insured Americans' plans just went poof at the same time, which is simply not true. For programs that fail to abide by guidelines of the ACA, yet hold the grandfathered status, it extends even longer. There is nothing misleading about it. The original regulations called for those plans to be cancelled, and they were extended for only a year temporarily because of the public uproar that resulted after people realized they had been blatantly lied to by the Democrats and Obama to get the bill passed. That is until today, as it now appears that Obamacare is going to indefinitely grandfather in those plans (whose cancellation you defend later on, which I will address). The reason (again, relevant to something you refer to later in your post)? The cancellation notices for the extended policies would have gone out right before the midterm elections. http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch...p-midterm-dems This thing is being rewritten on the fly for political reasons. And despite your claim that it's because of the Republicans, these changes are being made unilaterally by the Obama administration for political purposes. I can go find you the articles talking about the delays where outlets like Reuters, WashPO, and even the NYT's admit that the motivation is Democrats scared of the midterm election results. Why are they scared if everything is peachy and the horror stories are completely fabricated? If programs fail to live up to the standards of the new regulations of Obamacare, they will in time, have to be replaced. That is kind of the point of Obamacare. It is for the purpose of regulating the insurance market, which is long overdue for some regulation if you ask me. Again, Obama specifically told the public on over 200 occasions, with no qualifications added to the statement, that people would not lose their old plans or doctors. The Democrats repeated this, and accused Republicans who claimed otherwise were lying and spreading misinformation. Sort of like they are doing now. So when you accuse people of being ignorant of the program, look at the Democrats before you blame Fox News/Republicans. This bill would never have been passed without that claim. Beyond that, I'll go back to what I said before. You are saying that consumers, the same people we trust to elect our government officials, aren't qualified or responsible enough (or both) to pick their own insurance plans. They can't decide what sort of coverage they need...instead a government a bureaucrat is more capable of that, or some cookie cutter approach applied to the entire population makes sense... Delays happen? I'm not sure how this is supposed to be an argument. Much of the reason for the delays was the GOP's resistance. I've addressed this, but I want to be blunt and clear - this is a blatant lie. The Dems and Obama administration have instituted these delays unilaterally after *****ing incessantly about it being the law of the land when Repubs wanted concessions. They did it purely for political reasons. Even they themselves claim it's to institute it a smooth manner. Their strategists and consultants are more candid, especially when off the record, and the media doesn't even try to hide it. IDK man, you would probably do better to come up with something that holistically considers the nature of Obamacare, its goals, its target public, and actual downfalls of the program. They exist, and in number I'm sure. So far you've presented (1) a useless survey, (2) a number without context that actually does not even really apply yet, and (3) a video of some Democrat ranting about naysayers. I've done all of this, but let's review some of the goals and failures of Obamacare so far: 1. It's a lousy plan. 2. It was implemented poorly. 3. It's a detriment to the economy. 4. They are woefully short of the target numbers they set out. 5. Early indications are that these are not the groups of uninsured that the bill targeted or needed (the young and healthy) in order to make the financials work the way the Dems said they would. 6. They lied to get the bill sold, because Dems knew full well that the American people, 88% of whom reported to be happy with their health coverage, would not have supported a bill that led to full scale 7. They are still lying about the number of enrollments as a large percentage (estimates vary) haven't actually purchased plans. These people would not meet the industry standard of ensured individuals. Despite the inflated numbers, they are still going to end up millions short of their target. Here's the NYT doing their best to explain away the fact that the majority of small businesses will see premiums rise: http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/0...e-under-a-c-a/ Another NYT article describing the rate shock that is very real for some people already, and which hasn't been experienced by large numbers of Americans who don't participate in the individual market while also dispelling the notion that the cancellations were all 'bad' plans: (Per my online calculations, the subsidized bronze plan for a 50-year-old Connecticut resident making $40,000 costs about $2000 a year. If that same resident takes a job paying $50,000, the same plan, now unsubsidized, will cost $4200 a year  basically a 20 percent marginal tax on climbing just a little ways up the income ladder.) ... If we want health inflation to stay low and health care costs to be less of an anchor on advancement, we should want more Americans making $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 to spend less upfront on health insurance, rather than using regulatory pressure to induce them to spend more. And seen in that light, the potential problem with Obamacares regulation-driven rate shock isnt that it doesnt let everyone keep their pre-existing plans. Its that it cancels plans, and raises rates, for people who were doing their part to keep all of our costs low. http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/201...y-they-matter/ An analysis by The New York Times shows the cost of premiums for people who just miss qualifying for subsidies varies widely across the country and rises rapidly for people in their 50s and 60s. In some places, prices can quickly approach 20 percent of a persons income. Experts consider health insurance unaffordable once it exceeds 10 percent of annual income. By that measure, a 50-year-old making $50,000 a year, or just above the qualifying limit for assistance, would find the cheapest available plan to be unaffordable in more than 170 counties around the country, ranging from Anchorage to Jackson, Miss. A 60-year-old living in Polk County, in northwestern Wisconsin, and earning $50,000 a year, for example, would have to spend more than 19 percent of his income, or $9,801 annually, to buy one of the cheapest plans available there. A person earning $45,000 would qualify for subsidies and would pay about 5 percent of his income, or $2,228, for an inexpensive plan. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/bu...dle-class.html So there are some real Obamacare 'horror stories' from the very liberal, very pro-Obamacare, NYT. We don't have firm numbers yet on a lot of this, and if the administration has them, they aren't releasing them. Tenken If people were genuinely harmed by it, my guess is that it's maybe married women with kids who will have lower deductible requirements and thus higher premiums right now. That's in addition to the fact their health care requirements typically exceed what single young guys will use so their premiums are naturally a bit higher. I also think the people who never bothered to get insurance in the first place will be "harmed" but those people were always going to face extra costs as a part of this law. From everything I've read, the premium rates vary greatly depending on where you are. There seems to be little consistency, and we don't have hard numbers one way or another to show this definitively that I am aware of. They haven't been produced yet, but eventually we will. It is important to note that Obama specifically promised families would see a $2500 savings on average. So, that group you just named as the ones likely to see premium increases (I don't necessarily agree with that) were specifically lied to if that's the case. http://twitchy.com/2013/06/02/flashb...mily-per-year/ That link also discusses the rate shock which was seen in California. One of the NYT articles I posted above discussed the same thing. I don't like anecodotal stories on any of this because it muddies the waters, but there is no denying that in order to get this bill passed the Democrats deliberately misled the American public. This plan was poorly designed and nearly every flaw we are running into was pointed out well before hand. The people who did so were often attacked viciously by the left and accused of trying to scare the public. Well, sorry, but the evidence is piling up that it was the other way around. I've laid out my issues with Obamacare in the past, but to reiterate I consider it a poor plan with even worse execution. The timing was awful, as well. Forgot, but as Shian mentioned, if a small employer drops an employee or a large employer drops a retiree from a program they were subsidizing, it's going to be more expensive as well because they were being shielded from the market. I've heard a bit about this and I'm thinking it's because the rules changed on how insurance companies can handle business policies, making them less flexible for insurers, more pricy for businesses. Not real sure though. This might happen quite a bit at small businesses and consulting firms depending on how things go, so I'd be really careful in the tech and the engineering industry. I think you're referring to what the NYT article on small businesses I posted was talking about. They lose some of their subsidies for health insurance. 
 Oh boy, this is gonna get long unfortunately. There was little nuance to what you said, and as usual you focused on a single detail while ignoring my point - independents are closer to the Republican side of the issue, and actually a higher percentage than the Rasmussen final result of 1/3. There was also a separate question that asked straight up how favorably people viewed the program which indicated far higher results (56% unfavorable). The question was specifically people to self-report. And that's the problem I'm calling out right now. I find it very ironic that you still have not addressed the center of my argument yet claim that I'm ignoring your point. If the point of the poll was to find out how people felt about Obamacare, that's fine, but the title of your thread isn't in reference to the approval ratings of the program. It refers to the claims people have made about negative experiences due to Obamacare. In addition in the opening post you explicitly mention multiple times that Democrats are lying about people having bad experiences on the program. I am simply saying that the poll is worthless in this regard due to the very inconsistent experiences people have had based on their political parties. The argument you very clearly presented was "Obamacare is hurting many people." You explicitly mention that Democrats are just denying this fact, and the main point of your entire first post in the thread is that Obamacare is doing real damage. The methodology of the poll and a closer look at it shows it to be unreliable. You need to present more evidence if you want to convince me that Obamacare has hurt so many people, because right now, I'm finding it difficult to come up with verified horror stories. B-Or, get this...a large number of people have had bad experiences so far, and regardless of places like Salon telling people that they simply haven't figured out how to make it 'work' for them (as your link suggested), they don't like it. The question asked their opinion of their own experiences. Could you try to define bad experiences? Maybe you could refer me to people's specific experiences that have been truly verified as shortcomings in the program? I mean, the Republicans have tried often, but so far it seems to just be Joe the Plumber tactics reborn for Obamacare, referencing people who have been completely ruined by the program, but in review come up short over and over again. If there were such a surplus of people who have truly been ruined by Obamacare, we should be able to do better than a lousy phone survey. The entire argument used to defend the issues so far has been nothing but condescending to the public. While this is very untrue, the public is more confused than anything at this point. You have such a vast amount of misinformation coming from both sides that it is hard to get a true grasp on what the program really does, or what shortcomings it may really have. Any issues with the public's so-called ignorance is that insurance providers intentionally make plans excessively complicated with varieties of fine print and exclusions. The average American, educated or not, is very unlikely to be able to fully comprehend the entirety of any insurance contract he/she signs. Legal jargon is immensely difficult. This is not condescending to the public. This is a reality and a way in which insurance companies have made buying health insurance a daunting task. The issue, I repeat, is not that the public is ignorant; it is that the health insurance buying process is not transparent. Later in your post you suggest that people who were happy with their insurance plans before were either irresponsible or too ignorant to realize they were actually bad plans. If the defense of your government program is that the public is ignorant and needs to be protected from itself, you may want to rethink that one. Or maybe we need to rethink our entire political process... Strawman. Second one thus far. This thing is being rewritten on the fly for political reasons. And despite your claim that it's because of the Republicans, these changes are being made unilaterally by the Obama administration for political purposes. I can go find you the articles talking about the delays where outlets like Reuters, WashPO, and even the NYT's admit that the motivation is Democrats scared of the midterm election results. Why are they scared if everything is peachy and the horror stories are completely fabricated? Too much speculation, conclusions drawn based off of speculation, and in general logical fallacies to even bother with. Beyond that, I'll go back to what I said before. You are saying that consumers, the same people we trust to elect our government officials, aren't qualified or responsible enough (or both) to pick their own insurance plans. They can't decide what sort of coverage they need...instead a government a bureaucrat is more capable of that, or some cookie cutter approach applied to the entire population makes sense... Strawman numero tres. I've addressed this, but I want to be blunt and clear - this is a blatant lie. Well, no, the Republicans and public have been pushing, which they rightfully should be doing, and the Democrats have been reacting. I never said that the reason for the delays was all because of the Republican resistance, but much of the reason for the delays was. If there were no Republican resistance, do you think they would be changing Obamacare this much? That's strawman number four, by the way. 1. It's a lousy plan. 2. It was implemented poorly. 3. It's a detriment to the economy. 4. They are woefully short of the target numbers they set out. 5. Early indications are that these are not the groups of uninsured that the bill targeted or needed (the young and healthy) in order to make the financials work the way the Dems said they would. 6. They lied to get the bill sold, because Dems knew full well that the American people, 88% of whom reported to be happy with their health coverage, would not have supported a bill that led to full scale 7. They are still lying about the number of enrollments as a large percentage (estimates vary) haven't actually purchased plans. These people would not meet the industry standard of ensured individuals. Despite the inflated numbers, they are still going to end up millions short of their target. Good! Points #4 and #5 actually expose large problems with Obamacare that directly relate to low public support. #6 is a bit of Dem bashing, not bad, but #7 while slightly repetitive is not bad at all. You would do better by citing more real numbers and sources, but hey, at least we're working towards a valid argument now. Funny enough I have never been a huge supporter of Obamacare, and would consider myself on the fence at the moment. It is going to depend on how the program plays out over the next while because as you pointed out, if enrollment rates stay low, the program could be a disaster. There is a fine system in place at the current moment, but I could not tell you if the math checks out. I'm currently very happy with my insurance plan as it gave me a huge hospital room and large payout when I was hospitalized last here so Obamacare does not really concern me. 
 I work for a large consumer care company and my insurance for a single male went up approx 18% a month plus increases in some of my deductibles. The way my company explained we can expect similar increases over the next five years just to offset the cost of Obamacare. I have 90/10 Anthem Blue cross blue shield.

It is important to note that Obama specifically promised families would see a $2500 savings on average. So, that group you just named as the ones likely to see premium increases (I don't necessarily agree with that) were specifically lied to if that's the case. http://twitchy.com/2013/06/02/flashb...mily-per-year/ That link also discusses the rate shock which was seen in California. One of the NYT articles I posted above discussed the same thing. I don't like anecodotal stories on any of this because it muddies the waters, but there is no denying that in order to get this bill passed the Democrats deliberately misled the American public. This plan was poorly designed and nearly every flaw we are running into was pointed out well before hand. The people who did so were often attacked viciously by the left and accused of trying to scare the public. Well, sorry, but the evidence is piling up that it was the other way around. I've laid out my issues with Obamacare in the past, but to reiterate I consider it a poor plan with even worse execution. The timing was awful, as well. I think you're referring to what the NYT article on small businesses I posted was talking about. They lose some of their subsidies for health insurance. The thing I think stands out the most in the NYT article is the rating restrictions they have been placing on insurers. Insurance was never really a business where you would pool every risk into a single pool to cover the whole. You pool similar risks into a group to cover just that group, because a nice normal distribution of expenses develops. This is a distribution which you can easily use to base the insurance premium on (by charging enough to cover say 97% of expenses + a bit of profit) and which the variance of potential expenses is well understood. This method is why we've seen premium variation in the past based on things like age, gender, the number of kids you have, and maybe even geography. It's more a fact of statistics than anything. I think it's important to point out there are going to be a few pressures here and there then on which way premiums go. Some things like the loss ratio will help pressure premiums downward, while other things like lower deductibles and the ratings restrictions are going to drive them up for a lot of people. Rates will probably also explode in states where these things don't get reviewed by any state board (i.e. california). I have to agree that ultimately it's like the law was drawn up without really examining all of these things in detail.

Wellpoint/Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield are regularly in the crossfires of suits and not considered desirable or reputable. 

 Buddylee I find it very ironic that you still have not addressed the center of my argument yet claim that I'm ignoring your point. If the point of the poll was to find out how people felt about Obamacare, that's fine, but the title of your thread isn't in reference to the approval ratings of the program. It refers to the claims people have made about negative experiences due to Obamacare. In addition in the opening post you explicitly mention multiple times that Democrats are lying about people having bad experiences on the program. The title of the post is 1/3 of people say they have had been negatively impacted by Obamacare. The common Democratic talking point has been that the stories posted are all false and coming from some Republicans. I've already provided links from liberal sources that describe anecdotal and statistical data on the people who have been negatively impacted. The very ones Harry Reid, one of the five most powerful members of the party, claiming they are all somehow false. Your argument is that because Salon and Think Progress or some other outlets have attempted and in some cases successfully discredited a few anecdotal stories that they these people don't exist. So, yea, when talking about the success of the program, how people feel its impacted them thus far is relevant, and it can't be explained away as Republican propaganda. I am simply saying that the poll is worthless in this regard due to the very inconsistent experiences people have had based on their political parties. There's no gray area with you, is there? 35% of independents also reported negative experiences. Simply pointing to higher Republican totals does not discredit the poll. Nor was I under some obligation to make my initial post a 12 page thesis on Obamacare. I'll gladly back up any claims I make as I've done already. You need to present more evidence if you want to convince me that Obamacare has hurt so many people, because right now, I'm finding it difficult to come up with verified horror stories. Well, you can start with the three links I posted from the NYT. California, for instance, had a great deal of sticker shock: "According to the Los Angeles Times, middle class consumers will face a 30% increase in their premiums." http://www.breitbart.com/InstaBlog/2...-Sticker-Shock State-by-state breakdown where premiums are expected to rise, on averae, 41% in 41 states: http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapoth...ow-to-elderly/ So, you can go back to your Salon article which was pretty short on facts, and simply focused on anecdotal horror stories. I'll stick with the raw data: Todays release, with the third iteration of the map, contains both premium and subsidy data for every state except Hawaii. (Believe it or not, weve had success mining data from every exchange website but Hawaiis.) This nearly-complete analysis finds that the average state will face underlying premium increases of 41 percent. Men will face the steepest increases: 77, 37, and 47 percent for 27-year-olds, 40-year-olds, and 64-year-olds, respectively. Women will also face increases, but to a lesser degree: 18%, 28%, and 37% for 27-, 40-, and 64-year-olds. If there were such a surplus of people who have truly been ruined by Obamacare, we should be able to do better than a lousy phone survey. Let's review some of the linked material from your first post. http://www.salon.com/2014/01/31/gops...art_to_finish/ Didn't actual have any facts, but it did link to other stories it considered valid to discredit Republican mouthpiece "Bettie." It didn't actually debunk anything itself, and then ranted about how Republicans are operating in bad faith. Here's what Think Progress called a 'debunking.' "Mahar found that Johnson, Kecseg and Lusk are all active Tea Party members. Meanwhile, it's extremely unlikely for a 26-year-old to pay $1,000 monthly premium, and anyone following the health care law would know that it limits deductibles for families at $12,700 and $6,350 for individuals. Unfortunately, Berard hadn't been following the Obamacare news. I havent written about healthcare in a long time. We dont have a healthcare writer," she told Mahar. "I cover about 15 other topics."" What they really are talking about is sloppy journalism, but they did not actually disprove anything stated about the plans. Why, that's what many people would call a smear! Another debunking! Her current plan, from Anthem Blue Cross, is a catastrophic coverage plan for which she pays $293 a month as an individual policyholder. It requires her to pay a deductible of $5,000 a year and limits her out-of-pocket costs to $8,500 a year. Her plan also limits her to two doctor visits a year, for which she shoulders a copay of $40 each. After that, she pays the whole cost of subsequent visits...No one benefits when journalists don't dig deeper. CNBC failed to explain to Cavallaro why her plan was substandard So, again, we have the claim that it was just a bad plan, but no actual argument over the price increases she is being forced into. Essentially, the debunking is telling her she was too stupid to decide for herself which plan was good for her. That's not discrediting the story, it's just condescending. And why is it the media's job to explain to someone why a plan they chose as a consumer meets their arbitrary label of 'substandard?' What they are complaining about here isn't even so much sloppy journalism as it is that CNBC didn't endorse Obamacare. They had the nerve to actually report why someone was angry. I don't know why I'm even being forced to addressed biased sources like Salon and Think Progress. Just because you throw up claims saying a few stories were debunked doesn't make it true. Any issues with the public's so-called ignorance is that insurance providers intentionally make plans excessively complicated with varieties of fine print and exclusions. The average American, educated or not, is very unlikely to be able to fully comprehend the entirety of any insurance contract he/she signs. Legal jargon is immensely difficult. This is not condescending to the public. This is a reality and a way in which insurance companies have made buying health insurance a daunting task. And the solution to this is to have bureaucrats in Washington design cookie cutter policies for the entire population? Health care contracts are ridiculously complex. Some people don't understand their policies. The defense of Obamacare that paints everyone unhappy with their lost policies with the same broad brush of ignorance is still extremely condescending. Too much speculation, conclusions drawn based off of speculation, and in general logical fallacies to even bother with. Name one illogical fallacy in that paragraph. I'm not going to go hunt down a half a dozen links that state what the same thing I did when you fail to even address the arguments made. How exactly did the Republicans force Obama to delay anything? Their death grip over the media that would have convinced masses of people that the delayed aspects of the law were bad for them before the elections? That's sarcasm, just so you know! Well, no, the Republicans and public have been pushing, which they rightfully should be doing, and the Democrats have been reacting. I never said that the reason for the delays was all because of the Republican resistance, but much of the reason for the delays was. If there were no Republican resistance, do you think they would be changing Obamacare this much? If people aren't being hurt by Obamacare already, and they could expect to implement the delayed aspects of the law smoothly, why would they delay them at all? Can you answer that question directly without dancing around it or calling strawman? Republicans can complain all they want. If the people impacted by the policy think it's helping them, then it wouldn't matter. Why was the business mandate delayed after Obama met with actual business leaders? Like, the next day? It must have been because they gave him a warm endorsement! And here's the Washington Post reporting on the same reckless speculation for the motives that I and everyone else with common sense was guilty of: As word of the delays spread Monday, many across the ideological spectrum viewed them as an effort by the White House to defuse another health-care controversy before the fall midterm elections. http://www.washingtonpost.com/nation...5fb_story.html Good! Points #4 and #5 actually expose large problems with Obamacare that directly relate to low public support. #6 is a bit of Dem bashing, not bad, but #7 while slightly repetitive is not bad at all. You would do better by citing more real numbers and sources, but hey, at least we're working towards a valid argument now. Again, I'm not going to make every post a total thesis dissecting Obamacare's failures. These are widely reported stories most of which I've even linked to in other topics. #6 is Dem bashing? Washingt Post gives Obama's 'if you like your plan' lie 4 pinnochios: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/...r-health-plan/ Biden acknowledging they are going to fall short of target goals of 7m: http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/...ort-of-target/ Most haven't paid, and more facts on how short they will actually come to their goal: . Those arent enrollments. The administration had hoped to enroll 3.3 million paying customers by the end of the year, which would bring them 47 percent of the way toward their goal of enrolling 7 million paying customers by March 31. Those 2 million sign-ups are not paying customers yet, though the administration would like to give the impression that they are enrollees. Anecdotal reports suggest that only 5-15 percent of sign-ups have actually paid their first premium and are in fact enrolled. http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelc...ent-of-target/ Only 700k sign up in February, a decline from past months. Figure stood at 4m total, 3m shy of target. The young people necessary to sign up are woefully short of expected totals the CBO estimated they needed to make this financially sustainable: For months, administration officials embraced CBO estimates anticipating that 18- to 34-year-olds would comprise roughly 40% of the total. The current number is about 27%. http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com...-revised-goal/ The majority of those who have signed up had insurance before, according to the Wall Street Journal. We don't have exact figures because like with everything else, the Obama administration has refused to release those figures: A report in The Wall Street Journal this weekend suggests a possible reason behind the reticence: The majority of sign ups appear to be from people who were already insured. Early signals suggest the majority of the 2.2 million people who sought to enroll in private insurance through new marketplaces through Dec. 28 were previously covered elsewhere, raising questions about how swiftly this part of the health overhaul will be able to make a significant dent in the number of uninsured. Insurers, brokers and consultants estimate at least two-thirds of those consumers previously bought their own coverage or were enrolled in employer-backed plans. http://reason.com/blog/2014/01/21/mo...-obamacare-alr Only 1/3 of young uninsured reported they would buy health care plans: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/...m_politics_pop I think I've posted more than enough hard data to back-up the topic's original claim and everything else I've argued in this and other threads. Obamacare is failing to do nearly everything promised. It's not attracting the uninsured, which it hasn't even dented. It's not even addressing those 'substandard' policies that liberals spent the last few months harping on. It hasn't made anything more affordable, and in fact did the opposite in most cases. And 30 aspects of the law were unilaterally delayed by the Obama administration. Tenken I think it's important to point out there are going to be a few pressures here and there then on which way premiums go. Some things like the loss ratio will help pressure premiums downward, while other things like lower deductibles and the ratings restrictions are going to drive them up for a lot of people. Rates will probably also explode in states where these things don't get reviewed by any state board (i.e. california). I have to agree that ultimately it's like the law was drawn up without really examining all of these things in detail. The figures we've seen, though, indicate these aren't 'some' cases, but the majority. And when this plan was drawn up, it's important to remember that this was a bill crafted entirely by the Democratas they boxed the Republicans out of the process early on, and lobbyists helped write it. It was passed with few knowing what it actually contained. Who in their right mind thinks that's a smart way to overhaul health insurance for the entire nation? Ian Like I feel for you if you have no other insurer options, but honestly you made a huge mistake by ending up in Wellpoints system to begin with. Not that I'm blaming you for that anyway; I'm assuming you chose them based on working for them or one of their subsidiaries, but yeah. Wellpoint/Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield are regularly in the crossfires of suits and not considered desirable or reputable. Shocking. Another blanket statement. If we are going to use anecodatal accounts, it's the same group Tenken had, and he said his premiums stayed the same. Maybe, just maybe, it's not the evil coorporation, but a poorly designed law that actually caused those problems? I've already linked to a NYT article on a study that found most small businesses would see premiums rise.

Wellpoint/Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield are regularly in the crossfires of suits and not considered desirable or reputable. Just so we're clear I should of stated my completely liberal biased employer is who explained this to us during our annual benifits renewal meeting. I mean i had Civil Rights day off paid (or as most idiots call it MLK day). This company is so far into the gutter of liberalism (and not liberalism in the classic sense of the word no the new world twisted and perverted mentally defective kind which has lost all sense of the original meaning) we have a diversity week coming up and guess the only demographic not included..... thats right the heterosexual white male, I'm boycotting the whole proceedings. 
 I think it's entirely possible a company like Wellpoint does whatever the hell they want though and issues statements to blame who they like. Even without Obamacare, as we all get older our premiums will go up. It's the nature of the game. Your premium is based in large part off what your expected health care expenses are. All that said, I still think the ratings restrictions is really bad logic, because it seems like it would be hard to understand the variance of the pool if you put everyone in one pool. and I'm curious to know exactly how they made it into the bill. If I could point to one thing that will drive rates up for a lot of people, this will be it.

Premiums were already increasing rapidly before Obamacare, and on this forum in the past I've attacked corporations for using Obamacare as an excuse not to hire. I've seen stories of insurance companies using and skirting the ACA already. The biggest issue I have is that this bill won't do what it was really intended to...that is, it won't give insurance to the uninsured. It already hasn't. One study (that I linked to) found that only 11% of enrolllees on the exchanges already had insurance. We have no idea how many newly eligible individuals have signed up for Medicaid, but the numbers don't appear to be large. If they didn't grandfather in those cancelled plans until (now) 2016, we would be looking at a net loss of the insured. The original plan would have resulted in MORE uninsured...The level of ineptitude is undeniable, yet people keep trying to sweep it under the rug. Polls continue to show that the target audience of Obamacare (the young and/or uninsured) don't plan or want to buy anything. And the polls keep getting worse. And all of this regulation was passed in the middle of the worst recession we've had since the 1930's. The argument over whether this was done competently or 'efficiently' should be over, and the real discussion should be how to fix this mess. 
 Brocheta, you've come up with several points that create a very convincing case against the ACA. I'm actually in complete agreement with quite a few of your ideas, so good job. There's no gray area with you, is there? 35% of independents also reported negative experiences. Can you get the whole thing about independents out of your head? Some independents lean far right, and others lean far left. That is not the point of my message at all. I've explained it to you three times now and you still don't get it, so I'll just give up as for now. Anyway, this thread seems to be ending as nothing more than a test of persistence, which I will not be bothered to take part in again. Only this time the funny thing is we actually agree on most general issues. I mentioned two problems, which are (1) many of the horror stories reported by the media were actually false, and (2) the survey is generally worthless. Dems will under report horror stories, Repubs will over report them, and independents will go either way depending on their political leanings. This is why telephone surveys are not regarded so seriously. As for the whole "condescending the public" thing goes, I do believe that some people who believe they have been truly wronged by Obamacare have come out closer to even, depending on their premium costs, out of pocket expenses, and a combination of all factors involved. Obamacare does seem to have some enormous holes in it--you went over them well in your post--but cases have been verified to be misreported. You in the original post jumped onto the idea that everybody who claims that Obamacare screwed them over is telling the whole truth, but upon further investigation there's clear evidence of people fabricating and exaggerating stories. You've done what I asked now, which was giving raw statistical data to show that Obamacare negatively affects a large portion of the public, so again, I agree. It unfortunately took you half a dozen strawmans and other logical fallacies to get there, but what really matters is you got there I guess.

All that said, I think the ratings restrictions would survive being revisited. I really think the individual mandate will be the target, which seems kind of like the wrong target. To me, I think more it's important we have enough money to pay for the whole pool of health care expenses for people in the US however we do it, but I think targeting the individual mandate won't do quite as much as the community rating type changes they made. Again, it's because of statistics. I think having a good control over how the different insurance pools work and subsidizing the pre-existing conditions and high risk pools is a better idea than throwing everyone into one pool and trying to figure out how much money you'll need to adequately cover the costs of the pool. This is actually how I thought the bill would originally work because it gets the uninsured people who are sick covered by some form of insurance. Unfortunately, I really think we'll continue to see strong pushes against the individual mandate... If that happens you can kind of guarantee both sides don't really get it.

 I really think the individual mandate will be the target, which seems kind of like the wrong targe When you say this, what exactly do you mean? From the way things are shaping up right now, I'm pretty sure the exchanges and individual mandate are here to stay. What I think the Democrats are going to have to do politically is: 1. Keep the grandfathered plans. If Clinton or whoever is elected, they are going to going to have to make that decision by 2017. 2. I think the employer mandates would be far more likely to go to the wayside than the individual mandate which is only being watered down. Either way, the changes they've made could prove disastrous. It was politically expedient to extend the old plans which liberals argued were substandard before switching their tune, but this entire bill was designed to throw everyone into the same pool. They get the same coverage. The insurance companies designed the plans on the exchanges thinking that they were going to get the people with those cancelled plans at the higher rates. Combine that with the underwhelming registration numbers and demographics that we may end up with, and the entire plan falls apart financially. That whole death spiral thing becomes a reality for insurance companies. This is also where the cynic in me wonders if the Obama administration isn't counting on the insurance companies and states to cancel these plans on their own. That way they can at least deflect some of the blame. As it is, some people lost their plans anyway. To me, I think more it's important we have enough money to pay for the whole pool of health care expenses for people in the US however we do it, but I think targeting the individual mandate won't do quite as much as the community rating type changes they made. Again, it's because of statistics. I think having a good control over how the different insurance pools work and subsidizing the pre-existing conditions and high risk pools is a better idea than throwing everyone into one pool and trying to figure out how much money you'll need to adequately cover the costs of the pool. This is actually how I thought the bill would originally work because it gets the uninsured people who are sick covered by some form of insurance. This would have been a far simpler approach, right? To address the minority without screwing with the majority. At the very least use incremental changes. People can spin it however they want. The Democrats lied through their teeth to get this passed. From their 50m uninsured claim to the infamous Obama line. 
 I have been against Obamacare from the beginning but now that I see what it has done to my insurnace and others where I work, well, I'm against it even more. In previous years, I had HMO coverage at 100% - copays. This year, the company completely switched their policies. Only two companies to choose from and two types of accounts: Option 1: Company puts x in your account and that's all you've got for the year. Option 2: You and the company put x in your account and you get it back at the end of the year. Option 1 costs more as the company is essentially footing the bill. Option two doesn't cost as much but you're paying for it out of your own pocket with some money thrown in from the company. All I can say is that it's a damn good thing I wound up in the hospital last year, for the raw bills added up to $300,000. My total cost out of that is around $3,000, so I can't complain. As of January 1st of this year, I have $640 to play with and it has to last all year. Guess I'm not going to the doc's office much this year, which is the exact opposite of what I should be doing. To add to my not liking Obamacare, one of the security guards at my company just had his plan cancelled by his insurance. Not for lack of payment, not for going over max costs, not for being in poor health, but because Obamacare deemed his policy against the law due to its coverage options. Now he's scrambling to fill out paperwork to get a new policy as the law in MA states that every person must have health insurance, and he knows that the coverage he's going to wind up getting isn't anywhere near what he was getting before. This isn't hyped up lies, this is very real and I know I'm not the only one that has to put up with this. More and more this is pointing to a system where everything works as long as you don't get sick, and that is not a viable system for everyone at some point will be needing serious health care. 
As I am, so shall ye be. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/GCIACST/ www.gciacst.com
 So, it came out today that the HHS tried to hide the fact that they've basically gutted or suspended the individual mandate in last week's delay of the cancelled policies. This latest political reconstruction has received zero media notice, and the Health and Human Services Department didn't think the details were worth discussing in a conference call, press materials or fact sheet. Instead, the mandate suspension was buried in an unrelated rule that was meant to preserve some health plans that don't comply with ObamaCare benefit and redistribution mandates. Our sources only noticed the change this week. That seven-page technical bulletin includes a paragraph and footnote that casually mention that a rule in a separate December 2013 bulletin would be extended for two more years, until 2016. Lo and behold, it turns out this second rule, which was supposed to last for only a year, allows Americans whose coverage was cancelled to opt out of the mandate altogether. ... But amid the post-rollout political backlash, last week the agency created a new category: Now all you need to do is fill out a form attesting that your plan was cancelled and that you "believe that the plan options available in the [ObamaCare] Marketplace in your area are more expensive than your cancelled health insurance policy" or "you consider other available policies unaffordable." This lax standard—no formula or hard test beyond a person's belief—at least ostensibly requires proof such as an insurer termination notice. But people can also qualify for hardships for the unspecified nonreason that "you experienced another hardship in obtaining health insurance," which only requires "documentation if possible." And yet another waiver is available to those who say they are merely unable to afford coverage, regardless of their prior insurance. In a word, these shifting legal benchmarks offer an exemption to everyone who conceivably wants one. http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/...607325596.html So, yea...Obamacare is dead. In other news, estimates are that of the 4.2m enrolled, as many as 1.1m may not have paid. Not exact figures yet. The February enrollment failed to live up to White House hopes of a late 'surge' to bring them up to the lowered expectation of 5.7m. Didn't happen. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti...inal-goal.html 50% of the people who shopped on the exchanges reported that they wouldn't buy plans because they were 'too expensive' despite qualifying for subsidies. Meanwhile, a McKinsey & Company survey reports that a mere 27% of people joining the exchanges were previously uninsured through February. The survey also found that about half of people who shopped for a plan but did not enroll said premiums were too expensive, even though 80% of this group qualify for subsidies. Some substantial share of the people ObamaCare is supposed to help say it is a bad financial value. You might even call it a hardship. There is no longer an individual mandate, which means the make-believe idea of Obamacare providing universal health coverage is dead in all but name.

 Well, I was completely wrong about who would first make the individual mandate a casualty.

 You know, I'm really buying into the whole this was designed to fail on purpose idea. Removing the individual mandate defeats the whole purpose, and some Democrats are currently running on the platform that the the reason its failing is they didn't go progressive/liberal enough with this. The push for single payer will begin in a few years. You called the individual mandate thing, Tenken. I didn't think they would have the gall to do this, but as far as I can tell it isn't picking up much attention from the media.
