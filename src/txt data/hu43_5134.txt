 Guide to Anime for Beginners and even Experts!
 A compilation of information for those who are just beginning to enter the world of Anime/Manga/Japanese or even those who have been in the world for awhile now. "100 most essential words in Anime and Pronouns" - Thread OP: Vampire Lowell. Source (WAS): http://www.yale.edu/anime/glossary.html , however, it's now a dead link. Not sure what happened to that website. *shrug* "Japanese Honorifics - A very basic lesson - Suffixes" - Thread OP: KT Samurai. Source: Various A4 users: KT Samurai, BuddyLee, and symph lizard. If there are any threads that would be beneficial to put here, please shoot me a pm with a link to the thread. Thanks!
