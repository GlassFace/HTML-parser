 Soul Eater
 i haven't got it yet, but i just ordered the whole series on DVD (the complete set just came out on Amazon for $40. It says 51 episodes on the box so you can probably ignore the way the description says its only 650 minutes long). near as I can tell they combined Bleach and The Nightmare before Christmas. Basically the grim reaper had some problems with soul eating monsters and needed some help, so he opened a school. There are the trainee reapers or meisters and then there are oher kids who become weapons like scythes and such. They battle and then devour the evil souls, monsters, witches, zombies, etc. and gain power along the way. Seemed worth a buy. I have yet to see anything where the Grim Reaper as a person wasn't pretty darn cool.
