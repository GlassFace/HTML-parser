 Dark Souls 2 death journal
 Well Dark Souls 2 is finally out! As a returning player I am happy to say that it made huge improvements after the first first dark souls. This thread is for telling your experience and help. Right now I'm using an estoc for my dex character and estoc is a very good weapon since you can get it right away. So far I'm working on two characters. One has high dex level 45 and wields dual rapier (one from blacksmith)the special attack when dual wielding is very effective early levels but I'm still testing the character out. The other one is strength build wielding a mace planning to have it as pure strength build level 54 with elite knight armor set offers good def and poise early level. I'm surprised that weapon from the black smith is actually good this time.

 Well I've got over 60 hours put into the game already and am at level 140, so I'm pretty well outfitted, though I haven't even finished my first playthrough so there's much more to do. Currently wearing the faraam armor set (the set from the trailers, box art, etc.) all of which is +6-7, using a mastodon greatsword +10 and a shield (greatshield when I'm wearing the right rings -- higher equip load). I've got a STR/FTH build for some good ol' greatsword and lightning spear action, as well as a little pyromancy.

 Did anyone find the use for petrified something? Or is it just like the pendant from dark souls again? 
Fool me once shame on you fool me twice f*ck you Patches 
 Unfortunately no, not yet. I did read that it can be dropped in the bird nest at the beginning for something, but I'm sure that's not the best options. Put about 15 hours into it now and managed to get a Bastard Greatsword. Not gonna be the fastest player as I haven't even gotten to the Last Giant yet but I'm happy taking my time and exploring the story.

You give it to the crows in the tutorial area (Things Betwixt) like the smooth and silky stones and they'll give you one of a number of different items in return, chosen at random. It's basically just a smooth and silky stone that has no other use besides trading, but you probably have a greater chance of getting one of the more useful items, like some twinkling titanite, a titanite slab, or the demon's great hammer.

If you spent 15 hours and have a bastard greatsword I think you can beat the boss with ease I don't think there isn't much to do for 15 hours before the boss fight that unlocks most of the area Also not sure if everyone knows this LEVEL UP YOUR ADAPT this makes you drink and consume your items faster also it helps you raise your shield faster it gives extra poise too. 
Fool me once shame on you fool me twice f*ck you Patches 
 Yeah, the sword paid for itself last night when I managed to defeat the Last Giant, the Pursuer and the Dragonrider within a short sitting. I have heard the same thing about Adapt and have already put a few skills into that section.

 Don't bother putting much more than 10 points into ADP. I had 20+ before respeccing and the difference is negligible. It only adds about 2 invincibility frames to your roll at 99 ADP too, unlike what we were lead to believe pre-release. Lots of people are starting to do tests to see just what exactly ADP does, and if it's worth putting any points into at all. You're mostly better off just putting points into vitality to increase your equip load, making it easier to equip more while remaining under 70% for the fast roll. Also, after 80 or so hours I completed my first playthrough last night. The endings was...well, you'll see it for yourselves. I don't know if I'm going to focus on ranking up in covenants (only done with sunbros so far) next or if I should just get started on my NG+ run right away. My soul level and memory are probably too high at this point for a lot of the pvp covenants, so maybe I'll do the PVE one and then go onto NG+.

 I've actually never played this. As such, I don't understand the attraction.

 I'm thinking of joining the Blue Sentinels covenant for pvp but I'm not sure if it's more popular than the invade covenant (don't know the name) anyone know a good covenant that has plenty of pvp? Also for my strength character the large club is very good since it has scaling like the claymore not sure if anyone found a weapon that has better scaling than the club but so far it has the best scaling. I'm thinking of stop leveling my vigor till 50 and my strength 50 or 45.

 The Bell Keeper or Rat King covenants provide the fastest pvp. You get constantly summoned (or summon others). The Blue Sentinels is dead. Barely anyone is getting summoned. The biggest reason for that is because the Brotherhood of Blood covenant is dead due to their being few benefits to it, and better, faster pvp covenants exist. They rely on each other, so when one is dead the other is too.

 Isn't ADP a way to reduce your hitbox size? 

 Originally Posted by Ian the Korean Isn't ADP a way to reduce your hitbox size? Nope. It just increases the speed you use your estus flask (rather, decreases the time you stand there not doing anything after you drink it), makes you raise your shield faster, roll sooner after being hit, increases poise and resistances. It was supposed to do more, but a number of gameplay features didn't seem to make it to the full game that were seen in the beta, and some aspects of adaptability were some of those features (or were misrepresented, such as how we do gain invincibility frames on our roll from adp, but even after leveling it to 99 we only get 2 or so).

 Originally Posted by 어진혁 The games barely came out and the covenants are dead already? Great hell some covenants in dark souls is still popular More that they haven't really come alive yet. Not a lot of people are invading in their first playthrough, when they're just trying to find everything, figure the game out, etc. More and more pvp will be happening in the coming weeks.

I hope they do I'm dying to make pvp build with the large club. Still I'll do that later I need to finish the game I didn't even get the second lord souls yet...

 Give it some time. The game has only just come out and it'll take a bit for people to find the gear they feel comfortable with and the best locations it will be to pvp. There's also alot of secrets that I'm guessing will be discovered as time goes on.

 I'm trying to look for every possible unique dual wield wepons so far it's dagger, rapier, sword (one you get with sword man class not scimatar), long sword and mace I heard the large club is possible with 50 or 60 strength but I highly doubt it. Also the iron keep is such a good place to farm souls for level 70 thru 100 I cleared the are several times around 3 or 5 and ended with about 30k souls

 Most things can be used in power stance as long as they're the same weapon type. Even big two-handed weapons. You just need 1.5x their required stats to use them in power stance. Dual greatswords is just ridiculously silly.

 I'm in the blue convenant and have only been summoned once. At least we killed the invader. But only once is weird.

 Royal Rat Vanguard is so frustrating! I get him to 1/4 health and it always turns into a hoard festival. 
 Began my NG+ playthrough a few days ago, but didn't get back to it until last night. Gotten pretty far. Haven't taken down any of the old ones yet, but I've progressed in three of the areas just about right up to each of them, so when I start taking them down, three of them will go down in quick succession. Hoping to get to NG++ pretty quick so I can plat DS2 and take a well-deserved break.

 I'm looking to plat this game as well. Just haven't had the time to sit down and really sink my teeth into it due to an insane amount of school work. Wouldn't mind trying to play with someone else who has it on PS3.
