[Anime] titan science
 im a fan of attack on titan ( just like the most of you on this website), so if one has titan shifting ability's, how is the titan formed, i doubt that Eren is able to compress a 15 meter giant inside of his body, no less of bertolts 50 meter titan. is it that their able to transmute matter.
