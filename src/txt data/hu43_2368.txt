 Just started watching anime and looking for reccomendations
 I started watching anime because I was interested in the NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst video game but had never seen the show. I thought I should check it out and I LOVED it. It is my favorite anime so far except for the filler episodes which can be painful. So far I've seen all of the dubbed episodes but am in the middle of an terribly painful sea fairing filler ark I've also checked out Death Note which I thought was awesome for the 1st half or so, but much less interesting in the second half after a certain character I really liked died. I've seen much of Full Metal Alchemist (both versions) and though I thought it was a very well made production I couldn't really get into it and really only liked the Edward character. I tried to watch One Piece but it seemed really silly and kiddy to me, though I plan to give it another chance at some point. I'd appreciate any other recommendations for anime that has an English dub available.
