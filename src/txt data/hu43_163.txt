 End of gay ban in U.S. military a step closer
 Originally Posted by CBC News The U.S. House of Representatives voted Friday to pass a defence bill that includes a provision overturning the law that prevents openly gay men and women from serving as members of the U.S. military. The House voted 229-186 in favour of the bill that would repeal the gay ban  commonly known as the "don't ask, don't tell" policy  that has been in effect since 1993. The defence bill goes to the U.S. Senate for consideration this summer. A heated fight over the lifting of the ban is expected. The amendment that would bring an end to "don't ask, don't tell" is just a small part of an omnibus defence bill which provides more than $700 billion US in funding for military programs. Supporters are hoping the ban repeal would survive its passage through the Senate. "I believe a majority of the Senate, just like a majority of the country  favour changing this policy," said Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee. Levin told a Friday news conference that opponents who try to filibuster the bill would also be holding up money for anti-terrorism programs, new ships, planes and armoured vehicles.
