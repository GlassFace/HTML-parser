[Personal Life Discussions] College Studies, What are You Enrolled For?
 For me, a degree will probably help me get a better paying job. I am studying Communications with an emphasis in Digital Media. As for the cost, I am lucky in the fact that my grades were good enough that I was able to get a grant. I only took out a single loan this quarter because the grant money is almost gone and this is my last quarter. I only borrowed $1,500 so that will be my only debt once I graduate. As for classes, I am taking Business and Society, Intro to Women's Studies, and China After 1800. The women's studies class bothers me because they are telling me that because I am white and male, I oppress people simply by existing. That class is heavily politicized. But these courses are the last of my prerequisites because my work in my major is already done. Graduation this year! 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
