 New PLD Rules, Regulations, & Guidelines
 Welcome back to the newly formed Personal Life Discussion sub-forum! Did you miss it? We bet you did. PLD is intended to give members of the community a place to open up and connect with others. If you're having a bad day, have a problem you don't know how to deal with, or just want some advice, PLD is the place to go. Sometimes it's good to discuss a difficult issue and see what other people have to say about it, and if you're lucky you'll get a comforting word or even a helping hand. It's important to note that while PLD has come back things are not returning to the way they were. And though we now recognize this sub-forum's importance to the community there were many legitmate problems with it that we are not interested in having again. As such, there will be some changes. The previous iteration of PLD was disorganized and haphazard, a perfect breeding ground for heated arguments, teasing, and all-out trolling. This time around we're taking things a lot more seriously. We're genuinely interested in giving people a place to seek advice and help, and anyone who tramples on the kind of trust involved in something like that will not be tolerated. Moderation in PLD will be much more stringent than it is in other parts of the forum; moderators have been instructed to be less reserved with doling out infraction points and even bans. The short version:PLD is back!It's a way more serious place.Moderators are a lot meaner here.
