[Action] Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan) - Page 4
 I may watch the 6th episode just to see how our main character survives, and not sure why you put those is black marks Ian, the episode has already come and pass we're now allowed to give spoilers on the anime after it has have already aired. We're not allow to give spoilers on the manga though.

 The episode literally just aired a few days ago, at least spoiler really blatant things like character deaths until the 6th episode is out. Also: 

 Okay, so I know this isnt relatedbutstillkindarelatedtothetopicathand. But doesn't old dude kinda remind anyone of the Guildmaster from fable? Anyone? No? okay...  Spoiler On a more related-related note, I was introduced to Attack on Titan by Sawyer Last week and then Gigguk fully Influencing me on to watching it (much like Baccano ) . And I have to say HOE-LAY B@LLS!! I have not been blown away by an anime in a long time. Though I am somewhat worried that It'll be the peak of good anime in 2013. 
 Ep 5 Man this show owns so much . I haven't seen a show with such a pessimistic grim view of humanity, and that's what makes it awesome. Putting us in the right place cuz we do have a huge ego about ourselfs. It's also interesting to note there is a huge unexplored world out there beyond the walls that makes this show even the more interesting as far as exploration in the series goes. Definitely some cool stuff beyond the walls to be expected.  Spoiler The thought of them having human intellect is absolutely terrifying as it would mean almost certain annihilation, thought luckily this seems to be an individual thing as the teacher explained. So every titan is the same but there are essentially these mutated titans that are different from the rest of the crowd. I didn't like the idea of the titan disappearing like that. It seems a bit silly I was expecting it just to be fast. From what the teacher described, the titans seem to be almost unnatural which gives me the idea that they were created.

 Heh, so I'm currently starting on this anime season after dealing with College and other stuff. Watched the first episode of this series looks interesting so far. I'm currently more hooked onto Devil Survivor but I'll have to judge after I see all of the current aired episodes of this series. Also these are hilarious THERE ARE SO MANY! THE OPENING GOES WITH EVERYTHING!!!!  Spoiler  Spoiler

 Been meaning to start on this since I've read the manga some years ago, and I finally marathoned all five episodes in one go today. I really like how the anime is really getting to the point and changing the story telling to a chronological order instead of having flashbacks in the middle of a crisis.  Spoiler Not sure how much they will cover seeing as they did not show background flash backs for Annie, but instead only a few mentions of her father.

 Don't post manga spoilers like that at all, please. Someone could start a manga thread in an appropriate subforum if they wanted to talk about stuff thats happened in it.

 Anime spoilers from the latest episode, but too funny not to share:  Spoiler 

 Episode 6 pretty much summed it up.  Spoiler Mikasa definitely wants Eren's D 
 Anybody else feel like the episodes just end way too quick? -_- Honestly, I might just start reading the manga. But still, I cant wait to see Mikasa's reaction  Spoiler when she finds out about what happened to Eren

 Episode 6 was great yet again. I hoped it would'nt be all flashbacks and the part that was kicked ass...Eren did good in my book as a cool character. The stuff he did back then and now earned him some creds along with Mikasa. Anddddd whe have to wait another week for 25 minutes off awesomeness 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 

 This song is good but not, maybe I just heard it so much it's dull on my ears but it goes with freaking everything...how the hell does that even happen?

 I've started watching this one and it's definitely one of the best I have seen in quite a while. First episode was a wee bit gruesome for me, but after that, it becomes less so.  Spoiler The titan eating Eren's mom was the worst, I was just thinking "Noooooooo." The latest episode was really good. Was definitely not expecting that.  Spoiler Referring to child Eren being a total ****ing badass Haha @ the spoilers Ian posted. Very funny.

 Just read the manga up to 45 and I'm lookin forward to watching the anime now 

 I allready wondered what kind of ava Lu the Great Space Pirate had, cause it was certainly Shingeki no Kyojin related...after seeing episode 7 I think I understand it a little more lol... Man, I just can't stand the wait, this episode didn't even end all that exciting but the show is so freaking amazing that I'm thinking about reading the manga during my day off tomorrow. 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 Originally Posted by Genesis Rhapsodos Just read the manga up to 45 and I'm lookin forward to watching the anime now Same. Just caught up a day or so ago, and it's one of the more engaging manga I've read--actually, the most engaging I've actually ever read. For every trickle of information the story gives you, it raises numerous questions, and leaves you aching for more info. While the art of the manga is pretty terrible, the story is top notch--let's hope that it's maintained up until and beyond all current questions are answered. I've yet to get around to watching the anime, but I hope to get to it tonight. Rivaille's ****ing boss, btw. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 ^ At least you can get an avatar that doesn't spoil the anime. I've also caught up, I still find the story lacking greatly, and Eren character is kind of an open book who just likes to shout, the other characters though aren't as opened. What I actually find most interesting is the art style. My favorites character is still Potato Girl and always will be, found the gifs of that fateful scene. Other wise the manga is still way wordy and kind of a jumble mess. That's my review of it and I'll be sticking with the anime, kind of hard not to when it has such epic scenes even if they aren't carried through. And the jokes in the manga/anime are actually funny, I kind of wish there were more for the comic relief cause after a while you feel the same right with them so it's always good to relief that. Also this: Ecchi warning but funny as hell. Shingeki no Shimapan  Spoiler

 This episode turned out to be really good, since I was spoiled for one portion of the anime I didn't think I'd be as excited to see the part I was spoiled on but that really wasn't the case, God those fight scenes were beast. 
 Yeah I'm really pleased with this episode. I think the best scene was the supply corp trapped in that base and how the one soldier with the gun resolves his predicament. Just very solid storytelling showing the kind of crushing despair the characters are experiencing without even directly facing a titan. The pomegranate addition was especially good too; there's a buddhist story about a giant learning to eat them instead of humans, as well as the older fables, like the Greek story of Persephone making it a "fruit of the dead" so to speak. They did a fantastic job with "abnormal" titan as well. Seeing him box off the enemy titans entire head and just brutally crush what was level was really cathartic.
