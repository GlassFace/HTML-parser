 I can't stop playing these games, even after all these years.
 Okay, stop being so ashamed, what old games do you still play that you can't let go of? Diablo and Diablo 2 (plus expansions) - I have this on PC, I got the battle chest for free from working at Activision, you get two free games every year. My Diablo 2 account is active - so if you still play too, look me up~! I'm on East coast servers. I remember my friend renting this for her ps1, uggh it's not the same as pointing and clicking. Warcraft Humans vs. Orcs - If it weren't for dosbox this game would be lost to me. There is something about those little sprites just running around and building things. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 - I will always love the game that introduced Tails to me. I still play this game when the mood strikes (which is often) as tails, or I'll connect it with Sonic & Knuckles and play as Knuckles. Altered Beast - When I bought my Sega Genesis this was the game that came with it. Again, when the mood strikes... There is this one area that gets me frustrated, you turn into a bear in this level and you're in a cave fighting ants or something that have their stingers pointing out. You'd have to jump from one platform onto another and you just end up falling in the stupid hole in the ground. This level: And who can forget this? These stupid Jelly things Would end up like this: Sorry the picture is not bigger, but you get the idea.
