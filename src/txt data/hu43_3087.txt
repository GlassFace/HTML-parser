 Kiki's Delivery Service Disney Dub with "I'm Gonna Fly" and "Soaring"
 Hey all, i was just wondering if it was possible for someone to take the current Disney Dub of Kiki's Delivery service, and splice in the songs from the cersion Carl Macek made. The reason for this is that i grew up watching Carl Macek's version, and while i haven't heard the Streamline dub in years (and been told that the dub is terrible) i still love the music they did for it, as it fit perfectly with what the story was about. Thank You!
