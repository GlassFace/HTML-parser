[Anime] Favorite Anime Soundtrack
 What's your favorite anime soundtrack? I love all things Joe Hisaishi but for the sake of this thread I'll stick to tv shows. My favorite soundtrack from a TV show is probably Angel Beats, although Bleach had an amazing soundtrack through its million seasons it got.
