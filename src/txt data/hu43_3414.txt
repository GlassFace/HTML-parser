 The Big 3 Manga (Is is worth it?)
 Hell no, I avoid the Big 3 manga and anime, I watched a few Naruto episodes, got bored with that series fast, then only 1 One Piece, decided there are much better series, and never really got into Bleach. I remember going to the library and checking out and reading Uresei Yatsura manga, it was so fun and weird to read, I'm glad never read Naruto, I would have given up on manga-anime if I had! The Takahashi, Clamp and Peach Pit mangas are wonderful! If you seen the Hayate-I Only got Eyes For You episode where Nagi tells Ruri to avoid certain manga because everyone's read it, that's how I feel too, the most popular series aren't the most interesting series or manga, at least to me, what I'm saying is broaden your horizons and experience many different anime and manga.
