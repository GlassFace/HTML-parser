 Summer 2013 Anime List
 Look's like the summer lineup is here, I see a lot of series I'll be looking forward to, especially Blood Lad since it's getting made into an anime, and it's manga is really good. Anyways, what series are you looking forward to, and why?  Spoiler 
 I can't believe they're giving Ro-Kyuu-Bu another season! Loli ecchi is just wrong (imho)! 

 Can't wait for the Gintama movie. 
 I gotta be honest, non of these anime appeal to me, Ill probably end up watching them, but the only ones I am really interested in are; God only Knows Season 3, Genshiken, and Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaete mo Omaera ga Warui! 

 I am in agreement to sora mainly about the world go only knows, I want want know what the goddess and tenri will sound like. Read the Manga up to the ongoing release part so I should know what it is going to be about. 
  Spoiler 
 I'm interested in FREE, been waiting for that for awhile. I'm really impressed that tumblr willed it into existence pretty much as well. 

 Blood Lad sounds pretty interesting.. Yes! Moar Drama!Kimi no Iru Machi xD who watched the Code Geass: Akito the Exiled? 
 Dubstep Chaos Theory - ShockOne l Siren - Kat Krazy ft Elkka l Faith - BlasterJaxx

 I see a whole lot of bland. Servant x Service might be fun. Teekyuu is actually pretty awesome, I'm looking forward to the second season. Blood Lad at least sounds interesting. Taunki are nifty, so I'll give Uchouten Kazoku a chance. Another Genshiken is something to look forward to, if it's as good as the previous series. Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaete mo Omaera ga Warui! is probably tops on my list. I like that kind of humor.

 nothing in this season particularly sticks out to me. =( Well, looks like its a good time for me to finally catch up to one piece.

 Knowing me, they'll probably ALL end up on my plantowatch list lol, but seriously they just might. Anyways: HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, HIGHSCHOOL DXD NEW, AHAHHFHEWAFGHEAEHGHEAGHEHGGE I CAN'T ****ING WAIT ERMYGAWED AWEGHGEGGAEGJJWG. 
 Rozen Maiden and God Only Knows, those are the animes I am looking forward to...other then that everyone I will give at least one episodes besides second season of shows such as Highschool DxD, I forget why I stopped watching that but probably because of the fan services and no plot line and plus Dakara Boku wa. H ga Dekinai. was airing at the same time as the first season and it turned out to have a plot as well as a decent amount of fan service. Also it seems Rozen Maiden is a reboot of the series so I am happy that I don't need to go and watch all the others before hand, less work for me but at some point I will get around to watching the rest of the series.

 Typical bad summer season. Oh well. Silver Spoon should be good! Same author as Fullmetal Alchemist.

 Now that i'm on mydesktop and have a proper look through them Some that interest me are: - Genshiken Nidaime - Kimi no Iru Machi - Love Lab - Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaete mo Omaera ga Warui! - Kitakubu Katsudou Kiroku - Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyo ^Thats based off pictures and their genre >.> Btw... I don't remember Sora no Otoshimono havn't a second season >.> Unless season 1 and 2 were really short... Also I plan to watch chunibyou some time soon. Havn't seen first season yet.Tales of Symphonia was a ****ing disappointment. I havn't played Tales of Xilia, but just because its Tales of, I will watch it

 monogarti season two OMFGOMFG i watched all the seasons bake nise and neko and going to watch kizu the movie also there's a lot more .... ALSO KILL LA KILL 
 Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide. *Bill The Butcher - Gangs Of New York*

Honestly, you probably shouldn't watch the previous ones, I didn't give the second season a chance seeing as it was original content, but the first season, was...mediocre, I found the latter half of it to be dull compared the insanity and slice of life stuff in the first half. 
 @ShikinamiDesu You can also find me on Hummingbird! 
 Can't wait to watch Blood Lad, also Episode 2 of Code Geass: Akito the Exiled, Season 3 of The World God Only Knows, Season 3 of Sora no Otoshimono . . and hoping for the next season of to love ru . XD .
