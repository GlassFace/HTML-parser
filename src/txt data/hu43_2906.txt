 Seven Deadly sins
 I've read the two first volumes and although that the story seems to be a very stereotyical sh√¥nen and that Elizabeth is as intelligent as my feet, that story is very interesting. Also, the draws are quite like clearer draws of DBZ and Fairy tail put together. People are reading it?
