 Whats Anime like in the UK?
 PEOPLE: Where I live in Somerset Taunton, they don't seem to sell any Anime, (except for DVD copies of the big 3) and no Giblee Films either! When finding legit Anime Fans, I swear to god, I asked people who at least know of Anime's existence or watched Death Note in Youtube, or have at least heard of Crunchyroll, but instead I have "EVERYONE" who just say they are Legit Anime fans, but only watched Death Note or Naruto or only watched Naruto, and say that they will only watch that series. I try to give recommendations, but they don't seem to lack interest, and that there just not bothered; while most of these people are on 5 hours on You Tube or Facebook! They seem to give no absolute poop on Anime as a whole! I even had one person who only watched Black Butler! And she said it was the only show she had ever watched! Showing absolutely no interest in any other Anime what so ever! I had a good friend I meet every Friday and Sunday, but he seems to only been watching Anime for about a year now... And he only watched Gurren Lagann and One Piece and Log Horizon. But after keeping up with One Piece's newest episodes, he stopped watching Log Horizon. And only watched nothing but One Piece. But except for that, he shows no interest in any Anime what so ever, and that he shows no interest to even pirating Full Metal Alchemist, or any great classic that would uplift his spirits into watching Anime in the first place! The style of Anime is more 1000X popular to be used in with GCSE Art Students and teachers alike! It was as if everyone was born with this repellent to avoid the heck out of Anime as much as possible! And keep it to the barest minimum! Q -I HAVE NO LEGIT ANIME FANS I CAN TALK TO IN REAL LIFE, NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY!!! ;_; SO ARE THERE ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS, ON HOW I COULD GET A PERSON INTO ANIME?!-
