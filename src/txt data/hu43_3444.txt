[OOC] Super-Powered
 Mana is a flesh and blood creation made from the genes of super powered beings, so while not being the same as just flesh and blood. I see where you were coming from so I reworked her somewhat. Removed her strength and regen, changed how her speed and reflexes work as well as put limiting factors and conditions on her power which gives her a weakness (tl;dr its energy, she uses lots of it, hint hint.) But I have otherwise discussed in her CS how her ability works, though exact balancing of her ability is something that will most likely need to be played be ear.
