Would've been up yesterday but... my mom made me go see this really, really, dry, boring movie and, well, for some reason it just sucked out every ounce of creativity I had in me. 
 Good post Har! and cannot wait for your post Mya=]! 

 Great post Harlequinn And sorry I am taking forever, I just got home from Mickies, been there for about two nights Monday and Tuesday... I got home from hanging with Neil yesterday and fell asleep right away. Gonna finish my post tonight even if I am working on it past midnight (takes me a while to think) I am slow as hell and I am very sorry :/ BUT It will be up tonight If not then you may bunny but that wont have to happen since it will be .

 Double posting sorry... Okay my post is up now :P. I was only going to post Fallens and work on Namine's later but I figured I should have probably done Namines post as well so that Danny had something to work with . Namines 2'nd half of the part was sort of hurried because I am literally falling asleep at the keyboard so I didn't want to not post tonight. Got it up right before midnight as promised .

 A great post Mya, but the scene at the detention facility. I have a couple questions Wasn't Danny going to have Hucklebee deal with those students? In his last post he has him on his way there, or at least close to it? I'm sure Danny will say it's fine and some how rework his post or future post, but still. Also, that professor, out of curiosity, is it the same one I introduced that put the kids into the detention facility in the first place? 
  Spoiler 
 Oh crap, sorry I forgot.. such horrible memory. I'll change it XD. Oops, hopefully won't happen again. Nah I just brought some random professor but they are going to vanish now.

 Alright, dudes. I'll be starting my post soon. I've been writing a lot of papers for school, and brushing up on my pool game, so I haven't had too much time to sit down and write for fun. I'll try to have something up by the end of next weekend. On another note, I got my septum pierced! 
 We're waiting on Rittz for our side, right Danny? 
 So silent here... Who is next?

 Alright, thank you Harlequinn . Was just getting a tad bit confused. Force said he was going to post as well but I don't know where he vanished off to.

 Hey sorry about not posting. College life attacked me with essays, and tests and stuff. I have half of it written, and I couldn't finish it. I'll try to get it up before I leave to go out for the day. 
 Its fine Force. I understand. I have been busy myself. Good post by the way. I'm contemplating if I should post now, or wait for Rittz and Danny. 
  Spoiler 
 Posted! Sorry if it was a bit later than I imagined, had quite a few things to do... Even on a Sunday ;_; 
​
 Thank you for making my night with those wonderful posts, all. ^_^ Edit: I feel like Danny should go next on our side, right? 
 Eeek!!! I see more posts . Gosh it is always a great feeling to see Glass Academy bold up in the Latest Posts section. Great posts you two .

 [{ Hello, I'd like to join and as you can see, I'm new, but I've done this before! I understand what to do and everything, but I was wondering if it was alright to ask if I may join? This seems like a lot of fun and I have an idea for TeacherX Student if anyone is interested, but if it's too weird, I can make a student too! }] 
 Don't worry Mya, I'm working on my post. And Hii! Thanks for your interest in Glass Academy. And a TeacherxStudent? Hmm Why don't you come up with a cover sheet for your character sheet, and we can review it. 

 SO, how is everyone doing? Are we holding up with college, school, work, whatever is keeping us busy these days? I guess I have not said anything in a while so, here I am. I've been busy, but not too much so. Miss Pepsi seems to have decided not to join after all. Oh well. 
  Spoiler 
 Misspepsie seems to not really enjoy A4 and has disappeared. Hmm, lately I have been busting my butt trying to keep my grades up high in school. Currently I have four A's and one B+ so I guess I am not doing too bad. Other than school, I have been working a lot and trying to squeeze in time for my friends and Neil but it is a tad difficult. All together, I have been pretty decent I guess. How are you, what all have you been doing?

 I am scraping by in my college classes.... Haha 
 I'm trying to fix my grades, work with the club I'm spearheading, prepare for the PSAT, and trying to negotiate.... things with my parents. All in all, I'm pretty busy to say the least. 
 Hey Randoms, liking the new avatar. And hey guys, it's mid term week for me! and don't worry, I'm still working on my post when I can. Yesterday i was in the library for LITERALLY 11 hours yesterday! studying for my midterm I had today, Which I took and was suuper easy lol. I ahve another tomorrow, on Friday, and a paper due on Monday. But hey! after that I should have my post up (or sooner if I have some free time)=]. Seems like we're all busy, I wish everyone good luck! 

 Welp... it is awfully silent in here... -tumbleweed start's hopping by in the wind- .... ehh...
