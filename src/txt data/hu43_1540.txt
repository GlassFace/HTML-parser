[General Discussion] If offered, Would you accept immortality?
 Well, not really immortality. Here's the situation. A mage approaches you and shows you a book. If you sign the cover, you will become immortal. You cannot die, You can regenerate from a single cell to your current appearance. You will not grow old. The ONLY way that you can die is after 900,000 years then yourself will accept death if you somehow grow bored of living. OR you can immediately accept death and you will instantly cease to exist. So what is it?

 I'd take it 100% After 5000 years when I'm bored of everything I will just wish myself dead.

 Yeah, I'd want to experience immortality. To see human advancement to the future and the future itself. but in the end I'll probably get sick of it and be like C.C from Code Geass who in the end wanted to die but couldn't because of her immortality.

 Sure, if I'm able to die at will. It sounds like pretty good deal. I get to live as long as I want, and see and experience as much as I want. Then, the day I don't want to live anymore I just die. 

 Yes, assuming complete healing, but your brain can still improve itself, could mean infinite memory because you would not be able to lose a memory connection. I would like to live for ever because assuming i could not die or be destroyed (unwillingly), it would be interesting to see what would happen to me when the universe undergoes heat death (for those who do not know, essentially every atom is too far apart for them to interact, so absolutely nothing could happen), because i would still be in one piece would i not?

 Sure! That will give me plenty of time to achieve what I want, especially if there is an escape button anytime. It would just be like living now, only ten times longer. Can I get no pain too? Getting hit would still hurt even if one were immortal.

 When there are only those 2 choices then yes. The only issue with immortality is that you will eventually grow bored of living, as everything around you may eventually die, crumble, age etc., but you would not. It would almost be like your body is in suspended animation in a world where everything goes through their natural lifespans except yourself. It may be intriguing and even enjoyable at first but, when friends, relatives etc, begin to die and other such changes, I'd imagine it won't seem so exciting as it first appeared. As for the deal itself, I'd take it. Considering an ultimatum like that was proposed in the "deal", most people would apparently take the obvious choice of living for at least 900,000 years. But I have a question out of curiosity, OP. If you did decide to continue living after that 900,000 years was up, what happens then? Would you have another fixed time limit and still have the option to die, for a 2nd time?

 I'd take it. Only so I can create some crazy cult, go to sleep for 1000 years and when I wake I'd just be a pain in the arse to everyone in the world.

 Yes. My only thing would be I'm not certain i could handle the deaths of all my freinds and family but then again I'd have all of eternity to go mad for a malinea, get bored of that, then rob a liquor store.

 @Arch, After the first 80 years you will stop making frirends and live alone and essentially do everything alone. @Nutts, I think the max is 900000 but you can kill yourself whenever. Also you mean 2000 years right? And cult sounds hatsh... whst about a fishing club?

I'm not creating some religion! Geez. I'm talking about being an annoyance for the generation of that year and annoying them.

 Oh. You mean making up shitty words no.one likes, like swag and yolo? I'd try to learn everything in the world, and when i got bored or tired I'd do scaring pranks on people :3

 Eh, only if the mage will give me a couple of months to get in better shape. But sure, why the hell not. There's so much awesome **** to see and do and eventually I'll pass away thanks to heat death of the universe. It'd be interesting to see how long I'd be able to remember things too; moments from the past and whatnot. How would a human mind and brain adapt to thousands, millions, and billions of years of knowledge and experience? 

 I would accept if you would include the Tardis so No I would not accept his offer if it does not include the time traveling device. e.e

 Yes I would, In a heartbeat. Without remorse, regret or blinking an eye. Its all I want in this life because I do not believe there is one after it. Its all I want and nothing else and the whole growing older and watching people you love die over again is not a problem or loneliness because no one likes me and ladies will never want anything to do with me anyway, Plus I am a mega loner so whatever. Even if I do not get youth with that, science will fix that in time anyway so who cares. I would take the immortality and sacrifice anything in order to gain it no matter what it is end of story period. The end.

 I'd be fun for the first year letting people shoot bullets at you, jumping off mountains but then you'll be itching for a new high but you'll never get it. So f*** no I wouldn't want it. 
 Dang it! We need moar details on the rules of this! But anyhow, I'll gladly take the immortality, just hope when global warming/the end of the world hits in the next 300 years, I go with it. Not trying to be floating around in space, trying for centuries to reach a planet with life on it. I'd lose my mind. ... Dude, that could be a TV show! 
 Lmao. I guess. To see the world in a dull light - watch people die off because of old age or so. I want immortality to escape the true horror and reality of suddenly, dying and having my existence wiped from the physical world. 
 
 I wouldn't. Honestly, it sounds great at the beginning, but when you think about it, it's more of a curse than a gift. When you tire of life, you cannot kill yourself (see where it says you regenerate if even a single cell is left?) If I were an important person, I'd go for it. If I was a scientist, for example. Imagine the advances I could provide for humanity given that length of time. However, when you're just a nobody, it wouldn't be as good. You'd have to forsake pretty much everything that makes you human. Friends, family, even life itself really. You'd lose everything, because you'd be the only constant in the world. All the other people, all the other things, would just become fleeting creatures disappearing before your eyes. I'd rather die right now. 
 To be honest, I don't think I could either. Sure it look's fun and everything: to be able to live forever. After awhile though I think I would be very lonely and the fact I would have to keep it hidden from others. Don't think I could live like that, I rather be close to my family and friends without having that on my shoulders. People would die all around me and I find it extremely hard to say goodbye to people. 
 id take it. there so many places to live in the world that are interesting that you could be moving around all the time. also, planet earth is always changing with technology evolving so rapidly. i dont think i would ever get bored. honestly dont i think i would even want to die after the 900,000 year period 
"I'll say it once more. I am the mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!"
 I would use the opportunity to try Every scheme on the planet. xp Think about it you can go do every crime known to man and even if you get shot or blown up everything is gucci. On the other hand i feel as if that would only be fun for less than half the time. I would also use it to start a revolution. I would use my status as an immortal to become famous. I will openly embrace assassination attempts as they would prove fruitless. all together I would **** **** up leave my mark then leave 900,000,000 
 In all honesty, I would. I'm curious to see where civilized society will be within the next 500 years, if there even is such a thing by then, but not just for that reason. I mean really, take a look at what you could learn with immortality, how much you could experience, and how much you could see. Some people say there is a point where you stop learning and there is nothing else, but I think that life holds endless lessons for us to learn, and I think within Immortality, you could see so many different sites, live many different lives, and try every little thing life has to offer 
 I don't even understand people who say no. Getting old is the worst part of dying. Slowly deteriorating, watching your skin wrinkle away, being unable to do the things you used to do, being in pain, losing memories, looking at pictures of how to used to be and worst of all people treating you like you don't know ****. On top of that you get to watch the people you love die anyway. **** that noise give me forever or let me OD on some gnarly **** before I become old and die. 
 Nice guys are the reason you can't have guy friends. Sowy @Pass_the_M
