 Um, hey
 Hi, My name is Lewis and i'm 19 years old and come from London. I study applied sound engineering at UWL. I am admittedly an anime/forum noob and have only just got into watching anime over the past couple months in between my university degree. I'm a bit of a late bloomer when it comes to anime and have watched very few when I was younger without realising it (card captors, pokemon, DBZ). I wanted to join a forum so I could begin my anime journey and find out new and interesting anime to watch. I have recently seen D. Grey Man, Bleach, Soul Eater and currently watching SAO. I hope people can point me in the right direction so I can enjoy it some more. Oh! and i'm also attending comic con this year at the London Excel centre ^^ 
 Hi lewis, my name is Jay! Nice to see you here at A4, hope you like it here. SAO is what got me back into anime too. I've binged watched many different animes since then. 
 Greetings to you Lewis, and welcome to A4. The good thing is that you have come to the right place if you are interested in learning about and watching many different anime's. Though you don't just have to stop there in some cases the anime has a video game you can play, AND in most cases the anime you like watching has a manga series. As much as I love watching anime, there are times where I find it nice to read a graphic novel. Not to mention that I find that the manga series has more detail to the plot of the story which is why I probably prefer manga to anime. I would have to agree with you on the account of not knowing that you were watching anime till later in life. Which I found that it had opened up a whole new world to me, and didn't make me feel like a loser. To find out that there were other people who love anime just as much as I do, gave me a sense of normal(lived in a hick town). To me it looks like you are well on your way to watching some of the greatest anime's that I know and love. So what do you think is is the best anime genre? Totalchaos

 Hello Lewis! Glad you decided to join here. Trust me you're not alone there, I've recently got back into watching anime again and this place helps you catch up and find a lot of amazing animes! 
 Originally Posted by totalchaosgirl1988 So what do you think is is the best anime genre? Totalchaos I don't think i've watched it enough to get a rounded opinion about a particular genre. But D. Grey Man has been my favourite anime so far. I like the action scenes and the plot. Also last night I read my first manga, due to the D. Grey Man anime only going so far. It was a whole new experience seeing I have never read graphic novels or anime before, going to read some more on the train today.

With you just realizing that you like anime it takes awhile to figure out what kind of genre that is more up your alley. Personally I have found that I can't get into D. Man Grey mostly because of the style that it was drawn in. I just think that it reminded me too much of One Piece which is an anime that I loth right now. Everyone I know that likes anime keeps telling me that it is the greatest. And kudos to you for reading your first manga. I believe that they are great mostly because it really fleshes things out, and makes them last longer. I know that I got really into Fruits Basket from just reading the manga, and once I got and watched the anime I was SO disappointed. I know that I love the mangas more then I like watching the animes. but that is just my preference. Well once you have more anime's that you have watched get back to me so that we can talk more. AND maybe I could recommend a few. but until then watch it, read it, and love it. Totalchaos
