[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 The thing that really got me though... Â Spoiler The internet. How could they believe that the footage aired on a live stream during a large public announcement was doctored, yet they wouldn't question the footage shown of Rukino that was broadcasted from inside a Dorsian building and could have been taken at literally any time before it was aired, with as much time as they wanted to make any kind of modifications they wanted, plus the subject of the video was bound and immobile, so they could do whatever they wanted to her? Ugh, that pissed me off. :/
