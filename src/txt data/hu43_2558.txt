 Anyone have Stephen King's new book?
 ^ if The Drawing of the Three was a tough ride then Wizard and Glass is like walking through the valley of the shadow of death, I'm sorry, that was stupid, but I gave up on Dark Tower during part 4 when I realized nearly 1/3 of the book is back story, King has been known to do this but I couldn't do it at this length. I haven't read anything new from him, I also sadly gave up on 11/23/63 when work became my priority and I had gotten well into it too. Dr. Sleep should be my next in addition to finishing 11/23/63, a shining sequel is a big deal and while were talking about the king. Every novel read up to this point The Stand- 9/10 IT- 9/5/10 Insomnia- 8.5/10 The Dark Half- 8.5/10 Different Seasons- 8.5/10 Misery- 10/10 The Shining- 8/10 Cell- 8/10 Bag of Bones- 9/10 Carrie- 8.5/10 Dark Tower I- 8/10 Dark Tower II- 7.5/10 Dark Tower III- 8.3/10 Duma Key- 8.9/10 Four Past Midnight- 8.5/10 Full Dark No Stars- 8/10 Skeleton Crew- 9/10 On Writing- 9/10 Thinner- 8/10 so yes I do like his work
