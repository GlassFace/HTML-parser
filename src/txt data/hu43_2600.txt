[Comedy] Himegoto (Secret Princess)
 This gag manga is full of traps, lol. xD I didn't even know they were making an anime adaptation of it, but it is airing now! Himegoto follows Hime Arikawa, a second-year student at Shimoshina High School (霜科高校). Forced to assume a large amount of debt from his now-absent parents, Hime is saved by the three girls of his school's student council after he is chased down by debt collectors. In return for paying off his debt, Hime agrees to their conditions of becoming the student council's "dog" and spending his high school life dressed as a girl.

 Ok, do debt collectors seriously go after kids? Hello kayate battle butler.

 Hmmm. Sounds a bit like princess princess. I'll definitely check it out. Thanks Ned. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 This image sums up the first episode (the episodes are 4 minute shorts, btw). And this... :o

 4 minute shorts???? I don't know about that. I didn't exactly like the two part episodes of sakura trick or my wife is a highschool girl. The story development suffers when its not a full twenty minutes in my opinion. Don't get me wrong I liked those shows. I just prefer full shows, not splits. But I'll still give this a shot.

 No need to worry too much about story development on this one. This is purely a gag anime. Just for laughs!

 Oh my ****ing god that was DMX in the intro. Holy ****, that was such a shock, freakin' hilarious. I don't know how to feel for the protagonist...well if this is a gag manga, then he gets no sympathy from me. He exists to serve as the foot of a joke, so...sorry bro, hey maybe you can woo three or four of the Student Council babes and have kinky as hell underage sex with them? 
 Well sounds Like it will be worth a shot then. Thanks Ned and shmuser name. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

I haven't read the manga but I don't think he gets them all to himself for long. From what I've read about it, it sounds like a number more guys get wrangled into cross-dressing for these girls. I saw a pic listing different characters for Himegoto, and they had the male/female symbols next to each one. Every character looked like a bishoujo (beautiful young girl), but only 3 of them (the original student council) had female symbols next to their names. lol! I think there were like 8 or so characters in the entire infopic (including the 3 females). That's why I said in the original post that this manga is full of traps. One of them even had fake breasts (one of the comments explained that, since everybody was going, "No way that's a guy")! I would post the picture if I could find it again, but I didn't pay that much heed to it because this was before I knew it was getting an anime adaptation. xP Originally Posted by Shmuser Name Oh my ****ing god that was DMX in the intro.

 The sub group replaced the OP with a DMX song, it was hilarious. Vid's gone now, but what a laugh.

 ~OH MY GOD the ****ing traps are everywhere! The bulges! The love! I WANT MY KINKY SEX ALREADY ~Yeah! ...I get it it! ...He's a boy but he's a "girl"! ...Think this is getting a bit bland. Just a sliver of predictability. Latest episode: ...Mild comedy here. Uh...I like the animation and voice-acting, still good as always.

Uh...I like the animation and voice-acting, still good as always. I've got to watch this now! It does sound fun! Edit - just watched all 4! It is a fun quirky show. In spirit it is very similar to Princess Princess. But Princess Princess wasn't this slapsticky. I had fun watching it though. That's all that counts right? Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 The reverse rape and domination is so strong here...my heart goes out to you MC. Stay strong...stay different...stay beautiful. 
 I can't believe they said spillage! And it was funny when they said  Spoiler If anything shows we can just use steam or the mysterious beam of light! OK paraphrased the first part but the rest is right... How many shows will there be? They could crank out a few hundred it seems..... Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 Easily one of the best four minute anime in history with Aiura also placing in those rankings. The trap is strong with this one~

Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk I don't think an anime has ever addressed the topic of "spillage" for male testicles before...for a woman's bosom though, well that's a different story.

I thought that was some spoof underground anime the first time I saw it. Its not boku pico is it? Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk Of course Panty and Stocking is a real anime. It was created by "Gainax" and was made to poke fun at anime/US cartoons, but its still really good. Um, no. Why are you throwing out these random titles? Lol.

 Broda didn't throw out a random name, surely a homo-erotic anime such as Boku no Pico has some mention of testicle spillage? 
 Originally Posted by Shmuser Name Broda didn't throw out a random name, surely a homo-erotic anime such as Boku no Pico has some mention of testicle spillage? No, it was random. While Boku no Pico has that material, throwing out titles when not knowing any further information of the anime I'm thinking of is certainly a random guess. Him being wrong twice supports that. Though, I wasn't angry nor was I trying to bring him down and I planning on dropping the subject after the comment.

Wild guesses can still be valid man, shouldn't overrule things because the other half of something was incorrect.

So you admit it was a wild guess? A wild guess = random guess. Vaild or not, you're making this a much bigger problem than it needed to be. All I asked was why he was throwing out random titles when there are so many possibilities what the anime could of been. It seems extremely pointless unless you know more about the anime I'm thinking about and ask more questions. Its like: Me: There was an action anime I really enjoyed back before. Poster: Naruto. Though, it wasn't even a big deal in the first place.
