[Magical Girl] Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei Bu Love!
 This is the story of how five high school boys affiliated with the "Binan High School Earth Defense Club" aka the "Do Nothing Club" are charged by a weird pink wombat creature with protecting the world. In other words.... it's a Magical Boy anime. Enjoy!

 Nope not going to happen 

 ????? Well it might be worth a laugh or two. But I think it would wear thin after awhile. The only magical boy characters aside from harry potter that come to mind are from familiar of zero and Rudy from log horizon.

 might give it a try for the lols 
Understanding 100% of anything is impossible. Thats why we spend all our lives trying to understand the thinking of others. Thats what makes life so interesting. 
 I couldn't sit though the first episode. Started off fine but just got worst and feels like a prodigy of Sailor Moon.

 I don't know about this one..... I'm probably not going to watch it, but i won't judge those who do.

 Then suddenly, one of them reveals himself as a time traveler and-- No more Madoka plot. 
 It is funny for me to see the "magical girl" tag in the title.

 It is very WTF, but things dont need to be serious all the time. Ill keep watching it for now, i have enough braincells to melt.

 Wrong genre classification there. Not "Magical girl" XD

 Feels like one of those "it's so bad it's so good" kind of shows plus the weird taste. Lord Zundar bad guy green porcupine... every time I try to take him seriously, I just end up laughing because he looks and moves funny! And he's small enough to hide in a guy's pocket! XD But it does turn off people who don't like this type of story. Easy to know if you like it or not based on the material. Takes courage to watch. Really. My stomach felt a little weird at first, but it went away after the 2nd episode. Or it could get worse. 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
 Haven't watched any of it yet but it just seems so WRONG! I'm guessing it will either be hilarious or stomach churning.

But finfan - just pretend you are watching Rudy in log horizon or the flashy guy in familiar of zero - the one time nemesis then friend of the mc.
