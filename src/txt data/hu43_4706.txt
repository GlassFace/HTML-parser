[General Discussion] Guys realtalk: The snow attacking New England is insane
 and if you live in Rhode Island it's like asking for a death wish I've always loved snow, but this is slightly overboard. School closures everywhere, and I picked a terrible year for an hour drive commute. It's like every other day I'm asking myself if school will be delayed or closed (my school can't give a warning ahead of time to save their life) then half the time it isn't and I go outside and realize my street hasn't been plowed and I couldn't go anywhere even if I wanted to. 4 weeks into the semester and Monday classes haven't even met yet. Well, here's to hoping the forecast for tomorrow and Thursday are slightly off and we don't get snow.
