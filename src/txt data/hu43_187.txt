 Hello Fellow Anime Fans!!!
 Hello everyone! My name is Monique and I am new to the forum. I'm 25 and I currently reside in Florida. I have a bachelors of science degree in Interactive Media. I love anime, gaming on my 360, graphic design, web design, drawing, watching movies, listening to music, etc. I'm the organizer of the anime meetup group called "Otaku Maniacs" and we meetup twice a month to watch anime and still growing! I've been working on my Tshirt business called "Otsunaaji" because I want that to turn into a brand one day! That's my dream! I hope to chat with fellow anime fans on here!
