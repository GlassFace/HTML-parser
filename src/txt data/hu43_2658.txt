 Bokurano: Ours
 During a summer camp, 15 children; 8 boys and 7 girls, find a grotto by the sea. Deep within they discover working computers and some electronic equipment, and later the owner, a man who introduces himself as Kokopelli. Kokopelli claims to be a programmer working on a brand new game, in which a large robot has to defend the Earth against fifteen alien invasions. He persuades the children to test the game and enter into a contract. Fourteen of them agree, but one of them is kept from entering the contract by her older brother, and a moment later they all mysteriously awaken on the shore, believing what happened was just a dream. Has anyone watched this anime? The show is quite good and is a bit like Neon Genesis Evangalion. Also the twist Â Spoiler
