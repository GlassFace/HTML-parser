[Anime] Anime that makes you think
 My two suggestions have already been made though I don't see Revolutionary Girl Utena or, Mawaru Penguindrum here. Utena is basically completely made up of metaphors people still talk about some of the alternate meanings to it until this day. Then Penguindrum from the same creator is something a little less complex but, still really good. Utena has shoujo ai, shounen ai (barely) and some incest if I remember right just as a warning. Penguindrum has some serious plots that involve incest as well. Don't let this turn you away from these two amazingly unique anime though. At least give them a shot. http://myanimelist.net/anime/440/Shoujo_Kakumei_Utena http://myanimelist.net/anime/10721/Mawaru_Penguindrum Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita - First of all you will NOT find an anime like this. It's sweet and cute and somehow so messed up and psychological. It's truly a treat. I have it on hold because, I want to marathon the rest but, from the first 6 episodes, you will be thinking for sure. http://myanimelist.net/anime/10357/J...tai_Shimashita I will also thumbs up Serial Experiments Lain and second Boogiepop Phantom. Enjoy!
