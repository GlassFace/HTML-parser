 @Yoda313- They will probably do something along those lines I'm sure.

 @Yoda- God that show was so disturbing. I watched a few episodes and not only did the plot freak me out, but so did all the scenes. Anywho I wonder what they are going to do with Kurumi this season? She was a personal favorite from the last.

Anywho I wonder what they are going to do with Kurumi this season? She was a personal favorite from the last. If they did follow the novel, then Kurumi won't have any major role in this season, and would only appear in the latter half of this season, presumably episode 6 onwards. This season is more biased towards dark tohka, so it's kind of predictable. Such a waste for such a fine material. But the Yamai Sisters and Miku are not half bad either. And Tohka is still on top of my list.

 Is kurumi the one with the clock eyes???? Yeah tohka is still number one in my book Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 Yeah Kurumi has the clock eye. I thought she was a cool character, more than slightly demented, but still a cool character.

 Wow the newest one is great too.  Spoiler wow who would think Kotori Itsuka would have to maybe kill shido??? I just love these full-on self sacrificing characters like shido who want to save everyone regardless of their own safety Edit - Yes I had to use wiki to remember shido's sisters name.... I'm horrible with names remember? 
 Episode was rather intense. I liked the twist with him being able to summon sandalphon even though it wasn't surprising at all.

 I was surprised! Really. I like super-shido even more now. 
 They foreshadowed it with all of the different events that took place where he was powerless, but desired to protect them. Also he was absorbing the powers of all the spirits. The big surprise for me will be if he actually is able to use the powers of the other spirits as well or if they are just gonna stick with Tohka.

 Remember why he can regenerate from death? It was his sister's power, which he sealed... Naturally he should be able to use Tohka's power. But what really makes me happy is seeing a Kurumi flashback. I'm gonna miss her all season! T_T And we need to see more Yoshino and Yoshinon, not just watching TV!

 That's a good point, I guess I just didn't think of it because it's more of a dormant/passive ability. Also I agree with you on that Yoshino should be in the light a bit more.

 @ karnage and ned - all the more reason we need a season 3 right? 
 @Yoda: The show as potential, but it's not really meeting it (In my opinion at least). I still like the show, I just feel they could do so much more.

 If anyone went into a show about making spiritual beings fall in love with you to be of super quality should never have walked through the door haha. The first season done well at being mindless yet still containing a plot to tie us down with. It was a great show of action/romance and general character development. Season 2 has obviously gone for a darker route but still seems to be as mindless as ever and I expected that, if I wanted to watch a realistic show it wouldn't be this. This show is my Friday night chill and have a laugh and fist pump the air.

 Don't get me wrong I'm not looking for a major plot show, it's just something that I noticed is all. I enjoy the light atmosphere of the show. doesn't take much to focus in on it and have an enjoyable time watching.

 I just fear that this show has turned into a slightly better version of Infinite Stratos, which isn't saying much. If they can just cool down on the cliches for a bit this anime can be really good. I really like how complicated many of the characters are and how they are trying not to make this just a straight harem with a guy who is as dense as a planet. With that said Yuzuru is the best, but only by a small amount over Thoka and Tobiichi 
 2nd season I thought started out okay and with potential, but I just can't do it anymore. When I'm watching the more recent episodes I'm just saying to myself "I could be watching hentai and get the exact same result as watching this". Ecchi can be tossed around for laughs here and there (or whatever you want to use it for really), but if you just use it because you can; you get a horrible result.

Ecchi butchers most shows from ever fulfilling any kind of potential :/

Yes, too many ecchi could ruin a show, but I still find this show enjoyable so far, though this is not what I would call amazing. Well, kind of like a refreshment for fun's sake.
