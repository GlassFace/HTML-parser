 Dragon Age: Inquisition
 So, after playing the first area in the game I think I can safely say it's going to take ****ing ages to complete the game. The levels are enormous and jam-packed with things to do, from securing camps for your troops (that you can use to fast travel with) to completing quests to searching for resources for your inquisition to do its thing -- I played for about 5 hours total before I felt like I could move on to the next task and I didn't even do everything I could have. I still only have members of the original party and I've barely done anything where the overarching story is concerned but I still feel like I got a lot done. Part of what impresses me so much is the tech running this monster. The levels are enormous. I remembering wondering why they were offering mounts to people who purchase the special edition and now I understand why. I'm pretty biased here but I'm pretty confident this will be a contender for game of the year and hands down the best RPG of the year.
