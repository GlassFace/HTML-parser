 What are your top five favorite games
 1- Super Mario 64: Shigeru Miyamoto and the staff by his side were ******* geniuses with this gem. I just recently beat it a few months ago and it holds up so greatly again and will continue to do so. 3d Mario is common now but back then this was a new venue, untraveled land and they made it work and then they made it awesome for the ages. Now in no order below. Grand Theft Auto Vice City- driving down the side of Miami beaches at sunsets in a slick car and listening to Tears for Fears has became a real life fantasy for me, if I won the lottery last night that'd be the first thing I do... maybe that's why I didn't win, ha ha. Tony Hawk's Underground- the first moment where I got off my board and walked was like the caveman's discovery of fire, what a simple thing I wanted from the other games and now I have it... and walking is the greatest thing now. It also resonated with that thug life I kind dug at the time, you know... middle school years. Super Mario Bros 3- no words needed Sim Tower
