[Anime] What Anime should I start friend with
 Hi I need some help getting my friend in to anime but I don't know what to start him in. If anyone could suggest any short-term animes to me to start him on that would be great . My friend usually likes sci fi and criminal law tv shows like Stargate or CSI so I was hoping to get him started from something in those genres. Thank You in advance. 
 I would seriously advise against starting someone off with scifi anime, if they are used to watching epic scifi live action series, because sadly the anime lacks scifi based series that could even hold a candle to such. The Mystery genre on the other hand is a bit better off, but the problem with that is, most of them are only subbed(which Isn't good to start new comers on). In short those are pretty bad genres to use to get people into anime, but if your friend is use to watching subbed movies or something(aka he's into old imported martial arts movies, wuxia series, ect), I would give Detective Academy Q a shot(45 ep).

 Well something Stargate related I would say Kakumeiki Valvrave. I really liked that one. and a CSI one maybe cowboy bebop? criminal law animes arent my forte but definitely check those out

 He's never seen any subbed shows before thats something I forgot to add in. He probably won't like it either because he's the type that hates reading. So if you got any that are dubbed I will highly appreciate it.

There's just one problem, how is the OP's friend or anyone else not living in Japan gonna beable to watch this, It's literally brand new? Was it uploaded to Crunchyroll or something? To OP: If you don't know, Crunchyroll is a legal streaming site(all anime uploaded to it is the Japanese subbed versions) that is used as a bandaid for the anime that aren't released outside of Japan. Edit: Oh, ok, then you're gonna have a hard time finding anything in the Mystery genre as well sigh, would he be big into any other genres, Dramas, action adventure, comedy, slice of life, tourney fighters, ects? Actually come to think of it, there is a pretty awesome scifi anime, but It's only a movie. However your friend should like it, and it is dubbed in English. It's called Ark(It's a Korean anime). Here's the Wikipedia page for it: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?...ecial%3ASearch It's the first one on the list, Ark(2005 film)

 If he's into sci-fi, and may not be into subbed shows quite yet, start him off in the shallow end of the pool with things like Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star, Trigun, and perhaps a more accessible and short Gundam series like 08th MS Team. The heavy Western influences of the former three make them some of the more accessible anime series out there, as far as science fiction goes, as well as anime in general. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

Watch It!!! Or I'll Take Your Soul 
 based off what he likes id say death note and monster.but thats a.long.one. 
Anime watched: 73 My Youtube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/Uatemydoodle Kpop Thread: http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...4-K-pop-Anyone 
 In addition to the above, you could recommend Gun x Sword, really fun sorta sci-fi western thing. 

 Thank you everyone! I will look at each anime and see what's the best for him. Then I will reply on which I pick and if my friend likes it 
 For sci-fi might I add Fractale and Sword Art Online. I'm pretty sure he'll enjoy Fractale if he isn't confused easily but I don't know about SAO. And as for mystery show him Death Note. 
 So many books, so little time.
 Guilty Crown and Code Geass come to mind. Those two are great, action-packed series consisting of 25 (or 26) episodes. Also, you might want to consider introducing Steins;Gate o 3o;; I heard that was a good Sci-Fi/Mystery anime tinged with romance Gundam, on the other hand, felt like a drag for me >n< But it's mecha & sci-fi. 
 
 If its for a nub and you want them to have a really good first experience, rather than a short series i say start them on the Anime movie REDLINE, it is sifi, it is not overly complex (at all), animation is very very pretty and it is loaded with action. It will impress anyone but get them to realize it is a movie with a huge budget so it does not set the bar really high for a series. As for a short series i recommend Full Metal Panic and Gundam SeeD (not Destiny, careful) (Gundam SeeD is 50 epsiodes so maybe too long) 
Sand Cats are Bloody Adorable. 
 I'd have to agree with Cowboy Beebop series for several reasons. It's a very well rounded anime, it has action, drama, mystery, crime, comedy. It's set in a sci-fi universe, in the future, outerspace travel, multiple worlds, but it's main focus is the collection of very relatable stories. They are tightly written around the characters, and well paced. The characters are well written. The artwork and music is pretty solid. It's a good intro to anime. The movies Akira and Ghost In The Shell are big budget movies, that have spectacular visual/audio impact, but unfortunately they suffer what many anime movies suffer, there are big chunks of rather boring scenes that are important to explaining the backdrop and environment of the story, the "world of" type of scenes, punctuated by stunning action sequences. The have fewer key characters and the focus is on rather extraordinary events surrounding a very far out story. So if your friend lacks the attention span... 
 Blue drop is a good one to start with

 start with someone interesting and has action. dont go with something that he needs to try really hard to pay attention. try FMA: Brotherhood or attack on titan. These shows can suck you in quick and are addicting.

 Death Note is for sure a great first anime 
​
 I got started of by a friend advising me to watch Death Note and that got me hooked to anime so I would definatly start there 
 Blue gender is another good one to start with or if you like csi you might like a.d. police and angel cop

 He might enjoy Death Note, it's quite a long anime though. 

 First off, don't do what the poster did in the thread titled Watching anime with friend for the first time. Second, hang out with your friend a couple times and actively observe. That means, analyze him/her without being annoying or obvious about it to get a feel for thier interests outside of mainstream scifi. Listen for key statements that reveal an intrigue or get a glance of the reaction during a regular tv show or even commercial. When introducing someone to a huge realm known as Japanese Animation, you have to know your audience better than the executives at NBC during primetime. It's not like, "hey, wanna check out the new Phineas and Ferb?" (Clearly, an extreme.) Some anime can be as simple as that, but I'm assuming that you are both older individuals who have a bigger IQ than those that watch Disney XD. I would advise not starting with "mainstream" shows like Naruto. It can come across as cheesy to the anime noob and it's huge episode list will turn them off to continue watching. (It's like the Hot Topic of anime anyways). Look around sites like THEM anime reviews or Anime News Network for some ideas. You also have this forum to ask once you know for sure what your friend would watch if it wasn't sci-fi.
