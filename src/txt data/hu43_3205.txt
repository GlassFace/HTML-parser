[Personal Life Discussions] One or more things that drive you crazy about the opposite gender?
 It really grates me when women beat around the bush on an issue or imply it and expect you to know what it is just from what minor hints they may put out there. I am not a mind reader and even if I was, I don't think you would like it. Then again, I have been guilty of this myself so I cannot be too hard on it.

 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
