 Favorite Mystery Anime?
 GoSick is hands down my favorite mystery anime. It had a consistent story and plot with incorporated romance that wasn't forced at all. The mystery's and the way they were solved were the most interesting part of this anime and how they went about taking care of each one. I've also noticed that a lot of people overlooked this anime, but if you're into mystery this is a must in my opinion.
