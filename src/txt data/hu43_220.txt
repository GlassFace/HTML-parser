 Assassins Creed Brotherhood
 It's almost time for one of my all time favorite game series Assassin's creed to come back with another chapter or should I say sequel to assassin's creed 2. I'm mostly excited for the multiplayer. I heard about the beta download thing, but I really don't understand the hold concept.
