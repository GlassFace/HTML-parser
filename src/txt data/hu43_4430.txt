 RIP Monty Oum
 This is intensely sad. I just logged on to see if there was a thread for him. RWBY and RvB is not even my cup of tea but I remember seeing Haloid and Dead Fantasy and being shocked! It was utterly amazing what this guy rigged together with quick cuts and really smooth and fast animation. I didn't even know he created these until last night. When everyone told Monty that makign RWBY would be impossible or "too hard" he went and made it. Even if the tweening and animation wasn't that good (imo) for season 1 and 2 he still went on to create more and make it better. His passion and work ethic are so admirable. Not only that he inspired a lot of people I look up to creatively and seems to have effected a bunch of people all over he even has a time.com article (rightfully so). RIP Monty.
