[Anime] Do you watch more than one series at a time or do you finish one first than move on?
 Ok I'm still not sure where to post general anime discussions so here we go. Do you finish an anime series all the way the through before starting another one? Or do you watch more than one at a time (I mean one show in one series and then go to another show in another series, not literally at the same time - I guess you knew what I meant but just wanted to be sure). I always finish a series first before moving on to something else. Only exception might be for a movie or an ova of a series. Something thats relatively short in duration so as not to take me away too much from what I was already involved in. How about you? ---------------------------------------------- If this needs to be moved somewhere else please let me know. As I said I'm not sure where to post general anime discussions. 
 Eh... it varies sometimes. Usually when I watch more than one series at a time I watch a long-running series and a short 12-24 episode series as well. But other than that I usually watch one short series at a time and move on to the next series.

 I usually watch shows on Hulu or Crunchyroll, so if I'm watching a current show where you only get to see one new ep a week then yeah, I'll find another show to fill in the time. If the whole season is already available, then I'll watch it to the end. 

 Well I've got a kindel and a tv so right now I'm watching blue exorcist on the kindel and birds of prey on the tv but usually i stick to the kindel. I don't really watch tv

Occasionally I engage myself with a short ova in between.

 gRIFFMEISTER has a point. I didn't distinguish between current shows. I've had so much backlog that I haven't even thought of tackling a current run show. That would be an ok exception (in my book - obviously if you jump from series to series there is nothing wrong with that, I just don't do it) since the series isn't complete. Or at least put it this way the season wasn't complete. I take it back only exception to that was freezing vibration. When I found out there was a continuation to Freezing I wanted to check out Vibration. But i waited for the series to be out first so it was done before I started it (which I did finish and liked it for the most part). But otherwise no I haven't done current run shows. edit - and tigeris does have a good point to - If its some 50 episode monster I might break that up into seasons. I'd do whatever constitutes a season - be it 12 or 15 episodes or so - and then take a break and come back to it later. The longest series I've tackeled in a row in the last few months was the four part Zero no series (the one that was like harry potter, forgot the last part of the show name) 
 Well whenever i get to watch a really good show, i can't help myself and have to watch at least like 5-6 episodes a day of it. I kill the suspense of it, so to speak, but what can I do when it's so goddamn interesting. Mostly, i would watch simultaneously a couple of shows, 1-2 episodes per day but then i gets harder to go "in it", to blend with the story and the characters themselves. So, if im watching a couple of shows simulatenously, that means I'm really not into them so much. So, to wrap it up, it's a really tough decision :-) 
 I usually watch one tv-show and move to the next one once I finished it, hovewer when it comes to movies and OVAs I don't really care and watch even when I'm in the middle of the tv-show.

But what about ones that are linear and follow after a series? Doesn't that kind of ruin the series for you a bit? I know some ovas are standalone jobs and others are meant to be prequels to another season. But I would think seeing stuff that hasn't happened yet in the series might detract from the overall experience.... 
 If it's a completed series then I will finish it before finding another fully released series. If it's a current airing show I will watch as many as I feel like. I think I'm keeping up with 12 series at the moment.

I watch those that fit inside the storyline of a series when I'm at that point in the story, those that I watch in the middle of another show are the standalone ones. 
 One at a time if the series is complete. 12 episodes can be finished in a day. If they are ongoing, then there is really no choice but to watch them all as they come out.

 It varies a lot for me. Each season, I'll normally follow along with 2-3 shows, but if there's a complete series that I'm marathoning I'll just watch that until complete. I actually have a brother who watches only the first and last episodes of most series, which is probably the weirdest I've ever seen.

My sister does the same thing, and if she likes what she see, then she will pick up the series. Although, it runs in the family that we can pretty much get the gist of the story from just the beginning and end.

 When I used to follow anime closely, I only watched 1 series at a time. I still keep on hand a couple of titles, and still have the same habits.

 it depends on the plot and story to me and action, like i was watching multiple series at one time but it was one that caught and kept my attention more then the others like a fell off of bleach hard now i'm getting back into along with one piece and many others. 

 Personally, if I find more than one anime I like whenever they begin a new series of airing, I'll watch them all as they come out. If I find a complete series that I hadn't thought I'd like, I try to watch it all. Sometimes, I get burned out on something if I have more than 15 or so episodes to watch, so I'll watch something else for a while before getting back to the other. 
 I finish any series which are <=26 episodes in one day, longer series I finish over the course of 2-4 days Now, backburner series occur due to a series more interesting than the one I am currently watching happening along, no more & no less. 
 I watch about 3-5 at a time. I can't start too many or I lose track.

 I never "binge view" long running shows so I usually have a 2-4 show rotation. Especially when rental stores were still around.

This always struck me as a really random way to pick shows, so it's interesting to see other people doing it. I guess if you spend enough time on the net looking for stuff, you get creative ways of figuring out what you like.

 I used to give everything that I thought looked interesting a shot at the beginning of a new season. But with my work schedule being so hectic I haven't had much time to keep on anything I do find interesting. I started Log Horizon which I was enjoying got about 10 episodes in and haven't had time to continue. I also was watching Space Dandy as it was airing but haven't seen an episode since the third one now. So as of this point no I do not watch more than one series at the same time but when I have the time I normally do watch multiple series simultaneously. 
 
 It varies for me. If it's currently airing, then no, I don't wait til it's finished because it's like 30 minutes per week. If it's something older that I picked up, then I'll finish it before starting something else. I don't watch a lot of TV nowadays anyway, but when I do, that's usually how I tend to go about it.

 For me, it depends but I usually watch 2-3 simultaneously. One is a very long show (26+ eps) while the remaining 1-2 are short shows (26- eps). For example, I'm watching Fairy Tale, SAO, and looking for a short comedy series.
