 Hahahaha! His enthusiasm makes me laugh. Yoda, you sillygoose. I changed my nomination now only to make it fair since I think he deserves one as well. Number of nominations does not matter. It's the polls that matter in the end.

I know I am not conniving lmao, I just don't get on here much and you and him are the only two I can think of, I thought you'd be more playful about it but guess not. I don't have the time to be a conniving wench, I hardly have time to play the role of villain I so deserve lmao. Wuv you Fae, stay beautiful <3 don't turn the other way <3 
 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses. Beside you as you like softly down, I will be until I hear the words "Checkmate". ~Sebastian Michaelis ~ Individual 4 ~ A4's Greatest Villain <Right Here Lmao

I don't have the time to be a conniving wench, I hardly have time to play the role of villain I so deserve lmao. Wuv you Fae, stay beautiful <3 don't turn the other way <3 Nessa, I've barely been around the forums the entire year and the elevens or you. And from what I discussed within the Elevens with last years events, I'm pretty sure I should have been the LAST person on your mind for this nomination with how I felt about it. You were probably just nominating people you knew, but given last year? It is not something, I myself, can laugh at; and probably unfair because there are accurate people for this one. Lol. This year I am less deserving of any nomination. So, please excuse me for feeling like this was slightly an attack on me because I've not been closely apart of the Elevens for quite awhile now and am aware of things that have been said. Wench btw is actually pretty toned down coming from me and isn't a literal insult. I call my Boston Terrier a wench because a b*tch is too accurate for a female dog (lol), it's also in playful nature. -shrug- Sorry to derail this a bit. Any further remarks, feel free to send something to me~

 Guys, it's a nominations thread. Who cares. The nominations will be reviewed during this week and we will be setting up the polls. It won't be like last year. Lifting Veils is sort of a silly award anyway, as is the spammer award. I don't think anyone will be too upset about those. :P
