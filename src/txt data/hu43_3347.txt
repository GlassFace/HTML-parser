 Hey everyone, I'm Revenant :).
 Hello everyone and fellow Otaku, I'm Revenant or you may call me Nick. Whichever suits you better , I'd just like to take this time to get my first post out there and talk a little about myself and so on c:. Okay, so.. Let's just jump right in, I'm from Canada which it's cold as hell here x,x.. I'm really interested in Photoshop as I make my own Signatures and of course signatures for other people. I've been trying to branch out from doing Signature's but I actually have no idea what to do other than Signatures X3... Enough about PS, anyway I'm a huge Otaku, I just love killing time by either watching something new or rewatching an old favourite and as of right now my favourite is Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works. I love it when people recommend anime to me as it'll either give me something to rewatch or something entirely new to really enjoy, like as of last week I finished Tokyo Ghoul and it was pretty amazing. So, other interests I have are drawing, listening to music and just relaxing really. I don't want to bore you and make this post extremely long haha, so I just want to say thanks for the welcomes in advance and I look forward to making some pretty great friends on here . 
 Signature here was made by me , if you'd like one let me know!
