 Hi i'm Dagoir, I joined this forum to know more about some anime's and people opinions about them. I also joined to open up myself to finding new anime's that i haven't watched yet. I respect everyone's opinion on topics, i'm always up to explore new styles/genres in anime that i might have avoided previously. Anyway thank you for having me and hopefully we will meet again. Friendly Greetings from Dagoir.
