[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Originally Posted by Ian the Korean I have trouble telling if it's good or not honestly, but I think it's very entertaining. A lot of it seems to be Bandai and Sunrise having some fun with the usual mecha tropes. Like, wildcards keep getting thrown in on a regular basis every episode, but it's written well enough that it doesn't feel like it's ever actually jumped the shark. The story itself has gotten a lot more defined, although quite a bit darker as well. The main character, Haruto, hasn't changed a whole lot fundamentally, but he definitely gets stronger as it's progressed. Overall I like it a lot, definitely one of the best shows this season. I'd say watch episode 2 and/or 3 and if it doesn't grab you by then it's probably just not the show for you. It mostly hasn't taken itself too seriously and I think some people may have gotten the wrong impression about it with the way it started. Because of that I think you might have trouble finding a reviewer who is going to be able to give you the sort of analysis you're looking for; how any given person interprets the show is going to strongly rely on how much mecha they've watched, especially stuff like Code Geass or Gundam SEED and similiar. Either way, I was expecting a reply from you and I figured you'll give me the best understanding of the show up to now. And considering the first episode and what's been said and what I've read up to now in this thread, I won't be picking it up again. I don't want to force myself to watch something like I did with future diary which I regret to this day due to how bad it was. Plus I don't see mechs as a good story element, they are there to help those that control them like any show about humans controlling something...I could word this better I'm just not with it today. Anyway the comparison is with a show like Girls Und Panzer which I loved. Anyway thanks for the help Ian and making this simple.
