 Most introductory title imaginable
 *waves* After a long while of waiting to be able to post (something went weird with my registration so I had to wait for some really kind people to help me out) I finally got unlocked, which means that I shall introduce myself here! What you all basically should know is: - My name is Yuki but you can also call me Kami if you like, whatever you prefer - I'm generally friendly so I don't think I'd have troubles with getting along with people - I really like making new friends so I hope I can meet others with a similar/equal mentality :3 - ATM (more or less soon-ish-y-esque) I'm 16 years old - MtF transgender (thought that telling that ASAP is better than not at all (happened once and the outcome was beyond uncomfortable)) - Likes many things (including anime and everything related, though unfortunately I don't have much time to focus on it) - My quirky behaviour might be explained by the fact that I was diagnosed with ADD, Aspergers and other things (ugh) -I'm here to meet new people and stuff Which means I'm here now world!
