[Fantasy] Junketsu no Maria (Maria the Virgin Witch / Sorcière de gré, pucelle de force)
 Maria the Virgin Witch (Japanese: 純潔のマリア Hepburn: Junketsu no Maria, subtitled Sorcière de gré, pucelle de force) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masayuki Ishikawa. Kodansha Comics USA licensed the manga and will released it in 2015. It will be adapted into an anime for the Winter 2015 season starting in January. Set in France during the Hundred Years' War, it follows Maria, who is one of the most powerful witches of her era. She intervenes against the warring nations by using her succubus and incubus familiars to manipulate the opposing factions, as well as large-scale illusions, all for the sake of helping the people and maintaining peace. As a result, she has gained the appreciation of several villagers and the hostility of the Church, which considers her a heretic. Yet Maria is still a virgin and her own familiars tease her about it. As news of her actions spreads, Archangel Michael focuses on Maria and rejects her interference in human affairs. After a direct confrontation, Michael ultimately decides that Maria will lose her magical powers if she loses her virginity and also forbids her from publicly using magic, sending an angel called Ezekiel to oversee this decree.

 Oh, okay! lol.

 I mean, this already looks a bit silly with the talk of succubi and incubi and virginities...but I;ll have a gander because I seem to sense a vanilla romance with Ezekiel and Maria. 
 Haha. This is the ecchi of the season right.

 YES! This one just aired today! Can't wait to watch it! 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 **** yeah. I am pretty excited to see the pilot. 
 Woah ho, that Succubus used her jaw too much?! Oh my... Well, I hope Joseph and Anne don't get harmed. Garfa seems okay. What is this coalition of young, beautiful witches, it's great. Ha, that archer got ****ed up. What is Maria doin- OH MY GOD IS THAT A DRAGON?! Yeah, the Roman Catholics were very radical back then. Maria is straight up gunning at them for their terrible mistreatment of certain people, like Joan of Arc. If she's going to go a rant regarding social commentary, at least the music could have been a bit more serious instead of playful. Maria, what the **** are you saying? To a dog? Really?! This was a nice episode. A lot of things were happening right after the other though, I do think pacing could have been a teensy bit better. Also that ending, with Joan of Arc and Maria admitting her dislike for the Roman Catholic Church because they're a bunch of creepy old men...um, that sort of came out of nowhere. I really hate the thought of creepy old men doing anything terrible to both sexes. 
 I'm really behind on things so this doesn't say much, but so far Maria is right at the top of my list this season along with the new season continuations of previous series (ie, like Tokyo Ghoul, JoJo, Parasyte, etc.)

 I get a really strong spice and wolf vibe here. Maybe its just because its set in a ye olde time period. I do like this a lot. I kinda wish the battle was a little longer. This looks to be a very entertain show

 The week and a half wait for the next episode was killing me! I guess that's the problem with having an early-released pilot... But damn, I said before this was topping my list for the season, but now after the second episode it's definitely solidified its place on top! On top... like Artemis's favorite position. xD 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 Watched the first ep. She's really a cute tsun tsun. But I hope the story is a solid one....

 I am really getting into this one I love the artwork. The animation is so fluid and realistic - but it still has the fun toon look. I must admit though I dont know the Bible stories very well so this will be kind of lost on me. But I'm really looking forward to more of this show.

 I can only guess she referred to JeaN D'Arc near the end there? And witches were hunted and burned in age of enlightenment. Not sure about bible stuffs at all

 I was raised in the Christian church and was even an ordained minister when I lived in Texas. I could quote Gospel straight out of my head. I am now a Pagan and a witch. I used to practice the Old Religion (Italian witchcraft from the 19th century) but have now expanded to modern witchcraft (known as Wicca, and formed in the 1960's)... because sometimes the old ways are just too dated. My gospel is now Aradia, the gospel of witches. So yeah, I can totally relate to everything in here. On the church side, they are totally over-the-top and melodramatic about it, though there is basis in the truth. On the witchcraft side there is even less realism, but the themes are cool. The persecution is real - that struggle is true. People seek the help of witches, then shun them immediately. Even today you can see how people will ask witches to divine their secrets, then will carry on with fear mongering of the same people they sought advice from. In case you're wondering, witchcraft is a nature-based religion which believes that nature is the Great Teacher. We learn the workings of the heavens by studying the workings of nature which was made by the same creative force. Pagan folk religion is basically what is now labeled as "witchcraft". If you've ever noticed the distinct differences between the Catholic church and the general "Christian" denominations, a great deal of that comes from the merging of Pagan folk religion into the early Catholic church in order to overtake it and create one state-sanctioned religion. It was all about politics, not religion. Have you ever wondered why Catholics worship the Saints, as various aspects of godhood? This is a Pagan idea. Why do Catholics celebrate Christmas in the middle of winter when all historians agree that Christ was not born then? In order to coincide with the Pagan yule season. Why is the Catholic sabbath on Sunday, when the Jewish sabbath observed in the Bible was always on Saturday? Because of the Roman tradition of Mithraic sun-worship. Why is the number 13 unlucky? Because that number has a long history in Pagan folklore as a lucky number. I could go on.

 Wow thanks Ned. However I thought thirteen was unlucky because of the Templar purge on a day on the 13th in the middle ages???

That would be "Black Friday", which we now refer to as "Friday the 13th". Friday, October 13th of the year 1307 is when all the Templars in France were rounded up and imprisoned (then charged with "satanism"). That date was probably not coincidental, as the superstition of the number 13 predates it, and remember who chose that date to perform the roundup. But this is the direct explanation behind our "Friday the 13th" superstition.

 Thanks for the clarification Ned

 No problema.

 For some reason the photo reminded me of kill la kill and then after hearing junketsu I'd say this is a must watch 

 Ned revealed more of his personal life. Success, everyone! Thank you for the knowledge drop. I find it funny how Artemis, the Virgin Goddess of the Hunt, is the name of a slutty Succubus. These damn priests are doing the blind worship to the "will of God" thing really well, and it's annoying! That homosexual scene was a jarring surprise to me. Maria conjured herself up a Shota. Oh dude, that type of pseudo-rape comedy is just wrong. Now the village is also getting attacked by more rapists. The agents of the Heavens (Michale being the most notable in this episode) are really harsh. I wish they showed at least some humanity or regret in enforcing these "natural order" laws of the world. I'm rooting for you Maria! Incubus Shota and Succubus Babe are a tag-team of kinky destruction. Maria is a boss who has a good heart. Joseph and Ann keep her grounded in reality and humanity. This cast of characters are great.

 This show does the entire Medieval setting so well. From the homosexuality and hypocrisy of the Church, to the violence and supernatural.
