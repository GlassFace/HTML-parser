[Personal Life Discussions] What do you think about Online Dating?
 To my opinion online dating and close proximity dating is all the same to me depending on the persons and how they see it, but the way I see it is Online dating is the same issue is some people don't treat it that way. All in all love is love if you choose it to be true love online or not you have to choose whether or not to treat it like a real relationship, but long distance just makes the first time meeting all the more sweeter now that's not to say that all guys/ girls are right for you it's the same as being in a real one. So just know what you're getting into and know the other persons feelings and if that person becomes abusive obviously not the right person and should be avoided at all costs, but using dating sites meant to hook you up with someone not the right reason to be in a relationship I believe it should just happen.
