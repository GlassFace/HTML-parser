 What are you currently Playing?
 About to finish the latest chapter in Telltales Game of Thrones. Just about to start American mcgee's Alice and alice: madness returns. Have played the second and always wanted to play the first, but never got to. So am glad it's download able for free with madness returns. Remember some of the platform/jumping controls to be a little clunky, but did enot the atmosphere and story.
