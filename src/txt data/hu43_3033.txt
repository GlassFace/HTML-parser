 Feminist games critic cancels talk after terror threat
 RIP gamers . I cri evertim... In other news, the gamer of the year is YOU! http://i.imgur.com/1sMMf6B.png Kotaku: where you can find recycled Time articles written at an 8th grade level. And also backpedaling so hilarious that I think poop gushed out I laughed so hard. edit: Gamergate has been an enormous success this year! In its short history, it's already cost Gawker seven figures in advertising revenue. Nick Denton has stepped down as president as well. Several gaming journalist outlets have updated their policies, although they still insist on lying about what GG is. SJWs have tried multiple times to shut down the movement with lies/misinformation campaigns, but they've crumbled one by one. Hoping that GG keeps going strong in 2015!
