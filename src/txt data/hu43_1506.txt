 Check Out My Drawings!
 Hey guys, I just wanted you to check out some of my drawings I have been drawing for a while, but never really practiced a lot, it just comes and goes, so don't criticize to much unless it's something u think would really help me! Well enjoy! http://s744.photobucket.com/user/Run...tml?sort=3&o=0 those aren't all of em, but those are probably my best

 Not that bad if you haven't been drawing long. I'm pretty good at stick figures myself (; Hope to see more when you improve. 

 Better than me One thing though. Arms can't bend like that :s

 I like that bottom left one I guess my only advice would be to try and use lineless paper whenever you can. 
 I like these, they're cute and each character has their own style/personality to them ^3^ if you have time feel free to check some of mine out x3 Edit: forgot to post link :$ http://czomb.deviantart.com/

 I haven't drawn in a long time and shading, clothing, and complicated details are my main weaknesses.

 I really like these :] (cute stuff) if you are putting effort into learning more now you should watch Mark Crilley on youtube, he puts up some really good stuff, his vids helped me with clothing and hands (horrible horrible hands)
