 Vegeta vs Hulk!
 Except the single use of the kili measurement did not determine anything outside of stating what Yakon and Goku's power levels were in that form of measurement. The only times a number is given to planet-destroying power requirements is in the anime (non-canon), and by a Daizenshuu (non-canon). Non-canon material doesn't determine the canon. This continues to be entirely beside the point. Were he capable (he's not), Vegeta could destroy all the planets he likes. The fact remains that it simply wouldn't matter. Hulk would survive. Vegeta could turn the entire planet to dust, and he'd only be killing himself. Debating whether or not Vegeta could destroy a planet based on evidence of his power is pointless, as Frieza did do it, and clearly he would be no match for Hulk. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
