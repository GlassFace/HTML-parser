 A post apocalyptic Mecha series or movie?
 Looking for one that has doom and gloom destroyed world like that matt damon movie only with mechs. I've seen Blue Gender. what else is there? I always thought It would be rad to see a mecha that get's build in a junk yard environment to fight off a suppressive regime.Suggestions?
