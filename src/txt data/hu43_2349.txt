 Diablo 3 and reaper of souls
 So i recently started playing D3 and was just curious on what this community has to say about is maybe party together?...classes..... levels..... who getting the reaper of souls expansion? i wanna quest guys =P 
 Leveled up one of each class to 60 and cleared Inferno with them all when it first came out, but got incredibly bored due to the focus of the AH/RMAH and the impossibility of progressing my gear through simply playing. So I pretty much put it down for a year and a half because it simply wasn't fun and I'd essentially unlocked every achievement. Started back up on Sunday or Monday and have gone through the first act and up through Maghda on the second act, and have gotten andariel's visage, a bul-kathos wedding band, nagelring, bombadier's rucksack, blackthorne necklace and pants, and most recently, danetta's revenge a pretty awesome 1h crossbow! And all of them have useful stats for my demon hunter thanks to the 2.0 changes. It's actually been fun playing and finding loot again. I'm not sold on the expansion yet though, 40 bucks for one additional class and one extra act seems incredibly steep. I think I'd get my moneys worth but I just dunno if I wanna drop that much without knowing if any friends are going to pick it up too. Anywho, my bnet id is ianthekorean#1845 feel free to add me! 

 There's 2 more things that the expansion will be doing outside of a new class and a new act that might make it all worth the $40, the inclusion of a new game mode and a new mechanic. The new game mode is called Nephalem Rifts where, after accessing an obelisk, you enter a completely randomized special dungeon with multiple levels. Reach the end, kill the boss, and get fat stacks of loot. The dungeons can apparently change so much that even their tilesets will be different as you go down, thus randomizing the monsters you fight even more. The other thing is called bounties where you're assigned a randomized task to perform, from killing a specific boss to hunting super unique monsters to clearing specific dungeons. Complete the bounty and get loot. 

 I was one of the many who near instantly quit Diablo 3 when it came out. I got my Wizard and Demon Hunter to 60 and was pretty much done with the game. I came close to getting my Barbarian to 60 as well, but it daunted on me that I didn't give a flying hell about the game. I've been on and off the game since the last patch and I have to say the game is infinitely better than what it was before. The only issue I have with the game now is that since Loot 2.0 was introduced, finding upgrades is far too lenient to the point I've already hit the upper cap of what you could get. For example... I went from 50,000 Damage to 190,000 Damage in less than 24 hours. It takes me roughly 3 days worth of play to find an upgrade, and all the upgrades I get are not substantial in the least. You're looking at things like +0.01% Damage, -2.3% Toughness on my upgrades. A lot of my friends who play are also starting to hit the upper cap of upgrades too. Some haven't had an upgrade in nearly 2 weeks. This may be the limitation of Level 60 gear, but I can imagine Level 70 gear will see the same kinds of caps. While it may not be nearly as devastating as the Auction House, they move the source of contention from the AH to the Loot 2.0 system. You'll hit the upper caps of upgrades very, VERY fast. However, it'll take you substantially longer to replace said gear, which kind of defeats the purpose of Diablo's gameplay mechanic in the first place. Yes, you'll go through in hopes of finding better gear, but they made the pool of potential options smaller per class so the variance is smaller. Basically, what I'm getting at is, you'll looking at a bell-curve upgrade, the same that you saw with the AH. Diablo 3 needs to move back to a linear upgrade path. It's what keeps the player in the game, knowing that you're feeding into their needs and desire to find better gear. You don't exactly accomplish that if you instantly get to the upper tiers within the first couple of hours of the level cap.

 Well part of the problem during the AH period was that you couldn't find the upgrades needed to complete the ridiculously unbalanced end game Inferno levels without using the AH. While the scaling might be too lenient now it was a hell of a lot further in the opposite direction before 2.0. Fixing a lot of the Elite and Champion mob behavior, removing or altering a lot of the affixes for those mobs, and toning the damage down a ton while providing a more sensible sliding scale for difficulty at the end game in Torment mode have solved a ton of those issues. Ideally Blizzard might just make a lot of the top tier end game stuff obtainable through recipes like the Hellfire Ring. Sure it can be frustrating running through an area to get a special boss for a chance at a drop, but it feels like an accomplishment when you do manage to clear those hurdles and craft some nifty gear at the end. 

 yea i heard bad things at first too...that's why i didn't buy it till monday...hah iv just been grinding trying to get a character ready for the expansion, was surprised when i learned about the paragon lvl system .... i only have my wizard atm lvl60 with 21 paragon

The thing to remember about this is that 60 isn't the cap anymore, the kind of gear we're finding now at level 60 is meant to be gear that's part of the leveling process to the new cap. People who had item level 63 gear before aren't going to find upgrades in 2.0, they've already got better than they're supposed to. Everything's tuned to level 70 now. There's definitely the potential of something similar happening at level 70. But a lot more work has gone into that end-game gear than the levelling 60 gear we're hunting for now. It could be just as bad but I doubt it, finding really good stuff will probably be a slow but steady process if what I'm seeing now is any indication. One of the stranger problems that's cropped up is that gearing up your follower is now an enormous pain in the ass if they use a different primary stat than you. This can be fixed relatively easily down the road, but for the moment it's absolute butts. Thankfully, if you're playing this game right, you're playing it with other people anyway and you won't really need your follower to begin with. 

 I already pre-purchased the Standard Edition two months ago and I just recently upgraded it to Digital Deluxe. I have all the Diablo games including Hellfire, the unofficial expansion of Diablo, and I just have to say that I love the story and the lore of Diablo. That is the main reason why people even bother buy a Blizzard game because of the story, which why I bought it, and/or the others well are for the end game. Now, I played Diablo III before patch 2.0.1 and I hated the difficulty system, where you have to beat the whole game to go up the difficulty, but I'm glad that they removed that and let you manually pick which difficulty to choose from besides Torment which you need to hit 60. The reason why I pre-purchased it because I'm a fan of the Diablo series, and it shouldn't really matter what directions Blizzard went, and you could tell that they had to resurrect (beating a dead horse) the Diablo story from Diablo II. I played and beat the current game solo excluding Act V (which I will be doing too), and at first, the story is a bit iffy, but the gameplay and atmosphere of Diablo is still there and there's still voiced NPC, there's even now audiologs which I loved. However, as you progress through the story, you're getting more sense of whats going on and that you get to places that you haven't before. Blizzard makes sure that in fact that you're play a Blizzard game, which is polished and addicting, even the menu buttons are fun to click. I loved it from the beginning and to the current story, excluding Act V. I'm glad that they decided to go forward with removing AH, and actually making a game than a business. Now, from what I've heard, that Blizzard is going to release a couple or few of expansions and that's it, which is going to be a sad day at least for me as it is the only game I actually follow and love. I play a Monk and my battletag is ClassicNexus#1917.

Thankfully, if you're playing this game right, you're playing it with other people anyway and you won't really need your follower to begin with. I find that the problem with the Follower is that they ruined the system involving them. Back in Diablo II, everyone in the game could have a Follower so you can walk around with 8 Players and 8 Followers. Diablo 3 can certainly benefit from allowing Followers to be with you, regardless of whether you're in a Multiplayer game or not. My Wolf Companion gets wrecked in Torment 4+, I can't see why a Follower wouldn't get wrecked too. As far as balancing goes, I also don't see how it would break the game. Although, I would not be entirely surprised if it's a system that they simply didn't deem important because there was a larger game that was mostly broken that only a small handful of people can play and enjoy. To be quite honest, the game has a "Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn" kind of feel right now. The original game sold gangbusters and a lot of people didn't like what they saw. They then spend the next 2 years just fixing the game and making it closer to what the original vision should've been. Some of the remnants of the old guard might be there and may have an update later. I can certainly tell you that the Follower System is like the Airship System in FFXIV, in that it's there. It's usable but ultimately, it makes little to no sense in the scheme of things right now.

 Eh beta was fun. Getting items and item progression seems fun. I like the idea of the rifts and I had massive amoutns of fun in beta. Decided to spend some cash and just go for it. I also agree with Ian I am hesitant if this will be worth the money but youi know what? Screw it. I was impressed how much blizzard actually decided to change and address. I enjoyed my first play through of D3 alot and i'm sure when I can game with friends tonight it will be fun as hell again. (WE ARE GETTING YELLOWSKIN AGAIN BOYS!) anyway pretty sure I got all you people on here. I'll be on tonight getting that sweet sweet error 37.

 I quit D3 soon after buying it because it was a pretty terrible game all in all, but RoS is a large improvement. I'm currently playing a witch doctor with around 600,000 damage. Torment VI is really hard but drops quite a few legendaries every hour even at the slower speed that I clear it. 
 RoS is definitely what D3 should have been all along, glad to see they finally gave fans what they wanted even if it took them two extra years. I just finished Act V on my Wizard at lvl 67 but I'm having too much fun leveling a Crusader to make it all the way to 70.

 got thunderfury, odyns son, and some other legendaries. GG d3.

 D3 expansion came out, thinking about getting but I remembered how much I didn't really care for D3. Decide to try "Path of Exile," currently I'm able to summon 7 skeletons, 6 zombies, and 2 spectral projections of enemies. Dunno if I can ever go back to D3 now. I was super skeptical of PoE when I heard the words "Free to Play" and "microtransactions" but so far I couldn't be more pleased, it looks like all the microtransactions are vanity related. I'm not trying **** on D3 or convert anyone, it's just not my cup of tea. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 Well I played and beat Reaper of Souls (Act V) campaign, that was sure a long one (2-3 hours worth, even more if you trying to explore everything). There's a lot of side quests to do, not just in Act V, but in every Act. In the beginning, it kinda dragged out and it just took hours just to search the whole place, heaven forbid that you get disconnected or lose the game, you'd have to all that again unless you just want to skip it, but that's still annoying. I tried the Crusader, and it was pretty cool, I played up until level 19, but just deleted it because I just liking have one character - I'm a Perfectionist or a purist. Also, it was somewhat boring for me because I really don't like their philosophy, it is too strict if you will. The loot system is better than previously, and stronger gems drop now, and your companion automatically levels with you. I did hear that they're going to bring Ladder and Non-Ladder from Diablo 2 and bringing into Diablo 3, which makes a whole lot interesting and gives the end-game more competition. So yeah I enjoyed it, but as I said in my previous post, I bought it just for the story and the lore. So I just uninstalled it, and I might install it again who knows. I give Diablo 3 previously before the Expansion: 3.5/5, it was luckluster, and the difficulties were just annoying - you have to get through the story 5 times. I give Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls Expansion: 3/5. It's a good expansion, but it doesn't really change something important. I give Diablo 3 after the Expansion: 4/5, the expansion did add and gave purpose to it, but If you're looking for a smash and bash than this isn't for you. However, if you're looking for a good story, cinematic, lore, and gameplay than surely you will not be disappointed. Cheers

 I just found a nearly perfect Manajuma's so my damage spiked up to 700k (after a couple of other upgrades). I'll go for 1m this weekend. 
 Honestly, I would have to say that the only quarrels right now are four main things. 1. We need chat rooms like in Diablo 2 2. We need Game names like in Diablo 2 which means that no more of this auto join games with random ass people. No more joining games based on brawling,monster slaying or whatever. With chat rooms combined with that the community will feel a LOT more involved with each other! Plus you can make a game that's purpose is to just mess around doing nothing and B/S if you wanted too! 3. Tyrial Needs at LEAST 5-6 more lines to say while he is Idle in town! He says the same two things over again about his stomach being funny feeling and why are you starting at kadala? Really annoying! 4. Needs the return of Charms IMO. 5. Enemy animations needs a overhaul! At least for 1/3 of the enemies! Too many do not feel like they are different then each other. D2 it felt like very single character had a attack pattern all its own. All the ghosts feel the same, all of the enemies feel the same as the rest. There needs to be a little variety and enemy attacks need to be done differently so more of them feel like the attacks have a actual "weight" to the attacks they are doing. If these changes were made then d3 would officially be greater the 2 despite the lack of stats and skill tree.

 Charms as they were in D2 were awful. They took up too much space and just weren't worth the effort. Not sure why you want a chat room. Interfaces like the old B.net just meant more things had to be built and maintained and more things could break. I am of the opinion that games are for games, you wanna chat get in IRC. 

 I think the addition of Clan's and Community's is far better than the clunky system that D2 had. Though I still think a public lobby list would be better than the random search system that the game still has. Charms were really annoying because they took up what little bag space you already had so I don't miss them.

The 2.0 update for D3 is definitely a huge improvement over what was released at launch though, and the expansion goes even further in those improvements. So if you own D3 already, might not be a terrible idea to relaunch or reinstall and give it a whirl after the vanilla improvements and decide on getting the expansion based on whether or not ya like it more than you did originally. 

 I picked up diablo 3 this afternoon for the ps3. It should be interesting. Thanks for suggesting it in my other thread. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 If Blizzard would just rip-off PoE and bring back talent trees or even better, a giant sphere grid for each class, and have a new ladder system then I would never need to go outside again.

 Core of Arreat runs nerfed! It's about time. It's so anti-fun to imagine that you have to just run to the same chest over and over again to try and keep up in items. I honestly feel that the way rifts/bounties are currently balanced is perfect. Maybe every six or seven or so rift runs I'll come across a legendary. I also like how the legendaries have a lot of unique traits to them now. My current chestpiece gives me a 100% chance to crit when I'm under 25% health, and my shoulders make my town portal uninterruptible. May not be the most useful thing in the world, but it's kind of cool for them to keep things unique like that. 
 Yeah, Shi Mizu's Haori is neat but I want my f*cking Cindercoat. /mad
