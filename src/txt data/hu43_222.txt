 Kaichou wa Maid-sama
 I just finished watching this show yesterday. It starts off good but slows to a crawl really quick in terms of romance progression. It has no plot and is similar to kyo no Go no Ni in that it is just a bunch of unrelated stories thrown together. But I love it fro some reason. I guess the comedy mad up for what is was lacking. It is like Kimi ni Todoke with no plot. lol
