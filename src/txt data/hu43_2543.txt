 What do people around you think about you watching anime ?
 I don't usually bring it up, but if it comes up I don't hide it. I think the trick is finding a group of friends who respect you for who you are, with the understanding nobody is gonna have the exact same interests. I have some friends who are into anime(a couple I converted), others think it's ****, they are still my friends. For someone who doesn't understand it I'll usually try and pick a title tailored to them and suggest they come over to my place for movie night. I have a friend who really likes violent movies, but thought anime was all little kids stuff. I showed him berserk and he actually got into it and watched the whole thing. Studio Ghibli films or cowboy bebop are also pretty good choices for people who don't understand what anime is about.
