 The Tenchi series... what's the best universe?
 I've only watched the OVA, Muyo, In Tokyo, and the 3 movies. I have not seen the later series. Now I just heard that Ryo-oki continues the OVA universe, so I have to check that out. I like the second movie (Daughter of Darkness). The OVA and Muyo were both excellent. I can't really decide.
