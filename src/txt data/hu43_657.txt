 Spielberg Cartoons
 Maybe it's just me but it seems like American cartoons have gone downhill since Spielberg stopped making animated series. Starting with Tiny Toons and going on for years he kept making fantastic series... and then he just stopped. I don't suppose anyone could start a petition to get him back?
