[General Discussion] Thoughts on Marriage ?
 What are everyone's thoughts on marriage ? Like one side of thinks, well it's just a piece of paper and an over expensive event. The other side is excited, at the thought of one day marrying a fine lady. Now I am only 19, that needs to be said so I am very young but I think it would be more of a gesture of love if I were to get married. For instance, if the person I love really wants a wedding, then because of that I would get married. I also love the look of some wedding dresses obviously not for me. But deep down the cynical side of me knows that marriages don't last long, and it's just a piece of paper. Do you really need that event and document, to commit to each other ?. Surely getting a 30 year mortgage with someone is commitment ?
