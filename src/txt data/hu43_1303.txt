 Favorite Gundam series?
 Zeta Gundam: This is my favorite Gundam because was the most dark in the franchise with Victory, F91 and Crossbone, this Gundam shows how enemies work together for the same objective, has one of the most interestinc characters, Sirocco, and the animation is perfect for the 80s. Gundam 0079: The Gundam that starts all, charismatic characters like Amuro, Bright Noa, Ramba Ral, and Char Aznable; Is easy to understand and apreciate.
