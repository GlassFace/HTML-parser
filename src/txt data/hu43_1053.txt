 Please don't respond to spambots.
 Regarding profile spam. Please report any bots on your profiles, but go ahead and delete their posts yourself. If the bot name already has a strike through it's name, it's already banned so just delete any posts left behind on your wall. Chances are that they've spammed several profiles and it makes our job easier if people clean up any left over posts that we didn't get. It's harder to get all of those than it is for regular posts. Thank you
