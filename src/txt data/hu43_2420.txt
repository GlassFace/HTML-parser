[Mecha] Kenzen Robo Daimidaler
 Kōichi Madanbashi is a high schooler who possesses Hi-ERo particles, which are used as an energy source for the robot Daimidaler. He obtains these particles by groping females, and uses them to power up the robot in order to fight penguin-shaped robots from the evil Penguin Empire. Kenzen Robo Daimidaler (健全ロボ ダイミダラー "Daimidaler the Sound Robot") is a manga series by Asaki Nakama, serialized in Enterbrain's seinen manga magazine Fellows! from 2008 to 2012 and collected in four tankōbon volumes. A sequel titled Kenzen Robo Daimidaler OGS began serialization in the same magazine (now called Harta) from October 2013. An anime television series adaptation by TNK is scheduled to air from April 10, 2014. It has been licensed for legal streaming by FUNimation.

 Yes, the ecchi Evangelion series. I couldn't get passed the first 10 minutes because it was so appalling.

 This show is hilarious and has decent fanservice. That's all it is though, and is all that it has running for it aside from what I consider to be it's romantic venture and shallow plot. Still freakin' hilarious imo. Worth a full watch due to it's comedy, ecchi, and very weak romantic development. Inauspicious is just not embracing the front tail fin way.

 So after episode six... DAIMIDALER. AH **** (ACTION). ****ing amazingly ridiculous, hilarious, great ****ing would-bang 10/10 show. So after episode seven... I already miss the old MC, but these new ones and the new Daimidaler type are really likable. Love the dialogues. After the latest episode: Really like the consistent plot progression. The Penguin Emperor is so incomplete in their evil, I love the bad guys more than the good guys.

 After ep nine: Child Ritz is fakking adorable. Modern Ritz has cute "engrish". RITZRITZRITZ ♥ Morning Ritzness. Woah, what's going on with Type-1's power arm?! Also, why is the Penguin Empire so generous and awesome? **** mankind. After ep 10: Wow, I look at the OP with such a new perspective. Those lyrics, platinum. Those uncensored anime titties, completely revolutionary. No, what happened to our cool new protagonist duo?! Noooo! Still love Ritz's "engrish". Woah, the Super Antarctic looks spectacular. OH **** man, that ending was fumping bad-ass. After the latest ep: No! The tits have vanished! NYUUUU Again, the government turns into the enemy. That military guy had a seriously sinister expression, man, jesus! Beauty Salon Prince, even if you harm more than you help, I don't want you gone! The scientists, we NEED TO PROTECT THE SCIENTISTS. Dey som fine azz *****ez Shouma, snap out of it breddah. Also, Penguin Emperor-- what is going on, what have you done?!

 Ritz is awesome, I love her Engrish and looks. The Super Sound Diamidaler looks cool, those wings and hair are wicked. The berserk mode looks even cooler! I like how the professors even got their own spotlight, even if they did make the Super Sound go apeshit with its las0rz. Kiriko's relationship troubles are funny as hell, I love her character's personality towards Penguin Shouma. lol Henry's intervention was great. Oh man, the two couples' power-ups are HAWT, silly as hell though but that's what makes it funny! Awww, Ritz is lonely! D'AWWWW Oh man, the Administrator gave such a badass, silly speech! **** yeah man, right on. Oh, oh man! The wrap-up is so peaceful, but the Penguin Empire is leaving! WWWWAAAUURGH I DON'T WANT THEM TO GO Yessss, this series was such a ****ing joke, it was fantastic. 8/10 my funny bone and erotic bone were tickled so much while watching this show. Loved it. 
 The bare titties on those specials...much appreciated fanservice! They even acknowledge it! I do wonder, why does one of the Professors get so flustered about that paper stuffed in her nose? Ritz is crazy! She's giving hand-jobs to all the penguins like a maniac! What a smexy body though. This battle is quite fierce...and erotic. Penguin Emperor comes to save the day. Even the teacher and the ultimate couple got a special...Penguin Empire proves how great they are with their ecologically safe perv solvent. More bare titties, yay. The special episode with the Penguin 69 was a montage masterpiece. The mochi party was the tits...no literally. Nice specials. They teetered on being hentai, but were still funny.
