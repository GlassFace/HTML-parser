 Marvel Films You're Waiting For?
 Marvel Films You're Waiting For? So being a Marvel fan I obviously keep up to date with the latest news for their latest films, currently my favorite franchise of theirs so far is probably 'The Amazing Spider-man' or possibly 'Captain America'. Personally I have my eyes on Captain America 3 coming May, 2015. I thought the second was brilliant and definitely a step up from the first (which was okay, nothing special). I'm also pretty excited for the new Avengers movie "Age of Ultron". I found a list of dates for new Marvel films, unfortunately I don't know if it's accurate though it gives an idea of the estimated dates for their release. Obviously we can't say these are for sure. May 1, 2015  "The Avengers: Age of Ultron" July 17, 2015 - "Ant-Man" May 6, 2016 - "Captain America 3" July 8, 2016 - "Doctor Strange" July 28, 2017 - "Guardians Of The Galaxy 2" You can find the list here, it also seems that Disney will debut certain Marvel hero television series due to a newly made partnership. Again this is most likely an inaccurate website so to speak, I'll try and find something a bit more reliable to post in the comments. So what are you waiting for?
