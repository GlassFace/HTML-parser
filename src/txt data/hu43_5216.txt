When a series deteriorates, I am like that as well and I just can't bring myself to finish it. I do trust his judgement. Does it improve, or get worse as it goes on? Books 1-3 are some of the best fantasy I've ever read. Book 4 is hard to follow but still easy to appreciate. It just slows down. It's still good fantasy. Book 5 was actually quite good in a lot of respects. The main problem with GoT is that it gets very confusing because he tends to introduce a lot of characters that you think you should know, but can't possibly remember.
