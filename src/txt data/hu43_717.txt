 VA Revival - Small Announcement
 I just want people to know that I am back. My school stuff is all done and dusted this week and I have more time for A4. From the start of this thread, we did implement some community ideas, but there are some that we didn't get around to doing. Okesia unfortunately got busy IRL while I was busy with school, so SoTW got put on hold. That's coming back now. If there's anything else people would like to see happening in VA, let us know. One thing that we did have on the cards is a thread prefix system for VA. I am going to bring this back up again with the admin and see if we can get that going to make this forum a little more organised. 
 Do you RP, or are you interested in learning? Join our Role Player's Society here on A4. Would you like a baseball bat to shove up your ass along with that stick? You're a mod, please act like one A4 is on FACEBOOK
