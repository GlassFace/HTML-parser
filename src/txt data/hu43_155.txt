 Europe one step ahead again?
 Biometrics aren't really -that- safe. For a professional view on it, take a course in computer security and it will most likely have a topic about biometrics and problems with it that makes it suboptimal (I have done this, so I'm just not pulling this out of my ass). For a more "layman" view, there was this mythbusters episode where they attempted to fool fingerprint readers and such. It was quite silly how easy it was to fool one of those systems. I would not feel safe if they replaced the regular ATM's with biometric ATM-thingies, I'd most likely switch banks.
