[Anime] Anime you wish for to be real?
 What the title says, post what animes who you wish exists and why. I would have to say Pokemon. I hate the anime, but the plot is interesting enough to make me wish I was a part of the series. The adventures to capture and train pokemon would be a blast for me. P.S. My starter Pokemon would be Charmander. 
 So many books, so little time.
 Pokemon- I would travel the land with my Umbreon and we would kick ***. Naruto- I would be a leaf shinobi in a squad with two of my friends. Attack on Titan- I would be in the recon corps and probably get eaten. It would still be cool to use that 3D Maneuver Gear 
 "Some things are hard to understand - like jellyfish. Do you understand jellyfish? People are like jellyfish to me. I don't understand." Rin Tezuka- Katawa Shoujo
 I think there was a thread similar to this before, but anyways I would say Sword Art Online because of the Seed 
  Spoiler 
 I wish Naruto was for real. 
 Either the world of pokemon, the world of yugioh, the world of bodacious space pirates, the world of durarara, the world of baccano, or the world of angelic layer. Either one of those would be sweet

 Either Sword Art Online or Vampire Knight!

 Sword art online - Mainly because if it were real it would probably be that Elder Scrolls Online was the game I'd have to beat. And dude, I ****ing love and kick the ass of elder scrolls games. Pokemon - Quit school at age 10 to go around, killing girls pets, then getting their numbers? Sign me up. Any harem - Get maw****in *****es left 'n right. Any ecchi - Self explanatory. Any hentai - Self explanatory. 
 I want to take a ride in Howl's moving castle! Always thought I'd love to travel across the earth in a walking house.

I want to be surrounded by hot guys *Q* And fall in love with Zero Kiryu, WAAAAAH And meet you in a video game! SO SHUUSH 
 
 I asked my friend this question before, he answered by saying Kampfer. Freaked me out a little bit, but i guess he has his reasons. It would be cool if "Sunday Without God" was real in a way. You would live basically forever unless someone/something kills you. Then even if you die, you turn into the dead and continue living.

 Mostly all of my favorite series. Inuyasha - I want to be a yokai and fight Naraku with Inuyasha and the Gang. Naruto - I will an Akatsuki and marry Itachi. *evil grin* Shingeki no Kyouji - I will join the Recon Corps and fight the Titans with my Titan power. (Can I wish to the most beautiful Titan alive? No? Okay.) or Any Yaoi - You know what I mean.

 Probably Sword Art Online because playing that game would be cool as heck, yo. Attack on Titan would just be scary.. I don't want to be eaten. T_T 
 My Anime List
 none because in any anime only main character matters. so no one would mind themselves being in an anime setting while they themselves might have absolutely no ability to contribute to anything. Unless people insert themselves into the main character's position, there is absolutely nothing to gain from this. you can actually end up being the guy that dies in the first episode lol. 
 Pokemon, defenitly Pokemon. Though a Charizard that doesn't listen would take a whole different turn in the real world.. :/

 If i could have the world of OHSHC at my fingertips...i would be all over kyoya (: 
 I feel like i answered a question like this before? Clearly dragon ball z. I could fly, manifest tangible energy, scream for an incredible duration. Also i could fight badass enemies with annoying voices. And if everybody is killed, i bring them back with dragon balls and because of that, later i get to fight awe inspiring dragon warriors! What is not to like!

 Pokemon cause its epic and with the pokemon having powers Beyblade cause of tye blades and dragoon Naruto because of the jutsus 
 I think most of you are right, Pokemon, that would be amazing. The main reason, is that its not too crazy and it would be amazing to have a pet that could listen to you and level up etc. I also think most mecha animes would be sweet. Have a gundam instead of a car. I would love that. Oh and I would choose Eevee, Vulpix, or Charmander and their respective evolution's. (Flareon for Eevee's evolution of course.)

 It is never too late to change, but you have to start now.
 for sure pokemon, would love to have a ratata 
 Its not the face that makes a monster. Its the choices they make with their life. Uzumaki Naruto 
 Definitely Baccano you guys know any alchemists with strange elixers, pm me. 
 Soul Eater. It would be cool to fight with a partner and there is more to learn about fighting then there is in Naruto... and I feel like there isn't any BULLSHIT disadvantages. 

 Pokemon- Who wouldnt want to travel around regions catching all the pokemon know to manking and becoming a league champion? ^^ Naruto- I would be one heck of a ninja Kaichou wa Maid-sama!- I just want to spy on Usui from afar :3
