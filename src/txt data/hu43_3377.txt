 An anime similar to Tokyo Ghoul?
 I am going to be straight forward about it. I just finished watching the episodes they have made of Tokyo Ghoul, and I'm reading it. Are there any other anime out there you would recommend after watching Tokyo Ghoul? As you may or may not know, there is lots of blood in Tokyo Ghoul. There is a lot of drama. It even gets really dark at some point. For some reason I like that! I've already watched Attack on Titan (if you even put that in the same category as Tokyo Ghoul, idk) I won't give you my whole list, but if you've watched Tokyo Ghoul, then you'll know what I'm looking for.
