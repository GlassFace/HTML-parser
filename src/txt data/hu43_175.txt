 Antisemitism in Red Dead Redemption

There is a fine line between being racist and using racism. In the GTA games there was racism because it it adds to the characters depth or in some cases to display just how shallow the character may be. It doesn't make the game racist it makes the character racist and can add to the games realism. Just so you know the time period and location for the game was not fond of immigrants and 3 major immigrant groups that come to mind are Irish, Jewish, and Chinese. There was also no love for the Native Americans who were considered nothing more than a savage wild animal and not human. If it fits with in the context of the story and atmosphere it doesn't make the game racist it takes more to do that and Im not getting into this further as I'm tired of ranting. Someone give this man a cookie. IMHO this man has provided the perfect answer. Seriously, it's about the wild west. It's historically accurate. You can't (and shouldn't) change history just because "it's offensive". Sure, antisemitism is bad. But it's history, pretending that it never existed isn't going to solve anything. Also, where's the discussion about how offensive killing muslims is in pretty much any game set in modern day where you go up against "terrorism"?
