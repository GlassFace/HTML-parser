 Kino's Journey OST - Piano Cover
 I'm a huge fan of Kino's Journey and I fell in love with this track while watching the anime. Unfortunately it was never included in the official OST so I have no idea what it's called. Plus I couldn't find any sheets anywhere. This is the first cover I've done completely by ear. The bass was pretty difficult to work out considering the original song is played with just a flute and it's really rough compared to my other covers, but thanks for listening.
