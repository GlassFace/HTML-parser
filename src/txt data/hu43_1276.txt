 I think people should read it more if it helps. since theres a lot who are having serious problems with being unpopular or being popular in a bad way as outcasts etc. 
I am cute and i am amazing and fun, how can you hate me? how can you not like me really??? 
 Second episode was even better than episode one. In my opinion, best anime this season. Not sure if anyone agrees, but yeah. 
Anime Casuals make me: 
 Yeah I've caught up with the manga forever ago. I wasn't surprised it got an anime considering its quality. It also will make you feel almost as much of a perv as the main character is (can't remember her name lol). Not sure if that qualifies as spoilers, but I think its safe. :3 I could see myself watching this in my spare time. 

 I love her 'sexual' fantasies XD and lewd thinking EPIC ANIMEEE

I'm not watching a lot of the currently airing anime, but I'd definitely agree! It's made me laugh out loud more in just 2 episodes than a lot of series have in their entirety! And the ED is so cute ;w; Originally Posted by Just a dream Such a long name Q.Q I just shorten it to watamote :3 
 at first, i was suprised that it would have a an anime release,not because it was bad or anything. i've been reading the manga and was absolutely thrilled when i heard that it'll be in an anime XD 
 thanks for my friend for making me this cute signature! <3  Spoiler https://soundcloud.com/sachiko-03

 Episode 3 was my favourite by far, so many funny moments. I love the awkward humor.

 I feel awful for Tomoko. That old professor made her cry. And the neighbor was hesitant about sharing his text book, what garbage. And she was looking at the stream and got yelled at again! BUt I enjoyed the episode. 

 I've been enjoying this anime the most (well about the same as shingeki no kyojin) than any other anime this season. It makes me laugh so hard, so far the anime is just as good as the manga.

Oh god and the Father walking in on her SLeeping XD 

 omg. When the father ewalked in had me rolling. But even before that, When she was with her friend and was having some serious yuri thoughts. At first I was like" Well, she's just not thinking about what she's saying." But no. She went so far to say how...happy she would be if that was her girlfriend. ultimate lolzz. 

 Oh man I wonder what the dad was thinking at the end of this weeks episode. He was probably like "You know what. I don't even want to know."

 Tomoko is cute I dont care what anyone says! This last episode was kinda uncomfortable though, but I kept laughing through it. Also what the heck was with that new ending theme?? Haha 

 I didn't like this episode as much as the others. It was still funny though.
