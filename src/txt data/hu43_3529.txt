 Netstorm style RTS game play gets reboot in 3D
 After several weeks of back and forth with the art team and modeling team we at Storm Isle Productions are pleased to showcase the first look of the newly modeled and textured Rain faction "Ice Cannon" with the initial model done we will be implementing it into a coming build for further demonstrating of the new unit model in-game soon... Be sure to drop us a comment and let us know what you think! Also if you have not dropped by our steam green-light then be sure to help drop us some support http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfile.../?id=294002132
