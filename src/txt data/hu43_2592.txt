[Mecha] Argevollen (Shirogane no Ishi Argevollen)
 A mother already, what?! Well they just flailed themselves and Arge...lol. "PASTA!" That line had me rolling. Richtofen is going bananas once again, oh my god! Big Red, Arge, and Ghost all converging...this is going to get epic. Cayenne's here, and he's pissed. I expect "Dear Sister" to begin playing. Woah, of all people she comes to deny him of blissful death?! LOL WTF Suguro's death is so wack! I'm glad to see a happy ending, and that little teaser at the end was also decently done. All in all, an okay anime with solid writing, action, and a nice soundtrack.
