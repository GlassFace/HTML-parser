 Please share your thoughts and experiences with fitness trackers
 OK I preordered the pivotal living fitness tracker. It hasn't come yet so I'm curious about fitness trackers. Does anyone here have one? Do you wear it all the time? Has it helped you set new personal goals with your training? I bought mine because its only twelve dollars a year and they will send new versions for free with the subscription. So please share your experiences with fitness trackers. Thanks.
