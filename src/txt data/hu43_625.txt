 What Would You Pilot?
 If you where a first class anime pilot what would you operate? Can be a mecha, veichle, spaceship exct... So many I can think of that would be awesome but to start out these would be a couple of my first choices Liger Zero RZ-041 This biomechanical life form is from one of my all time fave anime series zoids. Liger Zero Zero is equipped with a interchangable CAS system that allows the user to switch through multiple types for combat speed attack and deffense. Weapons included are Double-Barrelled Shock Cannon, AZ 108 mm and a High-Density Beam Gun. I'd love to take this baybe for a spin. Ryo ohki spaceship The most powerful spaceship in the galaxy Â Spoiler Ok technically Tsunami is said to be the most powerful but as we learn later in the series Washus gems have the same properties as Light Hawk Wings and ends up being revealed that Washu is a Godess herself so it's on equal footing and it has broken through Jirais defences before anyhoo...XD from the Tenchi Muyo series. Not much to say other than it's just freakin cool and who else can say there spaceship can turn into a rabiit er I mean chobit or actually it's the other way around haha. Wing Zero My all time fav mecha it's just glorious look at those angelic wings! boy what what I would give for a chnce to fire off the Twin Buster Rifle cannon pure sweetness!
