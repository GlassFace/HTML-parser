[General Discussion] What was your first job?
 Hardees (Carl's Jr for you west coast folks) when I was 16 for a summer job. This was back when they still served fried chicken and a bunch of other side dishes and stuff so working in the kitchen meant actual cooking. Not just assembling burgers with a side of fries. Of course they weren't supposed to be able to force someone under 18 to work in the kitchen, nor hold them past midnight, nor stop a minor from taking a mandatory half hour break during an 8 hour shift. Being a naive kid though I didn't know any of that and just tried to work hard. Which was pointless since the store owner was probably the most hateful person I've ever known, and she rarely did anything that qualified as work during my shift. She'd just lock herself in the office to "count money" during the last four hours of the day leaving me all alone in the place to clean as no one else stayed past 9pm. Ended up quitting after about 3 months of that. She ended up being shot and killed in a robbery at the store few months later and the only thing I felt was relief that I wasn't still working there.
