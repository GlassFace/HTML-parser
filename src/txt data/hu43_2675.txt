[Event] Anime Review Competition
 Because this isn't the most fun event and it requires participants to put in some time and effort, there's going to be a fairly nifty prize. The winner will receive an Amazon Gift card worth $40 (or your regional equivalent). Which can go toward your next anime, video game, e-book, love pillow, etc. You kids should know what Amazon is. However if the winner comes from a country which amazon doesn't ship to we'll try to compensate the best we can.
