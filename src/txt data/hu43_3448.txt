 I know she is my character and by default I have total control of her power, but like keeping characters in character, and when I think of what may happen involving them consider whether or not certain situations would be enough to trigger certain things. Such as time/space power usage. But you are right that the current situation is as good a time as any. But, you had already established that Luminary was going for the unexposed leg. This would Leave Emily unharmed for the most part, and the man incapacitated. My line of thinking here is unless Luminary is targeting her directly, be it before or after dealing with the mafia member, it's not enough of a moment to trigger.
