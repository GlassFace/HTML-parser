 Aaargh, well **** I'm going to feel that dreadful **** that Selector Infected brought when it concluded its first season. I worship "Tales of Aldnoah" and it's going to be a major bummer when they end it for the break. **** **** ****ity ****. 
 OMG! Just watched the last 6 eps or something today. I didn't expect that ending to ep 12. D: D: WHAT? They have some 'splainin to do in January when they show the second half.

 I really just... ...*sigh* Does anybody else think that the whole "giant transformation sequence" was just a little too unserious for this show? It's tone is constantly throwing me. Is it seriously "EPIC" stuff, that requires my utmost attention and sincere admiration? Or is it more "tropish", based off of the "usual" mecha stuff? Because it constantly goes back and forth. And I don't mean that as a compliment. 
 Ending is a good one. Finally after a long time this the first time again that I feel so hype for the 2nd season of an anime thanks to aldnoah and tokyo ghoul. But if asseylum and inaho will not be there it will really make me sad. 
 Had a great ending in my opinion, honestly the best conclusion for the season. I imagine any loose ends will get fully tied up in the next season, It'll be interesting to see how they pull it off though, I really enjoyed the different take on the mecha genre, less about who has the biggest mecha and more about using your head. Also Slaine's character development was brilliant. 
I don't know everything, only what I know.
 Just realized Versians....sounds like "Virgins". That mad me chuckle almost as much as when I began calling Sauzbaam, "Saucebomb". Um...that Kataphrakt's evolution is so complicated, jeez where are all these parts going and doing?! Oh, it's a combo mech of those other Knights's Kataphrakts. Scary, but also really just meh. No, our Military Character who says something cool arrives, but predictably dies right after. The drama. Ruh roh, hopefully the Princess didn't get hurt. Oh what a downer, lame ending of just depressing tragedy. *sigh* What the utter **** is going to happen next? The Butcher strikes again. I'm hoping for  Spoiler the Princess to be revived through Aldnoah's godlike properties, for Inaho to have survived his gunshot, and for Slaine to realize that all his actions harm more than help and it's time to ****ing change that. Also, it was heavily implied Inaho actually has romantic feelings for the Princess...way to **** on my shipping with that reveal and the deaths. 
  Spoiler Save the guy that tries to kill his one-sided love Kill the guy that tries to save his one-sided love Slaine worst character. Saazbaum is not dead and I imagine Asseylum's body was scooped up by Slain and is trying to revive her. 
 
 Love how Slaine was actually a character almost every backed, until the last episode where troves of people changed their opinion on him! xD Somebody said, "Aldnoah.Zero more like **** you Gen Urobuchi." Cried my heart out. 
  Spoiler And they all dropped like flies. realistic ending, pls give us more crazy conclusions on the next season. looking forward to it.

 Inaho still alive. Coming back in s2 with an eyepatch.  Spoiler

(which reminds me of the other Orangee in code geass) Anyway, I noticed this thread is dying or not many of us watching this but I'll just ramp it up. I also came across a thread for it but unused: http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...-Season-2-(TV) My thanks to the OP but I decided to use this thread. Season 2 is currently on air. And it's continuing from Season 1: Originally Posted by Ned Aldnoah.Zero (アルドノア・ゼロ Arudonoa Zero) is an upcoming anime television series produced by Nitroplus and animated by A-1 Pictures and TROYCA. The anime is scheduled to air in July 2014. The director will be Ei Aoki and the original creator is listed as Gen Urobuchi, both of whom had previously collaborated on Fate/Zero. Katsuhiko Takayama will be in charge of writing the scripts for the series. Hiroyuki Sawano will compose the music and Kalafina is credited with performing the opening theme song. The main cast was announced by Ei Aoki at AnimeJapan on March 22, 2014. Okay, I'm a little disappointed that they're doing another mecha instead of something else, but wow what an impressive staff list!! Gen Urobuchi is writing this, Ei Aoki directing it, Nitro+ is the producer, with A-1 and TROYCA animating. Even being a non-fan of mecha, this is bound to be good! I did enjoy Urobuchi's last mecha story he wrote for anime, Suisei no Gargantia (and of course I absolutely love his other works like Madoka Magica and Psycho-Pass). He must be going through a robot phase right now, lol. I remain excited for this one! Latest ep brought the battle to space, very different settings from S1. And both Inaho and Slaine are confronting each other directly this time

 I am pretty tempted to drop this knowing how urobutcher works, but still hoping for a happy-ish Inaho x Asseylum ending. The guy likes tragedies, but most of his works would be fine with happier endings too.

 Picked this up and watched it throughout the week. Pretty good show so far, enjoying the grandoise plot and the "how do we beat the next bad guy?" formula. It's almost structured like a video game, especially in the first season, where every boss has a special ability and the final boss has them all rolled into one. Pretty interesting take on the concept. I really wish that Slaine wasn't the only interesting character, though. Everyone else has been diluted to one or two traits which they act out ad nauseam with almost no variation. They're all archetypes, and archetypes are boring for me. There's also some plot holes and strangeness going on that, if the overall story wasn't so interesting, I'd be obsessively tearing apart right now. It's nothing that was ruin the whole show for me but it could be a lot better. Having said all that this is one of the more interesting shows I've seen in many seasons. Looking forward to the conclusion. 

 I always get the impression that the characters are underdeveloped (not that much for inaho n slaine) and there's no progress at that. The "defeating enemies one by one" patten is gettig old too. Aside from that, A1 really put up great animations here The ending will be a massacre, I'm bracing for that

 Just finished ep4 of the second season. Man that was another really intense episode. The writers really upped heir game for this season. I loved the latest developemnt with Slaine. Really starting to root for him. On the other hand I also really like the people on the Terran side. Especially Marito who had another wonderful bit of character development. I really hope he'll beat his demons someday. Though hopefully in a somewhat realistic manner. Also more Kaizuka please. She's another one of my favourite characters from the show. Harklight still creeps me out though. He's up to something I know it. I'm absolutely convinced he's gonna end up stabbing Slaine in the back eventually. Also I think he knows what really happend to Saazbaum and is not revealing it in order to extort Slaine later. Not sure what his endgame is though. What do you guys think?

 The vers captive is released. And if he finds out asselyum is alive, terran may finally have an insider. But slaine will get in the way and will kill him if he finds out. And Slaine's duel gonna be very important on how the rest of the story will go. Will we have subplot for inko....?

 Just watched the latest episode. Very intrigued though this episode left me somewhat lees impressed than the previous one did. Not surprising though as this was mostly just the set' up to what I assume wil be next week's pay off. I wonder what it will eventually all lead up to. So far this season had very strong plotting (a few convenient plot elements aside) Hopefully they can keep it up to the finale. I really liked Rayet's own mini arc this episode. As well as that little scene betweem Inaho and Kaizuka. It's good to see that despite the grandiose plot and all the scheming the writers haven't forgotten that at it's core the show is stille about the individual characters and how they deal with the war they have been thrust into. Very interested in how the duel between Slayne and Marylcian will turn out. Idefinately have an idea which way it's gonna go but this show has caught me by surprise. Anyway good episode. Very anxious towards the next one.

 Yeah I noticed rayet is becoming steady and more trusting in her friends. And she seems to be well aware of her own issues.I'm kinda missing her rogue character now Hahha

They could've easilly fallen for the shonen trope of "these guys are my friends and I'll fight to the death for them" but instead they still show her as being outwardly sullen and antagonistic while at the same time also showing her following at least Inaho and suggesting that she has warmed up a bit to her new companions. It's that kind of solid writing why I like Aldnoah Zero so much. And it's much more apparent this season than it was last one.

 I'm really loving this season so far, I just marathoned the first six episodes of season two earlier. The OST for this season is really wonderful, I find myself enthralled in some of the scenes due to its spectacular music. I'm really hating and loving Gen Urobuchi right now, he's weaved this dramatic Sci-Fi plotline, and I'm always wondering when someone's going to die or how something's going to go bad as I watch. It's SO THRILLING.
