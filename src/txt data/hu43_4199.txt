Although you knew they were 2013, plus I don't recall seeing them nominated. Now you are why this why that again. Dude you are going to have work harder to get someone irritated/upset. Got that? Another thing , there were not so many nominations. There was a decent number though. The only thing I missed were two nominations made my snappy. I've seen most of the comments around and really you have no place to whine because let's be honest and say that most of people didn't even bother to nominate everything (including myself)..since you can nominate only one member/show/movie and that was really crucial.
