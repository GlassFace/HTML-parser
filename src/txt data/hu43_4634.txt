[Anime] Random Disco Music
 I just finished the Rose of Versailles (It's beautiful, if I was in a different mood I would have cried, I can't believe how it ended) and I love it and the soundtrack. So I was listening to the album and there are random disco tracks in the middle XD! I never actually heard that in the show at all. I love it but does anime usually do that where the soundtrack has tracks that never appear in the show??
