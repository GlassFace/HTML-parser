 Drunk Girl Video Confirmed as Hoax
 The clip stars actress Jennifer Box, 24, who teeters on high heels while drinking from a paper bag. The clip portrays the tipsy Box as prey being stalked by the men she encounters. When one of the men seen in the clip complained bitterly about his portrayal as a would-be rapist, one of the video’s creators sent a private Facebook message advising him to, “Just go with it dude, you are in our team now and we will take care of you.” The men shown in the video--each of whom is seen trying to lure Box (seen above) to their residence or vehicle--were recruited by Zhang and sidekick Seth Leach, who, days before the video was shot, wrote on his Facebook page that he was, “Shooting some videos in LA all day Thursday and need a good actress. If you live in Los Angeles or have a friend who does and is an actress, tag them/hit me up!” http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documen...x-video-785463 tl;dr: video of men trying to rape a drunk woman goes viral, men involved get threats/lose friends, ends up being the case that the entire video was scripted So anyway, I'm glad we've come to this point as a society. To discuss the prevalence of misogyny and supposed rape culture, we're now manufacturing examples of rapists in their natural habitats: crowded city streets with cameras pointed directly at them.
