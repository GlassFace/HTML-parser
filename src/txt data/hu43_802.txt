 Searching for anime recommendations
 I wasn't sure where to post this and I am sorry if I posted in the wrong section. Anyway, like the title reads, I am searching for new anime to watch. Some of my favorite anime series are Black Butler, Baka and Test, Ouran High School Host Club, and Minami Ke. I am looking for anime that is similar to the ones I mentioned. 
 I would recomend Inu X Boku SS. It is about a bunch of very eccentric people with supernatural powers living in an apartment complex called Ayakashi Kan. It focuses on the new tenant Ririchiyo Shirakiin and her endeavors in adjusting to her new life at Ayakashi. Oh and by the way, all the tenants have Secret Service body guards to protect them from any danger that may befall them. It's a slice of life romantic comedy, and I think you would like it.
