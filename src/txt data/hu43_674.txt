 PBS and Qubo
 I recently lost cable and had to switch over to antenna television. Since I'm stuck with it I've been watching some of the shows on PBS and the Qubo channel lately. While sickeningly cute and educational, some of them are actually fairly entertaining. What shows on these channels (besides Dr. Who) do you watch if any?
