[Personal Life Discussions] Your Friends who watch anime
 Doing anything takes skill. Had a high school friend who watcheda certain adult anime. We talked about it while on our way to play tennis. I thought it was pretty funny. Old anime was one. Took me 40+ episodes to get used to. Wouldn't say I like the art, but I'll never regret watching .hack//sign. And I played .hack//Link (the last game where every main character comes in to form a story.) And Silver Knight has an obsessive love for Subaru in the Cross Rengeki in //Link. 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
