[General Discussion] Body Modification
 Tattoos and piercings I can see, but I don't really get anything else. Unless it's reconstructive, Any girl who gets plastic surgery is ugly by default to me, no matter how they actually look. To me, outside fakeness translates to inside fakeness. As for Transgender surgery, I don't really get it. Why would you ever want to change genders? I'm not gonna judge since some people feel that they're trapped in the body of a boy/girl, and want to get right. I'm not one of those people so I wouldn't know how it felt, nor would I want to know It's not on me to judge you Would I ever get with a girl who has had trans-surgery? I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. With the bizarre mods, I just say no. Just no. I try not to judge, but these are cases where it's really hard not to. You've crossed the line of weirdness in my mind if you start tattooing the eyes or the whole body, or start getting your tongue forked, or your whole body changed to a different color. When you hit the point of trying to emulate an animal or become a vampire or weird-ass stuff like that, I just..... just stay away from me please. Do as you please, but if I can't look at you like I would any other person, do as you please away from me...........or I'll most likely stay away from you
