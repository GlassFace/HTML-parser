 Ferguson, MO; Declined indictment of Darren Wilson
 ST. LOUIS  A grand jury has declined to indict Darren Wilson, the white Ferguson, Mo. police officer whose fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager sparked days of turbulent protests and a national conversation about race and police interactions with African Americans, prosecutors said Monday. The decision means that Wilson, 28, will face no state charges in the August shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Although a parallel federal civil rights investigation of the shooting is continuing, federal investigators have all but concluded they do not have a case against Wilson, either, law enforcement officials have said. http://www.washingtonpost.com/politi...340_story.html I'm very happy with this decision. The right call was made though all the mess that the media caused.
