 Nintendo 2DS, wat
 It sounds like a joke the first time you hear about it. It's the sort of thing you'd come up with during a late night at a bar while suggesting ridiculous video game console ideas. Rest assured, though, the newly announced Nintendo 2DS is a real console that works just like the current Nintendo 3DS, just without the system's defining glasses-free 3D capabilities. Why get rid of the primary feature that set the 3DS apart from its portable and mobile gaming brethren? One likely reason is cost. The new system will retail for $129.99 when it launches in North America on October 12. That's $40 less than the basic 3DS and $70 less than the 3DS XL (and the newly reduced PlayStation Vita as well). http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/08/no-joke-new-nintendo-2ds-plays-your-3ds-games-in-2d/ Essentially they are getting rid of the 3D effect, mono instead of stereo speakers, and the hinged design to lower the product cost. Seems like they're preparing for the fall and winter game launches. Supposedly this new design uses a single screen that is effectively masked by the case, Which would explain the move away from a hinged design: http://www.usgamer.net/articles/oh-s...ndos-next-move 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 Just give me a 2DS XL. Then I'll buy one.

 Haha just make it a single usable screen in that case and drop the dumb DS moniker, Nintendo. You created a gaming-centric tablet. Do a better job branding it now. 

 Looks like the controller for the Wii U. C'mon Nintendo, you aren't some sleazy Greeks or Frenchfags here.

 Its meant as an entry level gaming device for younger kids. Its shaped like a piece of cake and is meant to be a much more affordable for cheaper lower income families.

 Maybe this is a bad reason; but the only thing I hate about it is that IT DOESN'T ****ING FOLD.

 Ill be the only one to support it and say Ill buy one. For no other reason than to disagree with everybody in here. ILL STAND ALONE!!!!! The biggest downside I will admit to this is its bulk. Im so use to being able to fold my DS, that I might forget it doesn't fold and end up breaking the thing in half. >_<

Mary Fallen says, "B*tch stole my DS" OT: That thing looks and sounds so stupid I wouldn't even accept it for free unless I can sell it for like $10 to $20 bucks, $20 might be asking for too much on that POS. Hey parents, turn the #D-function switch on the side of the 3DS "Off". I am keeping my 3DS-XL and my only curiosity is how many pricks would buy this, even for their clones?

 I definitely agree with Ian on this one. It would look much better with a single touchscreen, even if gameplay would split the screen with a bar or something. The lack of foldability seems like it would make the system a hassle to carry around in one's pocket, but I think it would be more worth it if the system were $99.99 instead. Also, I do not know why people say it looks like a slice of cake. Clearly it looks more like a slice of bread.

 Looks pretty sensible to me design-wise for kids , removal of the dreaded 3d will help to sell it to the parents of kids as well. I'd buy it for my kid. 

 Im not fully on the 2DS side but...I do own a 3DS and I dont like the 3D on so I locked it (which is something anyone can do). The 2DS to me was meant for kids 7 and below...its almost flat and doesnt fold (which is good because some kids break the hinges like my cousin broke his when he dropped it) also the price isnt bad too. $129.99 i think...it has it's pro and cons but anyway its nintendo im on their 3D side and not their 2D.

 I haven't brought any of the new DS's but the top screen on this one is larger than the bottom screen, isn't that new? I still think the best Gameboy was the Gameboy Color. The SP was just stupid.

Anyway, although this reeks of 'cheeseburger without cheese' the price drop will shift a few units and it will have a bigger market for its 2d games library. Size is do-able and besides, its gonna look larger in a childs hand anyway. Still......Tendo really needs to concentrate on the Wii U. Talk about dropping the ball. Talking of which, this has got to be the most drop resistant handheld out there!

 Since it's meant as an entry-level device for children who aren't old enough for the 3D anyway, and they break the hinges like no tomorrow, it seems effective at its intended job. I wouldn't purchase it, but I already own a 3DS and I'm not a child. For low income families, it's also great since it's cheaper and more likely to last through being dropped and roughed up. I'd buy it for my child. 
 HONK :O) 
 Why would they make it so it can't close? I don't see the point.
