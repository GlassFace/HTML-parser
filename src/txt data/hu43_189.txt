 Linux users...
 Are there many linux users out there. At the moment my OS is Linux Ubuntu 10.04. Its working out great for me, its fast and customizable, but on the down side it cant run .exe files at ease. To make it easier i used their simple dual booting system, where all i had to do is use their simple installer. Comment your OS and story behind it?
