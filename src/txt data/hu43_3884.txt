 Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate
 Hey guys, anyone excited for Monster Hunter 4? Not being a person whose played the previous monster hunters besides one for the wii i'm looking forward to this a great deal. The gameplay and art look amazing not to mention the newly added online feature. The game also features the use of the new buttons on the new 3ds console which possible adds more control and ability. What do you guys think? I'd also love to get 3ds friend codes from those of you who are thinking about getting it. Monster hunter 4 will be released for 3DS on: Japan - October 11, 2014 North America - February 13, 2015 Europe - February 13, 2015 Australia - February 13, 2015 Source: http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/...ter_4_Ultimate For more information I'd check out: https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nin....html#Overview
