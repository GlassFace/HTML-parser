[Anime] Spice and Wolf (Song)
 Started Spice and Wolf yesterday, I wanna say the end song is the best ever! I've never heard one like it in any anime I've seen. 

 Spice and Wolf ending credits is really catchy too bad they changed it in season 2 
 I also wish they made a S3... i really loved the songs 
Watch It!!! Or I'll Take Your Soul 
 I just finished season 1, debating on season 2 i watched a review on it, But I didn't like the noblemen's character...trying to buy Holo so basically I won't watch it because i don't want Holo and Lawrence to be separated.
