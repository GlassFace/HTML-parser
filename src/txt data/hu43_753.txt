 Soul Cry Redone
 36; The Puppeteer (Part 2)  Spoiler I can hear what is going on around me, even if I am in this world of my own creation. Jenny has taken off while Erin and Tom are talking strategy about Eve, they have yet to mention Rane, and I wish I could tell them. The sky is so beautiful here, like my world was before everything happened…I am not sure when my skies started turning black, was it when I moved with my Uncle. No probably not, but before that, when the few friends I had at my school turned their backs on me? Or farther back still, when my mother died and my father lied, leaving me in the caring hand of my ailing grandmother. But with this time to think, I have drowned out the screams and talking banter from Tom, Erin, and my friend, I need this time to figure out how to escape this world. Is this an illusion of my own if I think depression thoughts, if I witness Paul’s death again, can I escape? I need to help everyone, but how? The calm wind picks up into a hurricane. Standing I try to keep my hair out of my eyes with one hand while the other holds my skirt down. My eyes widening as the sky does turn black but for other reasons than clouds, no a hand is casting a giant shadow upon my world and I. “Naomi, forgive me but I must interfere less everyone here dies.” That voice, I recognize it, and I hear Erin and Tom commenting, “What do you mean interfering?” Erin spouts. “Who the hell are you,” Tom yells, “What are you about to do to her?” “You’re going to be in intense pain upon awakening, just focus on recalling your persona, the Black Rock that you are.” My ears begin to ring as the world around me vanishes in an instant and in that same instant I am back in my body, but my eyes are wide and my mouth is open in a silent scream. My arm, my left arm is gone and it hurts so much. I try reaching my other arm for it as Marie bends down in front of me, placing a metal handed glove over the stub where my arm once was, another gong goes off as my eyes ring once again. Marie then stands and backs away, “I can do no more for you.” Tears streaming down my face as I struggle with the pain, as I struggle with doing as I was told, with calling forth my persona. “Naomi, you are stronger than you believe, stop letting your thoughts control you, use your instincts.” Erin yells at me with encouragement and that seems to dampen the pain ever so slightly. “Wish you would send some of those sentimental words my way,” Tom comment quietly as I begin to sit myself up while still trembling and trying hard not to black out again. Soon sweat begins falling and my eyes dry up as I begin panting, calming myself while looking at Erin. Marie has simultaneously vanished, while Tom remains in the corner, a few new bruises I am guessing from when he tried facing Eve again who is after Jenny right now. I hear them going after each other and Jenny sounds like she’s at deaths door with each rumbling that echoes though the broken door behind us. Now gritting my teeth I look to my missing arm, trying with all my might to call upon my Black Rock, I was for but a moment in peace before Rane entered my mind, but I have to do something, I have to save my friends, everyone has fought not except for me. Erin saved me—tried to at least. Tom he protected me while I was out and now Jenny is doing the same as if I am their last hope. Marie showing up was proof enough for that. “Naomi…” Erin and Tom ask me as the blood that was dripping from the cauterized wound that Marie patched for me begins forming a new arm, a deep black metal like claw like when I was against my brother—rest his soul. My eyes begin burning a green flame and my arms burst into green flames before fully forming the claw that I had previously. Then my new persona dawns upon me as I stand, facing both my friends here. “Wish me luck.” They nod, awe stuck at my sudden confidence and appearance, I just lost an arm, but this metal one feels as if I had always had it, right here. I am not sure how I will fight Eve and Rane but I have to get Jenny out of harm’s way. Walking outside the room, the halls are patched with slashes and dents, and down the why both Jenny and I came I watch as she’s forced against the wall, her own persona barely holding up to Eve’s relentless attacks. As Eve comes charging at my friend in her hovering wheelchair I take on a deep stance, bending my legs down as far as they will allow. Then, like a spring I soar in front of Jenny and bring my metal arm up, reflecting Eve’s blades into the ceiling and sliding to a stop moments before hitting the wall. “Jenny, find Rane now!” I yell at her as she too is just as awe stuck as Tom and Erin before her. “I feel like I am me, my mother’s thoughts aren’t within me and my persona, this is who I am.” Eve does not pause, laughing as she comes at me and I open both my hands towards the ground, green fire setting them a blaze as chains fall out of them. “Naomi?” Jenny calls for me and I glare at her. She knows what I am asking and she needs to find her quickly. She out of everyone here knows me the best. She senses the strain in my voice as Eve comes at me and I stop her, sending my chairs into the wheels of her chair, at the same time sprouting more from my hands and stopping the three blades that continually spin in front of her. But she’s hesitating, this is her first true fight, she must be tired. Her movements are cumbersome and I sigh, I cannot be mad with her, she is only starting she’s done good dodging Eve thus far. “If we can just hold Eve off, we can stop Rane, Rane is controlling her! She believes we are her toys and she wants to have fun, let’s put on a good show!” I constrict the chains tighter and Eve’s wheelchair and sawblades shatter while she drops to the ground. Jenny taking too long to comprehend the situation I grab her arms and we take off down the hall. As we run past the open doorway that Tom and Erin still reside in, I yell at Tom, “Hold of Eve if she comes after us, we need to find Rane.” I see Erin is already trying to move himself, I know how he is feeling, he is feeling useless like I felt so many times before, “Erin, please just remain here.” I hate to tell him that but what can he do in this situation? We have two insane girls after us, well one under the control of another but two none the less. Not making the situation better I feel both Jenny and I weightless as we go crashing though wall after wall, a ghostly figure forcing us though the hospital and into an open area within the center of the hospital, surround on all sides by buildings we being falling three stories down to the ground as that ghostly figure stops just short of the hole he have fallen from. I begin wrapping myself like a cocoons in my chains, till we land and I am with in the green flames and chains that surround me, outside, I feel her presents, Rane’s, it’s as if that ghost was bring us here. Within this casing, Jenny lies unconscious near my feet. “Perhaps I gave myself a way to quickly, though thanks to your mother, you got here quickly, I wanted to play with you personally Naomi, see if you are as good of a play thing as Marisa was…she broke to easily though.” I allow a sliver of light to open in within my fortress of chains so as to see her, and for her to see me. Her hair, long like mine, her eyes, green, she’s a black rock, I can feel is, and her ability is to control others, but she’s decked out in more armor than I, her breast plate, black as the night around her, her legs, on wheels much like her sisters, but her hands, both outstretched and her fingers twitching, she’s must be moving my mother or her own sister right now. “I understand what you are thinking, but no I am not controlling Marisa, you see she is too powerful for even me to control, I can merely keep her at bay, but more so than you as you were caught up in her attack. But you can thank me for releasing you, if I hadn’t removed your arm, you wouldn’t be putting up this kind of a fight. I don’t want a used play toy, I like mine new, and you are new.” She begins laughing and I grit my teeth, closing the little sliver I had open to see if I could speak with her what so ever, but she is psychotic, what made her this way. Jenny begins stirring at my feet, while trying to keep my guard up I sink down to her and see just how badly she has been beaten up. A black eye, her lips busted and her persona which I always found so cute is shredded due to Eve’s attacks, she is decent at least but I can tell she has been through hell while trying to hold Eve off. “Play with me Naomi!” I hear Rane yell outside and Eve falls though the multitude of chains I had barricaded us within, her face smiling and her eyes glowing, laughing all the same, her hand reaching forward trying to grab at me. But it’s her eyes that widen and she is sucked out and I recall all the chains around me, while at the same time having two snick under the ground and to Rane who screams as she too is hulled up into the air, both of them now next to each other in the air, I send chains to entrap both of their arms. Both of them restrained, Eve is continuously laughing while struggling while Rane has a furious look in her eyes, “is this how you play with your toys?” She screams, trying to get loose from the chains I place her in when Jenny speaks up, “Naomi, look out!” Her voice is weak but I hear her and turn as the ghostly figure darts at me. She is my mother, she is a soul Husk, her mouth opens glowing pink and soon she lets out a deathly scream, jarring all my senses, I try to keep from zoning out but that comes anyway, that scream has so much despair. In the brief state of confusion I am in, I remember Uncle Mike telling me that by figure out what they become as a Soul Husk, that will lead us to what we should do, the only think I can think of to describe my mother, is a Banshee. She is so sad. Gaining control before we leave the area I open my mouth and my eyes as wide as I can, screaming just like she did at me, the green flames escaping my eyes and even mouth as the darkness that sounds my others faces fades ever so slightly, and I see her face, I see my mother. 2,006 Words 2,680 Words So Far Well, I was thinking I would talk about how Rane's back story was, but I seem to have falling right into a battle scene...well I'll to explain later. Stay tuned. That last paragraph I am reminded of Ghost Rider.
