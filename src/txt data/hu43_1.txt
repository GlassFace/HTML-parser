 Courtney Love is planning on suing Activision
 Tbh, at first I was all right "OMGLOL? Wtf? Courtney Love is so stupid!" But then I started reading a bit (there's quite a few gaming news outlet's that has covered this by now) and I realised that maybe she has a point. After all, Kurt Cobain was against the over-commercialisation of music. To have an avatar of him standing around and singing Blink182 _is_ kind of like pissing on his grave. I'm with Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic on this one (the two surviving members of Nirvana), disable the option to unlock him - but keep him in the game. I wasn't going to buy GH earlier (because I think the entire franchise has gone into the drain when harmonix left it), but I'm certainly not going to buy it now. Kurt Cobain was a great man who wrote music that meant something and had strong opinions about how boring and useless mainstream music had become. To show him off this way is not respectful, even if Courtney Love in all of her drug-hazed stupidity signed off on it without realising it. Activision really has nothing to win by keeping Kurt as an unlockable character. If Courtney are right, then they are breaking their contract. If Courtney actually did sign off on this without realising it, they look like douchebags by still keeping him in the game with the "but we've got a paper"-excuse.
