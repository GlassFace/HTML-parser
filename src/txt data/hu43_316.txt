I approve of this message, since I started to just focus on game, not blame anyone and kept cool to everyone in the team, help them get a hold of their lanes, I've been getting almost no reports, except some... Negative Attitude for helping the team? What, what ever, but yeah, I think they have that kind of secret system, because I've been getting nice players and when I'd only rage a little and get reported, I'd get the trolls non-stop for the day. 
A calm . mind is the key to success.
 Or you could just legitimately have bad luck in Ranked.

 I usually get first blood. But when i give it, i know how to handle the lane. Dun fight them, just farm at my turret and enjoy as i reap the gold. :3 On another note, there is too much snowballing in the lane phase. A death or two in a lane is difficult. But then afterwards, if also a bad match up, the lane is dead. Too easy to lose and win lane. Its so explosive on the first death, as people just hop on doran items and dominate lane until the gold can be transferred to better items.

 Ladder wins is all about losing lanes gracefully. The really one sided games I get are usually because a lane gets down in CS/Kills but rather than take the hit and slowplay they just start all-ining. I would actually argue losing a lane you should lose (because of ganks, counterpick, etc) without feeding is harder to do than just winning a lane.

 So Ahri needs a kit rework and some numbers tuning, but Fizz gets just a number tweaked AND a bugfix that makes him even MORE ridiculous? What? What is this horrible injustice? "Let's slaugther Ahri and slather her blood on the walls of Riot HQ as a warning to balanced champions who become popular. Oh, Fizz? We're gonna leave Fizz alone." - Riot

Where as my account that's NEVER been warned has the worst teams ever. What I said only counts for people that somewhat understand the game and work to improve their skill. Sorry. if you are bad you will lose no matter what.

SHE IS LIKE ASSASSIN PLAYMAKER + CARRY MACHINE. TOO MUCH JUNK IN THAT TRUNK. Kassadin is all of these things and more, and he got buffed with this patch. Fizz is every bit as mobile, every bit as assassin-y and every bit as safe, and he got a minor tap on an irrelevant part of his kit. Zed is the same. But Ahri gets gutted and hung from a tree by her own intestines while these three are left virtually untouched despite the fact that they hold higher ban rates than her as well as higher win ratios. I don't understand Riot Live Design and never will. They have no sense or concept of justice when it comes to balancing this game. Hell, I don't think that Riot Live Design understands Riot Live Design. Everything they touch turns to ash at their fingertips. Jayce, Olaf, Eve, Hecarim, Kha' Zix, Ryze, Twisted Fate, Xin Zhao, Zac. These were all good, viable champions at one point in time until this group of f*ck ups decided they needed work. The list of champions that they're nerfed into oblivion far outweighs the list of champions they've helped thrive, if such a list even exists. These people even refuse to defend their decisions on their own f*cking forums. You'd think they'd be present when the patch notes are released to you know, clarify things and explain themselves, but they're nowhere to be found, probably on purpose, because they understand full well that they are intensely disliked by the vast majority of the community.

 I'm not reading the Kassadin changes as a buff. They look more like a redirection of power, with more emphasis on his riskiest move. General Magic Resist per level reduced to 0 (from 1.25) Null Sphere Base damage reduced to 80/115/150/185/220 (from 80/130/180/230/280) Silence duration changed to 1.5/1.75/2.0/2.25/2.5 seconds (from 1/1.4/1.8/2.2/2.6) Mana Cost reduced to 70/75/80/85/90 (from 70/80/90/100/110) Riftwalk Base damage increased to 80/100/120 (from 60/70/80) Base damage per Riftwalk stack reduced to 50/55/60 (from 60/70/80) Added 0.1 Ability Power ratio per stack Now refunds 50% of the total mana cost when Riftwalk damages an enemy champion Now, to be fair, Ahri is far too powerful at the moment. Too much of her damage is essentially free and requires little skill to apply. Forcing her to achieve some kind of combo or to chain her abilities intelligently seems like a reasonable thing to do. 

 Ahri needed a nerf... Fizz's damage isn't the problem imo... it's his invincibility... but that's what makes him, I guess...

Forcing her to achieve some kind of combo or to chain her abilities intelligently seems like a reasonable thing to do. ROFL@ fair. If we were being "fair" here, Fizz, Kass, and Zed would have been similarly gutted, but they weren't. I don't understand how you think "fair" is the proper word to use in this situation. Also, what qualifies as "free" damage? Is "free" damage usually dependent on DFG like Ahri's W and R? Or is it just tacked on to the end of utility abilities like Kassadin's R, Fizz's E, or Zed's W? Similarly, what does "little skill to apply" mean? When I hear "little skill to apply" I think targeted abilities like Ryze and Annie Q, not abilities like Fox-Fire where the slightest bit of improper positioning means that one or two fires hit unintended targets and your opponent gets away or worse, kills you. --- ROFL Aatrox and Ahri have been disabled due to a new bug introduced with this patch... Like I said, incompetence is the only thing you can expect from these people.

 You might be a little too opinionated about Ahri to appreciate how OP she is compared to most champs, Ixi. She really does do anything you could want from an AP mid with no real weaknesses to be exploited. I appreciate that she's your favorite champ and it def sucks when they get attention from Riot for nerfs, but they're not unwarranted. She's too good at everything.
