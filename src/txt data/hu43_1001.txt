[Comedy] Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko.
 Youto Yokodera is always thinking about his carnal desires, but no one acknowledges him as a pervert. He learns about a cat statue that supposedly grants wishes. The boy goes to pray that he will be able to express his lustful thoughts whenever and wherever he wants. At the statue, Youto encounters Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi, a girl from his high school with her own wishthat she would not display her real intentions so readily. This could go heads or tails for me, I really wonder how it's going to be. Only raw is out thought, I'll reply after I've seen the first subbed. First episode was pretty epic, if it continues like this I think I will like this anime.

 I dropped the manga a while ago. At the start, its quite cool, the power of the cat statue and stuff was new to me, but yeah, for me it was slacking off. Still going to watch this, since it could just be that the manga took more time for the character development than the anime, which was one of the reasons I dropped it 
 So i just saw the first episode, pretty funny. The base of the story build-ed up in one episode, i think i will be following this. 
 Dubstep Chaos Theory - ShockOne l Siren - Kat Krazy ft Elkka l Faith - BlasterJaxx 
 I think this anime is pretty cool. I'll be keeping an eye on this. ^^ 
 If you ever fall in love with another girl.. I wouldn't be able to live on! 
 Just finished the first episode. Gotta say this Anime definitely has some potential. Pretty decent story line and a lot of comedy so far. See how far it can go 

 The first episode was pretty good and funny. Looking forward to the next; hope it will be just as good if not better. 

 the art in the manga was one of the best ive seen although i thought the story did lack something im just about to watch the first episode so yeah, will share my thoughts later 
 I'll have to take a look at the manga if the art work is good. 

 Seems interesting enough, someone of the forums recommended me to this so I plan to atleast give it a try. ;3

 The second episode was pretty sad at times but I still feel its just getting better. Looking forward to the next! 

 So good.... <3

 I like it I thought it was funny and the opening is really good 
 I guess he got his Facade back instantly...I dont know how I feel about that.

Someone around him will most likely lose their facade as well seeing as he got his back so quickly or he'll just spend his time trying to get Tsukiko's back, but it's good that they didn't drag it out to the point where it was unbearable. Even though I am kinda worried about this love triangle that's starting to form.

Even though I am kinda worried about this love triangle that's starting to form. I'm hoping for a love Square and they involve Tsukushi some how. But it seems it will probably end up being a Triangle.

 With most love triangles I have a favorite, but as of now I am with both girls. This show is great, I just hope it continues being great. I hear the manga gets dull after a bit so I hope they stop the anime before that or spruce it up to make it better.

I hear the manga gets dull after a bit so I hope they stop the anime before that or spruce it up to make it better. I feel the same way. Both girls are pretty cool characters. Btw your signature, I cannot stop laughing at it. 

 So Episode 4 was interesting to say the least. Tsukushi took a character turn with wanting to marry Her sister and move to Massachusetts. I was not to fond of that. The ending was pretty crazy though, so I am looking forward to what will happen next. 

 Tsukushi's character has taken a complete 180 change. I really do not like her anymore, along with the blonde girl. This episode kinda sucked. There were parts that were funny, but I feel like I could have done with out watching that episode. I hope they have a strong episode 6. 

 ^ I actually loved the episode, plus the sister seems less threatening now. Actually kind of funny they when with there are two of them like twins. The joke is kind of being pushed which in a negative.

 Less threatening? What are you talking about? The sister is still scary as heck! T_T Kowai!!

 This was one of the reasons why I did not like this episode...they got really Crazy with the sisters eyes.  Spoiler 

 Yah, the eyes kind of freaked me out but that's no reason to say the episode was bad.

 Well they definitely came back with a stronger episode. I thought it was really funny, and the end was pretty serious.
