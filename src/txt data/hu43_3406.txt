 The Big 3 Manga (Is is worth it?)
 Originally Posted by Canned YumYum I've watched through the original Naruto only and not through Shippuuden, so I can't comment much on it. I haven't seen Bleach at all.

Since you said you were half through with it, what did you think of it up until this point and on what arc are you currently? Do you have specific questions? I'm on the fishman island arc where they meet a bunch of mermaids and stuff. The specific episode is episode 389 I think. I think I'm going to wait for the dub though since they are close to catching up with me and I really enjoy the dub. I just want to know if it's fun to read the manga and watch the anime.
