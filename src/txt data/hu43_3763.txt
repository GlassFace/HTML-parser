 Kon'nichiwa Mina !
 Kon'nichiwa mina !! Benjamin here. I've been into anime and manga since was 7, and it feels really good to be here at this forum amongst people who don't just follow but also appreciate how awesome anime are. I love anything out of the intense warfare, historical dramas and shonen stack of genres. I'm more into manga but I also do follow the anime version of the series. My top picks in manga are : One Piece (grew up with it) , Kingdom ( love the intense warfare) , Feng Shen Ji , Tokyo Ghoul , Attack on Titan, Akame ga Kill and Beelzebub. Among the anime series, I follow one piece , tokyo ghoul , attack on titans , akame ga kill , DBZ and Bleach. I'm a huge sucker for Miyazaki films, and my all time favorite anime movies are Ghost in the Shell, My Neighbor Totoro and Wolf Children.
