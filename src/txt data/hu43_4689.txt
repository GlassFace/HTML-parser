 the price of evil...
 HI. I'm Star-Blazer its nice to be here, I hope to participate for a real long time! Well I'm just some boring guy with nothing interesting to say...ever. I live in Canada and been enjoying anime for a long time. My favorite character is Goku and my fave # is 8. The last anime I watched was Lucky Girl. Btw I'm using a shitty tablet to post here...so bare with me. (I miss my laptop) My god given talent is art and story telling. I would like to write a book someday or get my comic published. So yeh... Well I'll see you guys around the forum. Feel free to send me friend requests.
