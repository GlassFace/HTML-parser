[Comedy] Yoru no Yatterman
 The Yoru no Yatterman project is confirmed to be a 12-episode winter 2015 TV series celebrating the 40th anniversary of Tatsunoko's Time Bokan series. Along with this is a new visual featuring the modernized designs for Doronbo Gang henchmen Boyacky and Tonzura, working with the beautiful Doronjo to cause problems for heroes-to-be Gan-chan and Ai-chan. The young staff from Muromi-san plans to update the classic mecha-superhero comedy in a manner similar to Gatchaman Crowds. Plot: A girl is looking at a remote island on the ocean named The Yatter Kingdom, a country that is said to be ruled by the hero Yatterman. The girl wants to ask the Yattermans for some help to cure her sick mother and decides to venture to the kingdom. She gets kicked out from the kingdom though and her mother dies without receiving any help. Under Dokurobei, the boss of the Dorombo thieves that existed, lies a beauty named Doronjo. The two men, Boyacky and Tonzura, worked under Doronjo but got kicked out from the Yatter Kingdom along with the Doronbo thieves as they lost a fight against the Yatterman. This is the new generation of DoromboDoronjo, Boyacky, Tonzura, and new Yattermana story of the birth of Gan-chan and Ai-chan.

 Just finished ep 1. It was very sad but good. I have high expectations for this series. It seems like it's going to be funny, emotional, and have some good action 
 I feel like I'm watching a show about Team Rocket if they were decent villains. I'm not sure if I should take this show seriously but I feel I must because of the subject... Either way it's great and I'm going to continue watching it.
