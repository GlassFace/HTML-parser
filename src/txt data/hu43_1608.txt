[Adventure] Pokemon Origins
 This OVA is awesome, Red caught all of pokemon and won the Pokemon League, this is just kinda like Pokemon Fire red version, Finally I can see Red and not some loser Asshat Ketchum or whatever his name who doesn't even win and lost to the lamest character Cameron...and His pikachu is like resetting and lost to a lvl 5 Snivy.
