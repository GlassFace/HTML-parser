 I was just thinking about a system like that earlier when I was playing ranked. I don't know i guess it's a good thing because people wont be *****ing about not getting their role. but there is an advantage to working out with your team and being able switch etc.

Normally I wouldn't care, but every post you make that I facepalm on brings the question back into my head.....which just happens to be everthing you post period.

 What is the point in posting wins... everyone gets them, and win streak posts are just bragging. I only show my worst loses.

Well this happened, depressing day -  Spoiler -Guess i can't carry -I gave EVERY lane a huge advantage, didn't workout -1 Afk at start, Second after like 10 mins -team adc vs team tank -friend 3 leagues above me flattened me in 1v1 -oh wait i won one that day

 I can definitely see the drawback to that system. Everyone is going to put on their tryhard pants and the meta is going to be enforced like crazy playing one of the only 3 champs that are considered op. Plus usually draft picks go well...most of the time. http://gyazo.com/c85a4703ca1e92ecf8d66d8b45308ff0 had to make this 
 That was ****in derp alright...

 Just played versus Gaming Gear EU's jungler. Did a nice 1v1, I know top laners are usually stronger than junglers but he had a good 3-4 kills on me.

 Well, I said I'd walk, but I'm apparently on a nine game winning streak in ranked for some reason.

  Spoiler Well, the teams I've been getting recently aren't has much stupid as usual, I mean, sure I get them from time to time and I have to carry them, but in the recent days I've been getting decent people, barely got any flaming! Probably one or two flamers, what are the odds! I've also realised something, if I'm doing horrible, my entire team tends to do the same, what ever my position is. I'm happy with this, except I'm still booze 5, in promotion, I've lost the first one, as you can see, the rest is up to see tomorrow morning, might actually get out of 5, carrying these guys around is NOT fun. I hope season 4 will go better, better than winning 6 games in the placements and getting bronze 1 while my friend won 5 and got silver 5, he always feed, I guess he just had to be there.

 I keep convincing myself I prefer deathblossom Elise... I feel like I'm in the stages of grief, currently at denial... 
 Bueh, both challenger and diamond border looks so ugly.

 I'm pretty torn about the upcoming queue system. On one hand it'll be nice to have considerably less fighting over roles during picks, and the fact that you can specify the strategy you're trying to execute is pretty interesting (Lyte said they were able to use it to queue for a 5 mid strat, which is delightfully insane). There doesn't seem to be any reason for the traditional meta to be locked unless that's what you want to play. I love the idea of being able to play the role I want to play rather than working through the awful pick/ban situation we're in now. On the other hand some measure of the game's spontaneity will be gone. If your team decides to change up the strategy while in the pre-game lobby how accommodating will this new system be? Also, systems like these produce their own special brand of annoyance. Anyone who's queued up in WoW's dungeon finder knows what I'm talking about, selecting a certain role places an enormous amount of expectation on your ability to play that role well. I worry that if you queue up to be a jungler in this new system and have a bad game the flak you get will be intensified because you queued up specifically to do that role and you should be amazing at it. Overall, I like the idea. I'm just worried about the new problems it'll introduce.

Overall, I like the idea. I'm just worried about the new problems it'll introduce. Yes, but is that any different than calling or requesting a role in any other lobby? Assuming no one argues with you, and demands your requested role for themselves, there's not much of a difference that I can think of. If you call or request a role, you're expected to play it well. You're pretty much always expected to perform well, but if you're just filling because you have no other choice, you're not potentially taking a role away from someone else that thinks they could have done better (if they actually wanted to play your role, but let you since you called it or just took it because you had pick order on your side). As for teams possibly wanting to change what they want to do after getting into the lobby, I don't see why they couldn't select whatever setups they wanted and then play roles that they didn't queue into after getting into the game -- say a jungler and adc wanted to switch roles in the lobby for whatever reason, I don't see why the jungler couldn't choose an adc and the necessary runes/masteries, with the adc doing the same but with a jungler, and then playing those new roles after getting into the game. The new system is just to aid in queuing for the role you want for the most part, but it doesn't seem to restrict you from playing a different role after getting into the lobby/game should you need to for whatever reason. I'm really looking forward to it. I don't even care if it forever remains its own queue, and is never integrated into ranked (or given its own ranked queue). Just being able to play what I want when I want is enough for me.

 ^ The difference is in WoW noobs queue as tank then they are a dps/healer and have no tank talents or gear... This is a system I've wanted for a long time, but the practical system would never be as good as you want it to, there are always flaws.

 It seems that I can't stop winning. :/ I love Ahri and all, but I honestly think ADC is what I'm best at.
