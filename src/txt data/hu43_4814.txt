[Manga] Ubel Blatt (Evil Blade)
 Who's heard of this? I'm halfway through what's been released so far. It really reminds me a lot of those hours I spent reading the "A Song of Ice and Fire" series due to its High Fantasy themes but explicit, mature content. Let the Shota flow through this awesome, provocative manga. The violence is superb, the depressing and dark themes are done not too harshly although the sexual service can be gritty or gratuitous almost all the time. The Anti-Hero and betrayal plotline is really compelling, it's dramatic enough to hook you in to the MC and his followers. 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils? Join Super-Powered and get in on the action! Â Spoiler http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...-Super-Powered
