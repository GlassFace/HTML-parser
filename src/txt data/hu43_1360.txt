 My Bride is a Mermaid
 Series: Seto no Hanayome (My Bride is a Mermaid) Release date: 2007 Genre: Romantic Comedy, Harem, Fantasy Director: Seiji Kishi Writer: (?) Creator: Tahiko Kimura Number of Episodes: 26 Overview: A teenager named Nagasumi Michishio is saved from drowning by a beautiful mermaid known as Sun Seto, daughter of Gozaburo, head of a mermaid mafia. Under mermaid law, either the mermaid or the human has to be executed due to the mermaid's identity being revealed. To save both of the teens, unfortunately for Gozaburo, their families agree to get the two married. My opinion: What I like about the plot is it's similarity to the Disney movie, The Little Mermaid. It is not entirely similar, Seto no Hanayome is more of a crack version. The animation is done well, yet most of the time it's more cartoony because of the many comedic moments. I also think the comedy deserves mentioning, which is very funny and one of the best moments in the show. The music is memorable and will probably stay stuck in your head. It is dubbed by Funimation, which is great as expected by Funimation. My Bride is a Mermaid is a wonderful series filled with many of the funniest moments in anime. 8/10
