 This poor Akali...  Spoiler I think all but one--maybe two--of my kills were on her. I should have just ignored her in fights, because I wasn't getting enough gold for just killing her again and again. Didn't matter in the end, but still... Also, in the chat there you can see their Malphite saying that he had more gold than Akali. He was afk for around 5 minutes (the 15-20 min area), and still managed to get 1.3k more gold than Akali due to his gold items and her dying so much throughout the game--the fact that he actually had a kill and some assists before he left helped too. lol

 http://na.leagueoflegends.com/news/n...aller-revealed I think this is my favorite piece of splash art to date. Just a real stunning portrait! Also a really fun champ, although I feel like they might hit her healing numbers a bit at release or within the weeks following. Only real "complaint" is her E. It's okay I guess, but it feels pretty pointless against most champions given how many escapes, dashes, leaps, and blinks are in the game. Her ult rules, feels like the speed of the wave is 500-600ish so it's pretty hard to dodge unless you've got a lot of room to run. The length of it is kind of insane too, definitely would like to see a return to some of the AoE CC comps to maximize her effectiveness. Mikael's Crucible is such a rad support item. 

 Guess Riot can check off two things people have been asking for with Nami: support and water mage. And it's because of both of those things that she doesn't interest me. Has anyone played much Zed yet? I've only played a few games since he's been released, and out of those I've only seen him once, so I have nothing to gauge his power on aside from one bad jungler using him. I'm nearing 6300 IP again, and I'm wondering if he's worth getting.

 I suggest waiting a week, try him after he is free. I really dont have a opinion on Zed either, I've seen tons of bad Zeds. so I would like to try him out myself before buying him.

 Oh yeah, he's been out a while now, hasn't he? I'll try him when he's free. I tend to waste IP (and RP -_-) too easily. I figured there would be more of him, since he looks kind of cool, visually, and doesn't use mana (I can't be the only one that hates mana, can I?). He must not be too good, or people are just put off by how he seems to be a high skill cap champ and don't bother with him.

He's not too bad, he's good at cleaning up fights because of his passive. His Ult is kinda fun to play around with when you are tower diving. But, I haven't played him that much either.

 Yeah, one thing I have noticed alot is that players dont tend to use his shadow and that he is completely useless in the jungle as he has no real dash or stun. I'm not sure how long his shadow swap range is so I cant really say much yet.

 That's like two champs in a row that people have no idea how to use it seems. Inb4 the next Graves-simple non-support champ is released right after Nami.

 Riot anounced they would stop releasing champs, yet they are still making champs, people havent even mastered Elise yet *I hate her btw* yet they still keep making the game more unbalanced.

 Zed is absurdly strong. The shadow stuff is really amazing as a tool for engaging, disengaging, dodging CC, and bursting the hell out of people. The range on it isn't terribly long, like maybe 600~? Dunno off the top of my head, but you can do shorter dashes to "surround" a champion and burst them with his E and Q from both yourself and the shadows all in like a split second. And if it's someone with a snare or silence or whatever, switching to the shadow can let you dodge about anything. I'm pretty sure he's the top duelist right now, there isn't anyone in the game he should lose to 1v1. He feels even more abusable than Lee Sin when he was bugged. And Elise is a lot of fun, why the hate? ;(

I'm not sure how long his shadow swap range is so I cant really say much yet. It's not to large, It's like 3/4 of Olaf axe to send out, and probably somewhere like and Olaf axe to swap. I tried him jungle, he has the AoE to clear it quickly, but I found he didn't have good gank potential because of the shadow swap range. Ian is right though, you can abuse that shadow to dodge just about everything. Blitz pulls are hillarious to dodge with it. The Untargetable thing about the ult is also fun, turns around a fight pretty quickly.

 Oh, I see I have yet to try him out. his kit is looks pretty cool, I didnt know he was good in 1v1 since I've never really tried to duel one. Cant wait for free week :3 I just hate Elise because I dont think I have ever been able to get a positive score as her, except one time. I'm just used to having more burst right away than having to switch forms to deal increased damage.

I'm just used to having more burst right away than having to switch forms to deal increased damage. Zed is really fun but he is really hard to do positive with as well. I think the best part is changing positions with the shadow when you get ganked. His shadow doesn't move I think so it's hard to land his skills. 
 Yeah he definitely requires a different mindset, you need to regularly make correct snap decisions pretty frequently. But he's very rewarding when you do land your combos. Like, W to surround an enemy, use E to double burst, W to switch places, E again, and finish off with a Q, in a total of like 3-4 seconds. It's devastating. And then you get invulnerable frames with his ult and can use it as a gap closer which is pretty ridiculous to boot. I haven't had a ton of luck with Elise yet either, but I feel like I just need to figure out the best ways of comboing stuff between switching forms. You can definitely get some good burst off, but it's kind of like Jayce where you want to activate a skill then switch up forms and follow up with the other form skills from what I've seen successful players doing.

It's devastating. And then you get invulnerable frames with his ult and can use it as a gap closer which is pretty ridiculous to boot. Hmm I never used the combo like that. I use W q then E. I think your combo is probably more effective not sure since there is a couple of variations. He is one of these champs where using your skills invidiually wont do anything. Like his Q and E don't do any damage, you gotta use them in snych to do any real damage. 
 Yeah, absolutely need to combo stuff for him to do anything useful. If you're just trying to poke with his Qs or using E by itself to clear without the shadow you're missing out on the majority of his damage potential. Although, I do like tossing the shadow out into an incoming mob and using E to apply some damage from safety, then Qing back across it if I'm under tower. He's just got a lot of options and I think the longer he's out, the more his potential is going to shine. 

 I have seen a few nicely played Zed games so far. He is a beast in 1v1 fights if he is used correctly. I have seen alot of players use his shadow swap like a mini flash, for escaping and gap closing. He looks like a pretty fun champ to play honestly. I thought for sure riot would f**k him up but he seems pretty good as is. I havent seen anything op about him.........yet. 
  Spoiler VIDEO GAME: Pokemon Black, Silent Hill 3, Yoshis's Island 2 ANIME:Chaos Head, Heaven's Lost Property, City Hunter, Aquarion Evol MANGA:Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tale, Toriko, One Piece 
 Mastering him is pretty tricky thats why you can't really call him op or anything. He is not a hypercarry either so I think he is pretty balanced so far. We'll see as more people play him but anyone seen pros play zed? 
 Zed has enormous damage potential but his skill ceiling is incredibly high. It's so easy to mess up with him because his quirk, the shadows, are difficult to keep track of when you go into the kill. He's also really only viable in mid with some decent matchups at top. He's incredibly easy to farm with, money should never be a problem, and his pokes are really fun. But when you hit team fights you'll find yourself in a weird spot, like most assassins. Strong in lane, incredibly hard to use any time else.

 So I've been playing on PBE a bit, tried out the new jungle and bruiser top. So much new stuff I dont even know what to get lol, its crazy. The shop is pretty confusing right now but I'll just have to get used to it. So it seems they have given bruisers ALOT more control in teamfights, there are items that give bruisers heavy aoe damage a hit. I like that personally, its not single target anymore, bruisers will be dealing tons of aoe damage. As for the jungling I dont have much to tell yet, except that its kind of retarded that they nerfed madreds and wriggles so much. They barely give any AD and just have a proc to help you jungling. Q.Q quite sad.

 Eh, you can start with the machete now, which is like longsword but you still get your five extra hp pots. I'm thinking people might need to rethink their jungle runes in season 3, more than anything.

I'm thinking people might need to rethink their jungle runes in season 3, there's a lot more itemization possibilities. Yeah, I went Machete on Lee with full attack speed reds to get the best out of Machete. Jungle is just like S1 quite hard, I think I had around 50% hp after a full clear with no pots left. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/...any=true#gid=2 Also this ^ I think its quite accurate.

 Personally I think Zed is probably one of the most fun champs released in a long while. He is tough to play but his kit gives you so much potential to make plays. Also he farms much easier than the majority of the assassin type champions. Riot is releasing 1 more champ after nami which will be the last of the year and apparently the start of the slow down on the champions being made every few weeks. Apparently though the champion after Nami is supposed to be pretty ****in baller. 
 
 I'm relieved to see that Cho'Gath is still going to be viable in the jungle. He has a really unique jungle style; after getting two GP10 items, it is very viable and often a good idea to buy an Oracles. He can do this because of his feast stacks giving him about as much HP as a Giant's Belt at this point, making him really hard to kill. Run up and down river clearing wards and ganking lanes when they're not warded, on top of farming your own jungle whenever Feast is up (as long as you don't have maximum stacks). Really a sick jungler. I've always liked the disruption based junglers but so many of them are going to just blow in the new patch. And Shen jungle is over so I need a new main jungler >_>.
