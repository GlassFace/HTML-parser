 Bento Box

What I want is a god-forsaken taco but the closest Mexican restaurant is a 3 hour, 240km train ride away. Been studying culinary arts, and I can honestly say that some Asian foods are very exotic and fun to create. European food is very traditional heavy, whilst Asian cuisine is more broaden (their differences far exceeds ours anyway). There's a vast amount of Japanese food I can't stand. Natt≈ç for an example, had it when I was in Japan's rural countryside last year. Its taste is worse than its smell!! Korean food too, Kimchi is far from as good as all the K-POP/K-DRAMA lovers wants to believe. It's really sweet and way too sour. Thai food is the best, so many different spices are used, and its so exotic, just like certain Chinese foods. But easily the most attractive has to be the Japanese fish dishes. And watching the way the chefs create their food in the food markets over there, it is really inspirational and it makes you very hungry!
