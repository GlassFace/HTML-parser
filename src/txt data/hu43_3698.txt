 I need a Gundam Recommedation
 As the title says I really would love to get back into the Gundam universe. What I am looking for is a more realistic portrayal (as realistic as you can get with Gundam that is) of the universe. Many people said Zeta Gundam, but for me I just did not like the main character, that and it was just too dated for me to enjoy (I know that's a bad reason but it is one.) I really loved Gundam Wing as a kid mainly because of the villains Trez an Zechs and this is one factor I would like to see take the fore front, the politics instead of just mindless battles. I also really enjoyed the 8th MS team again for its more realistic portal of the Gundams. Looking for something similar in the Gundam universe. I tried Gundam Seed but I think for me it was far to flashy of a Gundam Series. Honestly it doesn't even have to be Gundam either, if you can think of something that describes what I like that is similar feel free to throw it out as well. I have heard Gundam 00 is good, do you guys think this would be in the real of what I am looking for? I am trying to get as much info as I can before I embark on a series.
