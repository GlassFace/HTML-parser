 Fantasy Books
 The Long Earth, The Long War and The Long Mars are 3 separate books written as a collaboration between Pratchett and Baxter. Baxter being a writer of Sci-fi. They are not the best ever, but the premise is great. I have read part of the first book. I need to go back and finish it though when I get some time. Bear in mind that it is Young Adult, or at least, I would label it so. I didn't know that when I bought it as it wasn't in the YA section. Bought it before Mistborn and put it on hold. It's still good though in a twisted, humourous sort of way. Not one to be taken seriously at all. Come on, it has a coca-cola vending machine that used to be a Tibetan Monk and wants to go on an adventure with the protagonist. lol. His consciousness was transferred to the machine as we are told at the beginning. I wouldn't say it's the best ever that I've seen from Pratchett, but I do love his humour. XD. If you remember a TV show called Sliders, it has a bit of that thrown in. They use a sliding machine powered by a potato to "slide" between uninhabited Earths. At least, I think they are uninhabited. That of course is something to discover through reading.
