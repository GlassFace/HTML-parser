 This is a fun show. The swimming pool! The swimsuit crack at the beginning was funny. Also  Spoiler The brother lost because of the positioning between his legs! What a show!  Spoiler and hime being embarrassed when his top came off was cute too - "wait I'm a guy why am I embarrassed?" Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 I forgot about this show until now! I just finished it. Had a weird turn towards the end but otherwise it was a cute little cross dressing school anime. More of a screwball comedy than anything meaningful that is.

 Ironically, I just sent this to two lady friends to watch, Yoda.
