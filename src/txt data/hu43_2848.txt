[Anime] Need a new Anime! :D
 Kerberos, Yea I'm still in secondary school (high school) but only till may next year which is pretty much when i leave Zoltor, some of those animes you suggested, Spice and Wolf, Shakugan no shana, have been suggested sooooo many times by my fellow otaku's lol, I'll be downloading a Sh*t ton of anime over the next couple of months, let's hope I don't have to buy another portable hardrive
