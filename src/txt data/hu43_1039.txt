[General Discussion] Your opinion on A4?
 What is your opinion on A4? Whats the story behind being here, what do you like or dislike about it? Trying not to sound too cheesy, but I was browsing on MAL [myanimelist] and dropping into several anime forums - I have to admit that this is one of the nicest places to be in, I think the only scariest thing I have ever encountered was a small note of 'advice' from the moderators. On other websites, I have to put up with a lot of cyber bullying, harassment and random trash talking because I merely expressed my own opinion - its as if, an individual's opinion is worthless. What I like about A4 is obviously the community, the behaviour and kindness displayed is evident and awesome - most forums aren't like that if you're new and trying to squish in with the flow. What I don't like or moreover - seem to notice the only flaw of A4, is the large amount of closing down threads but this isn't A4's fault and its not something I frown upon - its just there way of keeping the sections clean from spam or very similar posts. 
 
 You love A4 because i'm here? Awww how nice of you. A4 is my first anime forum, not my first forum though, I have used a few, mainly gaming ones though. Runescape forum used to be my favourite years ago and it was my first. But I think A4 mathes its quality from back then, however this is anime based. + My soulmate ProtoBabe lives here. I'm still on this forum after a year, so obviously i'm liking it.

 Might get closed but I'll bite. I enjoy A4 because of the variety of discussion. It's the perfect place for me to learn of a new series or sit back and talk to friends over vm, pm, or irc. I consider A4 more of an intro for me to various anime and when I end up really liking an anime or genre I will go to a forum dedicated to that series or genre, but it usually starts here for me. I've had some of my favorite anime/manga recommended to me from here (here's some recent ones): -Chihayafuru -Fate/Zero -Madoka -Mirai Nikki As for my favorite manga/anime in Hunter x Hunter (would be consistently my favorite if the manga was actually weekly still ) I will never be able to thank Ian and TonyTony enough for getting me onto that a few years back. Epic stuff. -- A4 also helped me raise my quality in posting on a fundamental level. When I joined I was just a dbz club guy and I almost got suspended because most of my posts were **** spam. Despite not having a certain tone of quality when I first joined A4, the mods/members have helped increase quality, etc from me and others as well. -- Anyway, I joined here after getting into dbz and wanting to watch some anime outside of dbz. Since then I've easily seen over 100 series' and even picked up tons of manga which I never really read before joining. -- For the quality thing you mentioned I understand sometimes it sucks but I personally think it's for the best. The other main animeforums domain on the internet is sort of an example of what happens when you don't have diligent staffers and in turn can turn a popular forum into a trashcan.

 I'm glad those of you new here are having a great time, and feel that this site is tolerant, posting free of harassment. Honestly I've been lucky enough to make some really awesome friends from here. I'll keep my comments about the post quality, direction of the forum, and how I feel about the administrative staff to myself so as not to spoil an otherwise perfectly warm and fuzzy post. /kittyface :3

Otherwise we wouldn't stay around, or at least I wouldn't.

 the anime forums is the best forum related social site that i have ever been on it's a huge improvement from the sonic communty the last forum i was on. those moderators cuss you out for doing something wrong and the average membors are even worse. sure there are some @ssess on this site but they are tolerable if not likable at times. so i think the anime forums is a pretty good little site. 
 join kaiju galaxy a site for all kaiju (giant monster fans) sign up is free and theres only one rule no trolls so please dont be a troll, grammer nazi ect... like alot of people are on this site.
 This is my first forum ever. I joined because I wanted to get A bit more familiar with anime, as I'm not the person to just sit and watch A bunch of anime and research it or whatever. I don't watch A lot of anime, read manga or play much VG'S but I do like the discussions that we have that does not concern those topics, strangely enough.I actually did decide to check out other anime forums and they were all so bad compared to this one.. As far as my opinion, well I obviously like it here so that is why I'm still here. <3

 If I remember correctly, I oppened this forum, and the other animeforums.com or whatever its called, and compared the two, I think I chose this because it looked nicer and had nicer topics and posts.

 It is better than jail. So that's a positive. Just barely above jail though....

 Initially joined to get better at writing, mostly. Plus, finishing an anime and not being able to discuss it leaves me with an empty feeling Pretty diverse and nice community we got here it seems. It fits well with my mood swings. Wanna make friends with nice people? you can do that. Want a debate with some semblance of thought and not just trolls? You can do that. Want some high school level drama? we got that, too. 
 
 I've joined plenty of forums, but A4 has been the best so far. There's a bunch of chill people to talk to, the sections here are great for a lot of discussions, and the discussions that I get into are interesting and fun unless politics come up then you have the very few ignorant idiots lol but besides that I really do like everything about A4, and even till this day I can't say I've found myself disliking it. 
 i love A4 there is so many nice people here like Pured Eifa Jellz Cal kudos for them to be putting up with me. I also like how active the fourms are.Its not like ACP where nobody post.

 People know my opinions on A4, it's a pretty crappy place where debating is everything and all one sided at that. I love seeing new faces causes the old are well, old. I also love the writing block, it's where I hang out the most. That said thanks for deleting my previous post. Didn't have what the dictator mods wanted? Sorry if it was you Guy, my hatred is uncalled for then.

 I have joined 5 anime forums and only active in 3 of them. Of course A4 is one of them , yes as all the previous comments before said it , you find here always interesting info about anime , world , music etc... So yeah its fun to be here and to chat with some of you. Of course the mods are strict here but i respect them for their hard work. 
 
 This is the second forum I ever joined. The first forum died and disappeared from the Internet. I will admit, I was much more active back in the early days of my time here. Of course, there were numerous things back then that were bad, but those things have luckily disappeared over the years. As for my opinion on this place....well....I'm still coming here aren't I? If I didn't care for it, why would I keep coming back? True that I don't talk to anyone anymore like I used to so it isn't as exciting as it once was, but what made it good is still present. Interesting topics and unique viewpoints. I keep coming back to say my point if I get interested in something. So, I like this place. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OPossum | Homestuck

I can't really agree with you on that one, the mods don't seem strict at all, in fact they seem pretty damn lenient. I honestly haven't seen them do anything that pertains to the word "strict", everything that they do whether it be closing down a thread or deleting posts is part of their job you can't really blame them for others not reading the rules. 
 The fact that veterans are still here shows that mods are lenient. A4 veterans are probably the biggest douchebags A4 has ever experienced. Except Tenken he's an angel <3 
Currently listening to: SULK - End Time I wanna fade out. 
 I think A4 is pretty cool. I've talked to a lot of cool people since i got here. I would shoutout those people but it would take too long lol. A4 has also given me a place to share my opinion about anime, which is nice being that finding anime fans around me is really hard. Also, even though people always complain about post quality, the posts on A4 are still about 100 times better than every other anime forum i've been to. The OP mentioned MAL...every topic on that forum turns into a flame war without a doubt. The mods do basically nothing. What I don't like about A4? I think that there are certain people on this forum that clearly should be banned but aren't for whatever reason.

Wish A4 would get rid of all the social topics as i've asked for, for many years. ;( But I enjoy reading some posts and a good place to browse when I'm bored.

Except Tenken he's an angel <3 Haha Vess <3 A4 is one of the better anime forums. I have been a member of a few others and honestly, there were very few even half decent discussions. I'm still here after 7 years. Dunno whether to feel happy, or sad about that. :P Some of the vets do have pretty strong personalities, but those are few and far between. Most people are welcoming, tolerant, etc etc. You know, today's douchebags just don't compare to the veteran ones. They don't stick around long enough to get more than one temp ban. lol

 If users wonder why some threads are allowed to continue, and why some users haven't been banned --> They have not technically broken any of the stated A4 rules. Are there users that I find to be unnecessarily abrasive and combative? Yes, without a doubt. However there is no rule on this board to stop someone from being a jerk. Should some mods perhaps act a bit more unbiased? Perhaps, then again, no rules are being broken here. Are some threads better suited for a Highlights magazine? Yes, but once again they technically don't break the rules. While I would enjoy it if everyone actually read the rules faqs, they don't so occasionally they have to be reminded, and as a result we ( the mods ) are called strict... Trust me, this is a thankless job that we as mods do solely to keep things flowing as best we can here. Damage control is the name of the game. We can encourage good posting and civil discussions, however when there is a constant influx of new users, combined with our established users, there is bound to be personality conflicts. Here is a suggestion. Don't feed the trolls, and don't get involved in a thread that is already combative, unless you feel strongly about the points being made and can back them up with facts ( not unfounded opinions ). Basically, don't open Pandora's box, unless you are ready to deal with what you unleash. Also, and a major point here - Our user base ranges from 13 to the 30's ( I think we even have some in their 40's ). So of course there will be differences in opinion, reactions and post quality. We are talking about generations of experiences and differences here. Not to mention the cultural differences/perspectives brought on by our users from other countries. In the end, roll with it, and if you find something that you feel violates a rule, then report it. If enough reports come in on a certain topic or user, then the mods have something to work with. If it is just one person who thinks maybe a rule is broken, or is just having a personality conflict with another, there is little we can do. It is the internet people, we have hundreds of users, so expect some chaos. Now I'm off to delete some bots, lock some redundant threads, and be strict because I expect people to read/follow the rules. Where is my cookie!

 I like this forum so far. I have been a member of many forums (have been moderator in some) and must say I like it here mostly because of the friendly attitude of most members and the pace in which is posted (not too much, but not that slow). Sure there's things to be improved, and I'm not going to make a big fuss over it here, but as an overall anime forums its a good anime&manga forum and I see myself sticking by for a long time.

Basically this ^ I haven't particularly posted much, and the posts I have made are just random posts around the VG/Music sections. I'll probably delve into the RPs, WB and Arts more now that I'm situated, but from what I've seen so far it seems like a nice forum to be on. ^__^
