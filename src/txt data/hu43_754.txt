 Soul Cry Redone
 What is new is bolded. 35; Two Fronts (Revised Part 2)  Spoiler Leaving the house, I find Jenny is waiting for me on Little Sue, her smile the perfect cure for longing for comfort after that terrible conversation with the Mistress. She’s perfectly understandable and I do not get why she says she is not. She said she does not like the way things will end and she wants to prevent that. Worst off, it ends with me somehow. Does Marie have her hands in this as well? The sooner we meet up with Erin the better, I’d like to tell him what I learned from the Mistress. Though we’re going there one last time because he gets released tomorrow with crutches. I personally want to wish him luck and be there for him, he’s there because of me and I want him to know I’m feeling much better. Fate apologized even, that’s a plus. “Come on Clyde we’re going to be late, we do need to get there before visiting hours are up and we have school tomorrow, I’m not sure about you but this break from training gives me little time to catch up on homework.” “Why am I Clyde now?” “Don’t worry about it, come on, what to you anyway?” She ask as I swing a leg over the back of the second bike seat. Settled I wrap my arms around my small friend’s waist and she takes off. We reach the highway soon enough and I find myself more relaxed with Jenny then even Erin, she is a joy to be around and all my troubling thoughts leave me as I yell to her through my helmet within this whirlwind of air. “Thank you.” I do not know if she hears me as she does not show any signs so instead I hug her tightly and she brings a hand down, resting it upon my. And in no time at all we are at the hospital once again. We part with Little Sue and our helmets. Heading inside the main entrances we find something off. Both of us looking at each other with concern as there is no one at the front desk. Outside the build looked fine but now that we are inside, there are no signs of life. Panic sets in as I take off for the elevators and Jenny close on my tail. “This doesn’t seem right.” Jenny says, but she is calmer that I currently am, I cannot stand falling into despair again, and I do not want that. “Everything is fine,” I begin whispering to myself and I try the button for the elevator. The light behind the button never turns on and I keep pressing it, “please, everything is fine.” My voice beings to rise and shake, I am losing it and Jenny see this as she grabs my wrist to stop my excessive pressing of the button to the point where my finger hurts. “We can take the stairs.” I agree with her, only just, I have this terrible feeling draped over me. It feels like when I was with Paul after that dive, I want to forget that, I want to feel safe but that continues to only last for a brief time as I am dragged into these terrible situations again. Our feet pound the steps as we hurry up to the third floor where Erin is hospitalized at. Once we set foot on the top floor in this section of the building we both stop before opening the door, she too now feels that uneasiness I was feeling earlier. She is not as in tuned as I am, and I am not as in tuned with the souls as I once was, but even this, the feeling as if you are being watched seems to shaken her as we creep out of the stairwell and onto the third floor. No lights on and the sun setting earlier as winter approaches, the hall shadows of gray as the sun slowly disappears beyond the horizon, letting in what little light though the sparsely spaced windows. Same with the stairwell but even there the emergency lights remained on, here, nothing. “I’ll take the lead,” Jenny tells me as she sets in front of me and takes my hand as she leads me. We have been here plenty throughout the past few days, visiting Erin and Rane showing up when she could to talk with us. “Everything is fine,” I tell myself, and Jenny grips my hand a little tighter, we both know that is a lie, I am not even sure what I am trying to convince myself otherwise. Though we do make our way to Erin’s room, the door shut and I step forward, trying the knob which does not budge as Jenny takes a try before frowning and punching at the glass window with in the door, thinking she can break it but she squeals and winches, bring her now bruised hand to her chest to cradle it. The door opens to our surprised by a shadowy figure who smiles at us, we are both frighten at first but Tom speaks up, “You came…” he says as if that is the worst possible thing we could have done. He sidesteps the door so we can both enter and Jenny is first followed by me. We both look around the darkened room, our eyes already adjusting and I see Erin with his leg still inclined as Jenny looks at Tom who I now see to have been in a fight, his face covered in welts while his arms and cloths are shredded, blood dripping from everywhere. “You shouldn’t have come,” Erin says quietly, just as quietly as Tom spoke when we entered which he now walks forward, toward Erin, “Eve is here, you guys didn’t happen to see her?” “No,” Jenny comments about the close the door behind us. “I…I mean we got really worried and rush…” “Close that door!” Tom yells, coming forward and covering my mouth while Jenny whips around and closes the door. I’m not watching, but I see a glowing pink hue come across the opposite wall casting the shadows of a lone girl in a wheelchair. Tom’s hand leaves my mouth and he turns back to Erin, “we’ve got to do something, else were stuck here.” “What is Eve doing here?” Jenny asks. “Is that really Eve?” “No idea, and yes, that was Eve,” Erin answers her and I look curiously out the window of the door. She looks as if she is patrolling, she’s coming back… “She’s been away from me for too long,” I answer. “You’re not going out there.” “Why?” I ask, stubbornly, not all too happy that Erin is now being demanding with me, he’s too forward sometimes. Erin looks down at his leg and Jenny speaks up, coming away from the door and resting a hand on my shoulder, “We need a plan…why didn’t you guys call us?” “My phone was destroy trying to fight with Eve earlier and all the phones in the building are dead, we have no access to the outside. This isn’t right though, we’re in a Hospital. What about you Jenny, do you have one?” “Yah, she answers taking her own phone from her back pocket of the jeans she’s wearing and holding it out. “None of this makes sense, we know that, Tom. My only guess is someone else besides Eve is here, Eve is nice to us, and even if she went berserk she wouldn’t attack us.” “Ever heard of blind fury, I doubt your right.” Tom argues back while taking Jenny’s phone in hand. “We know nothing about Eve so how do we fight her if we know nothing? The most we know is only Adam can stop her, he even said so himself.” “Well we also know Adam’s soul is like yours,” Erin points to his brother who only frowns, “if that is right, then you are the best to try and stop her.” “But I’m not Adam,” he replies back. Jenny now cuts in, “Either way Tom, you like to show of your strength, just go out there and don’t die.” “I’m not God.” He answers back, furious that he now has both his brother and Jenny against him. “She’s coming back this way…Tom, please do this, I think Jenny and I can go search for anything if anything is causing Eve to act this way.” “Sure, I’ll be damned meat shield for you all,” He answers sarcastically, placing Jenny’s phone in his own pocket now, “if you haven’t noticed I’m already seriously injured, I’m pretty sure I have a few broken ribs.” “You’ll live, Erin yells back, “Naomi, Jenny, I’m coming with you two, I’m not going to let you to go in harm’s way.” “Says the sack of dead weight.” Tom replies as we all watch Erin struggling to leave his bed. I don’t want him to get injured because of me again, but I’m also scared of what well find if anything. Jenny is a novice with her own soul and me, I haven’t been a full strength for some time, and I can’t even control myself. Erin, well he’s just Erin, he has no powers, and how can he possible think to help us…unless. “Erin, no.” “Naomi, I’ve made up my mind, I am going to help you two find who ever or whatever is causing Eve to go on a rampage and stop her.” He is now out of his sling and falls to the ground as I instinctively rush over to help him up, Jenny follows and we both help him steady himself. “Go get yourself killed, I’ll do likewise,” Tom answers back as he opens the door and we watch as Eve rushes him again, and sending him like a ragdoll down the hall, she continues to go after him while we give each other a joint worried look and head out of the room. Jenny and I balancing Erin. “I don’t like this,” I tell Erin as we enter the all. Tom’s yells and grunts echoing as he tries to defend himself from Eve. “If we survive this we have to talk.” “Don’t jinx yourself,” Jenny adds, trying to lighten the mood but I’m seriously mad at him. This probably isn’t how regular boyfriends and girlfriends ask but I know that we have to talk seriously. He knows he is dead weight just as his brother said, so why is he insisting we bring him along when he can’t even help and he knows that. “Don’t worry, I can help.” “You better not,” I growl at him, he knows I’m mad, he’s just ignore me. We continue to walk, having no idea where to go or what we’re even searching for when a laughter echoes though the hall. It’s not Eve’s but, someone who sounds similar, and sinister, “Come my toys, follow my voice to the psych ward.” “Toys,” Jenny questions, “We’re not your toys,” she yells out and all we get in an eerie girlish laugh. “It matters not, you’ll all break anyway, I’m always way to rough, so please, come and play with me.” “Rane,” Erin speaks quietly, “she is the only person we know from the psych ward.” “It could still be anyone,” I add but Jenny shakes her head. “I think that voice is Rane’s to, it’s different, but I think that’s Rane.” I’m the only one not believing them, but I fear they are right as we come close and closer and her laugher which comes and goes becomes louder and louder. “Finally when we reach the doors and open them, we all gasp, I want to even puke but I hold it in. Rane is waiting for us in a chair of to the side of the front desk here. In the chair next to her one of the nurses that we’ve seen around the hospital has her eyes towards the ceiling, wide open. Her abdomen containing several slash marks while blood drips profusely to a pool forming around her feet, she’s clearly dead. “As you can tell, she broke quite easily.” 2,026 Words 4,863 Words All Together Sorry it's taken me some time to get some new stuff out, I have to go back and redo this, as well as the second part for the Puppeteer chapter because I don't know how to have it work. Naomi getting her arm cut off I placed way to soon before and that screws up my story, or at least how I planned it, so I need to go back and rewrite so everything fits. Nothing really new, or at least no new chapter, just reworked, but I'll get back to the chapters soon, I just need to rewrite one more, and unlike this, I need the scrap the whole part and work on a clean slate. Naomi's coloring is completed, here is how she looks. Thank you Gaff.
