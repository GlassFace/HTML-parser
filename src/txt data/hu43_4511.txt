 What is happening here nowadays?
 Hi guys and gals... I haven´t been here for ages and I found that I kinda missed this geeky place. But I feel lost, what is happening here nowadays? Talking about anime as usual I guess x) As I´m very bored tonight feel free to give some good suggestions of anime or manga. Someone who wants to play some League of Legends perhaps? Or just talk through PM, visitor logg or skype...? (^_^) (T_T) --> #bored, restless, full of lazy energi... Sry for this random and weird post, feel free to ignore this random and lazy person- I won´t feel hurt at all (.__.) *sob*
