 What are conventions like?
 I went to chicago for a con and for the most part it was awesome sauce, I did somehow miss Sir Patrick Stewart's photo op by a few minutes, so plan, plan, plan ahead and construct a schedule so you can get to everything as easily as possible. If your gonna go shopping, try out different vendors for possibly better prices and for the guys, come up with some strategy to battle your bodily urges there will be lots of babes in outfits, sooo calm yourself.
