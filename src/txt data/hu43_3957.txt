 Which movie comic book villians are your favorites?
 As a person who doesn't care for the Thor character in the slightest, I've gotta say Tom Hiddleston's Loki by a mile. Because of his depiction of the character, Thor is perhaps my favorite Marvel film. That said, I didn't actually care for Loki before the film either, and I still wouldn't consider myself a fan of his comics counterpart. I cant say that many of my favorite Marvel characters, villain or otherwise, have hit the big screen. Or, for that matter, the small one. I'd love to see Taskmaster on the big screen, of course, but I expect him to be appearing on one of the Netflix series or Agents of Shield instead. I don't care for the Dark Knight trilogy, and outside of them, I haven't watched any recent DC films. On the other side, Arrow is probably my favorite show on television at the moment, and I'm digging Flash as well. While I expect the film to be a little bit bleh, assuming it even manages to make it to theaters, I'm pretty excited to see Mysterio in Sinister Six.
