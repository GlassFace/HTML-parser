[Personal Life Discussions] What did you dream of being as a kid?
 I wanted to be a vet because I am fond of animals, then a teacher because I do love teaching people things, then an artist. I ended up as a Graphic Designer, so artist wasn't far off. I have considered the idea of teaching at university level, but that isn't something I want to do for quite some time.
