 Please suggest mecha similar to the first part of robotech (Rick hunter et al)
 I'm not sure when I'd get to it but I'd like to get into a mecha again. I'd like it to be similar to the first section of robotech with rick hunter and crew. I'd like that lost in space fighter pilot vibe. I know gundam is a massive mecha series. I wouldn't mind any mecha that's short if possible maybe twelve-twenty four shows. But I'd like it to have that star warsy feel to it. Thanks. It might be awhile before I get to it though. Oh and era doesn't matter. It doesn't have to be 80s.
