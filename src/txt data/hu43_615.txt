 Fantasy Books
 I've read the first two books in The Gentlemen Bastards series. Brilliant writing. If you like books about thieves, it's a slam dunk. From your list, I definitely recommend lining up The Kingkiller Chronicle (Name of the Wind) next. Patrick Rothfuss could narrate a drunk man puking in a gutter and I'd be moved by his prose. He and Abercrombie are likely the best writers in fantasy today.
