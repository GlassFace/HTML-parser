 Solving The Love Triangles
 Only reads this if up to date with manga So, in the last chapter Naruto and Hinata hold hands and they both get plenty of panel time together. This means one of two things; Kishi is either solving the love triangles with NaruHina being the pairing or is building up her eventual tragic death. I'll be honest I almost always give mangaka the benefit of the doubt but if Kishi kills of Hinata for the tragic boom and to make the pairing of NaruSakura easier I'll never forgive him (like it matters but still). Hinata is, and has been my favorite secondary female cast manga character since I started Naruto. I honestly don't know if I would continue reading it if she dies, and the thing is I'm all for realism and deaths in manga (especially shounen bc they're rare), but I doubt I could handle it and would just hate reading the manga after it happens. So do you think Naruto and Hinata holding hands is a sign Ksihi is resolving the love triangles or is building her eventual tragic death, and how do you feel about either?
