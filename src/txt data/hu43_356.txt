 My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
 Considering how fast this show has been spreading across the tubes, I'm actually shocked that there's nothing about it on here, of all places. It's pretty much the best animated show to be created in the past 10 years. Despite it's name, it's actually very rarely girly, and it's not sugary sweet like the previous MLP incarnations, which were basically 30-minute long commercials for the toy line. At the head of the show is Lauren Faust who is known for her work on Powerpuff Girls and Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends (though this show trumps both those). Anyone else watching it?
