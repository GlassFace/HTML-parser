[General Discussion] How popular/well-known are you on A4?
 How popular/well-known are you here on A4? I'm only over a week old, I'm not very popular or well known around the forums, however I have 3-4 friends I communicate with a reasonable amount.  Spoiler This thread sounds weird >: 
 
 With friends and stuff I know a very few and keep in contact with them. But I know a lot of people know me cause I'm on so often.

 Well atm you are well-known blood. I myself am super well known along with my partner in crime, the god, ProtoManX. Don't forget about our sponsors, Zer0 and Oh Snap! And our corrupt lil' mod who takes our bribes; Struggler.

 Not. It would appear my utter lack of charisma seeps its way through the keyboard and over the internet. 
 
 This topic and its responses so far make me want to slit my throat. MoSteel is known for being really, really creepy, and Pured is known for being ass retarded.

 I would say not very. I don't get on very often and I'm still quite new.

 The fact that this was even made into a thread is kinda pointless to be honest, I doubt anyone who comes on here has the intentions or even cares about being "popular" on an internet forum. 
 I'm a lonely scavenger, not very active at the moment either. 

 Alright guys, this isnt a chat thread. Stay on topic or take it to VMs. Also gloating about driving someone to suicide, in jest or not, will not be tolerated. As for me? I dunno, maybe at one time. Not so much these days lol

 I think im pretty well known around these parts. Not sure if that's a good thing though

 I got a private message on here once. Thank god for dupes.

 I obviously can not be sure, however; I'm pretty sure I'm decently well known because I have 64 friends and I converse with a fair bit of them. Also, the majority of users seem to know I'm 13. 
 Popularity on an anime forum...lol. Anyone that's been around for a while and spams enough will become well-known. "Popularity" comes from people actually reading some of that spam and thinking some of the things you have to say aren't too stupid--though, if it's especially stupid, you'll become quite popular as well. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 Also gloating about driving someone to suicide, in jest or not, will not be tolerated. yeah, because it would be pretty intelligent of somebody to gloat about a CRIME on open forum, right? On here, I'm not very well known, but elsewhere..I'm fairly liked on some other forums, despised and even been threatened with my life on one(because the admin is an insecure left-leaning marxist), kept in touch with some on long-dead ones, but overall I'm pretty well liked.

If you are ever suprised at a persons stupidity, you haven't spent enough time on the internet.

Also Ive been trying to keep my personality on the down low lately. Too much attention I dont want lol

 I used to be a little better known here. But over the years, the amount of people I communicated with on a daily basis has diminished until now when I talk to no one on here. So, I could not say how known I am now. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OPossum | Homestuck
 I am very popular. As long as the thread is called glass academy... i would assume the most popular people would be those with thousands of posts, and/or is a mod or admin. 
  Spoiler 
 Doubt I'm known at all, I barely leave the visual arts section 
 Thanks Aoide :3 
 Who wants to be popular on A4? If you're female and nice to people, you'll be very popular. Just don't come crying when some creepy 50 year old comic book fan proposes marriage via PM.... I'll say I told ya so. Lmao. 
 Do you RP, or are you interested in learning? Join our Role Player's Society here on A4. Would you like a baseball bat to shove up your ass along with that stick? You're a mod, please act like one A4 is on FACEBOOK
 The only way to know if you're "popular" is to figure out how much other people talk about you.

Having thousands of posts isn't necessarily indicative of how well-known someone is on a forum. ^^ Technically, I have thousands of posts, but distribute that amount over 10 years, and my posts per day are really, really low. I think some people have become fixtures of the community, in a sense. Those who have been here a long time and post regularly are bound to be noticed, while others make their presence known in a relatively short amount of time. It's easy to be dismissive and scoff at this subject, but I think online communities are sometimes the last bastion for people who suffer from social anxiety, don't have any friends, etc. I have friends and a social life (sometimes I just want to retreat into my cave and never come out, though) now, but that doesn't somehow make me more 'normal', or what have you. I'm a complete shitshow, for the most part. Sometimes I wonder how my life would've turned out if I had retained my interests in gaming or whatever instead of going to the dark side, haha ^__^ I'm not encouraging anyone to be totally reclusive, but hey, there are far worse things you could be that could make your life unravel much, much faster.

 I am THEE most popular person on A4. I am also the most beautiful. Clever, too. I've been described as the 'complete package'. I agree with that, of course. It's the truth.
