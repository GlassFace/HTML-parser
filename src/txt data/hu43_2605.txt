 What is One Piece?
 What are your theories on what the "treasure" One Piece could be? I believe that it's not a treasure because Buggy does not appear interested in it, and he is very obsessed with treasure at most other times in the series, and he would know if the One Piece is really a treasure or not, being a part of Roger's crew. Many people speculate that it has to to with the ancient weapons, the void century, The Will of D., and many other things. What are your thoughts? 
hi
 Hmmm you have a point, buggy is one of the greediest pirates in the One Piece universe, I've thought about it and here are some of my thoughts on why Buggy isn't chasing after One Piece: 1. One piece is a treasure but may not be made of gold or has no economic value. Instead it might be something that Roger personally treasured. 2. Buggy might be greedy but he's kind of a coward too. He being a part of roger's crew, he might know how to get to Rafter but he also knows how dangerous it is to get there and wouldn't want to risk his life getting there. Aside from that, he know's there are many strong pirates out there especially Roger's rivals that became yonkos. ....I strongly believe that one piece is linked to the void century because it can be found on the same island as the Rio Poneglyph 
 Just like in Skies of Arcadia. One piece will be one piece of coin with a note attached saying something about how nakama are the greatest of all treasure along with adventure and freedom etc.

Well we all know either Kish or Kubo has the title locked man. But we will see in the next 10 years there about.

But we will see in the next 10 years there about. It would be a giant troll. I hope I am right! I already got two major shonen long calls right. I called Yachiru being Kenpachi's imagination or his sword a couple years ago and I was right about the imagination part. I also called Naruto using sexy jutsu against the final boss and winning with that.....and I was..(ok I was half right). I did this about a year ago as well I think. It may not had killed final boss and it was a bit of a different jutsu, BUT it did work on her lol.
