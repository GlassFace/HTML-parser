[General Discussion] Need help identifying Kanji in picture

I have no idea how to read the old style, I only know modern chinese hanzi. Characters 2,3,4 and 5 are hirigana. In order they are pronounced: re, u, na, i Not quite correct. The first kanji is read as "o" in this case. The word is 終わらない (owaranai), which means "neverending"　or "does not end." The first two hiragana characters are wa and ra, not re and u. The second kanji character is 夢、which alone is "yume" (dream), but since it comes at the beginning of a word it is read as "mu" in this case. The last character is 廻, which I believe is read as "kai" here. It's a rarer form of the kanji although the font used in the picture is probably partially to blame, which seems to be the name of a song from an anime. Normally the character 廻 means "to rotate." The phrase read out is "owaranai mukai," which could be roughly translated from the characters as "the turning (repeating? rotating? turning?) dream which never ends." That's the best I can do as it seems to be a stylistic choice so you'd probably need a native speaker to interpret it better.
