 Which cheesy movies do you like and why?
 Well there are plenty of cheesy music threads but I don't think there are too many cheesy movie threads. Me? I would admit that the 1999 mystery men movie is probably considered cheesy but I love it! The comedy is just brilliant. Also I am a card carrying bill and ted fan. I was like ten when it came out and it just got in my system and never let go. Oh and i like basically all the Godzilla movies What about you? Oh I also love mystery science theater 3000.
