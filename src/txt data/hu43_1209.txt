 have you ever been in love
 Never been in love. Don't fall in love too easily for sure. Had a hugh crush recently. she said she wanted to give it a go but wasn't sure... You can't make a bigger mistake then that tbh. Everything felt forced and now our relationship is worse then it could have ever been. She just ignores me now pretty much. And even tough i'm so mad because of this, i still like her and still think about her every day...
