 That mistake you wish you had never committed
 When I was just seven years old I had accidentally hurt my school mate pretty bad. We were throwing stone chips at each other( we were kids and completely mad) and this one chip hit his forehead. He had to undergo surgery. But oddly enough, after that incident, we became best buddies. It's been 12 years but I still regret on hurting my friend so bad. Do you have any mistakes you wish you had never committed. Keep 'em posting. 
 A few years back, there was this girl. We hung out at this local card shop (I played Yugioh) and she decided to start a friendship with me. After a couple weeks we were talking about sketches and she asked me to come see her sketches so I said yes. She shows me a few and while we're outside at her car, she confides something in me: lately her boyfriend had been neglecting her and feels that he was only keeping her around for eye candy. I tried to think of some advice to give her, but then she dropped a bombshell on me: she had been thinking on leaving him and already had two ideas on who to date afterwards, although she was leaning towards one of them already. When I asked who, she started blushing and had trouble looking me in the eye, then I realized that she was referring to me. I was really shocked at this "confession". She noticed this and said told me that there was still time and I didn't have to answer her right away. It wasn't long before I had to move, but in the few times I did see her, I was so nervous around her and I didn't think to at least get her number or email. I feel really stupid for not doing so because, looking back, she was the only girl to have had an interest in me.

Somebody else might be across the horizon. 
 I regret breaking up a fight between two friends (both liked me, but not each other). That was a bad idea, since both of them NEVER wanted to let it go (years and years it went on). If I could go back, I'd walk away from their arguing without hesitation. Getting involved created a split between us that lasted forever, and they both were forcing me to choose a side. Eventually I broke contact them both, because was I tired of dealing with being the "middle man". Oh yes, they still hate each other to this day, but both wished me well so at least some closure was obtained.

Keep 'em posting. You are doing it wrong. If a good thing came out of a bad thing, then you should be thankful, not regretful. It would be like regretting becoming best friends with your best friend. As for the actual topic, no, I have not done anything so bad to where I whole-heartedly wish I never committed... except maybe for all the little insets I tortured when I was little.

 I regret nothing. I choose to learn from my mistakes instead of wondering about what might have been.

 Nothing really. I soon forgot about it once I've learned what i have done. 
 Probably passing on a turned over mortage that my parents offer to help us get. That house sold for 100k more the following year Idea of a mortage scared us so we passed. Booo. 
 I wish I had read the rating on my vary 3 anime that I ever watched and not judge a book by its cover cuz........it terned out to be a TV.MA ........i was and kinda still am scared for life Q~Q 
 Lmao, confessing my love to certain people - being in a relationship can be followed by breaking a friendship. 
 
 Every romantic relationship I've had prior to my current would be a good start. I seem to have a knack for picking insane/*******s for dating purposes, and it's depressing. 
 I went to college and got a degree in a field I kinda wanted no part of. I stuck with it and that decision (amongst others still annoys the **** out of me). I made so many mistakes regarding my academic career. Picking schools, majors, subsequent work/volunteer ventures. I suppose one of the biggest problems I had was too much pride and not being able to change. That aside, if I made any other "mistakes" at the time I made them, it was the best or sometimes the only course of action available to me.

 hmm, i regret that one day, i was a very stupid student, it was about 2 years ago, i was caught shoplifting, i was beaten by my dad when i got home.....i was an idiot 
 I don't regret anything in my life except the way I treated my first girlfriend. Chick was wild and the sex was great but at the time i wasn't interested in a relationship because I liked her friend. So I was just mean to her until she broke up with me.

 My mistake was not becoming a more social person earlier in my school life and leaving myself now in a very lonely senior year.

 If I didn't make the mistakes I have made, I wouldn't be where I am now. I regret nothing.

 I regret nothin'. I learn from my mistakes. 
 So many books, so little time.
 So I've pretty much mentioned this in every one of these threads, I guess I'm hoping by mentioning it noone's dumb enough to repeat my mistakes. Cherish the time you have with others. Back in highschool: I was on my way home one day after class when we came upon a car accident at this intersection. There was debris strewn all over the road, the vehicles that collided looked like one big mass that had fused together, it was really impossible to tell much of anything apart. There was blood everywhere, seeping out of the wreckage, all over the glass in the road, puddles slowly working their way toward the storm drains in the street. Emergency services was already on scene, and they were wrestling with a bloody tarp, trying to draw it over the wreckage. We sat there for a few minutes stuck in traffic, just watching this scene play out, and I turned to one of my buddies and said "sucks for them," meaning the people in the accident, and let out a little laugh. Next day we found out that several of the people killed in the crash were some of our close friends. Everything from how I interacted with them previously to what I said that moment at the intersection I absolutely regret. I've been through quite a bit, made many dumb and foolish mistakes, but this is the only thing I absolutely regret Cross post from: http://www.anime-forums.com/showthread.php?152524-any-one-thing-you-would-take-back Suggest merging both threads as they cover the same topic and are dated within one month of each other. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 Should probably not have joined the Army and picked infantry with a prior existing heart problem... But hey, you ever try telling a stupid 18 year old what he can and can't do?

 I regret not peeing that morning before taking that exam. 
 Thanks, A4. I met my love through you.  Spoiler "Hououin Kyouma is...Okabe Rintarou."- Makise Kurisu 
 When I was a freshman in high school, I wish I had gone out with the girl in my gym class that asked me out. I was so nervous because she was so hot and I felt a girl like that could never want me. So I lied to myself until I convinced myself she wasn't being truthful. She was and I lost the chance to get my self-confidence up and maybe have a little fun, something I have yet to do even to this day. I wish I had kept close to the friends I had in school. I lost all contact with them and it is highly unlikely I will see them again. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OPossum | Homestuck
 Having a fight with a really good friend that I treated like a sister. She made some foolish mistakes and accidentally got pregnant to her then boyfriend, who was also a tool, and I wasn't there when she needed help. I had an argument with her and gave her the cold shoulder after calling her "a ****ing slut and if you don't want it, get an abortion." I was about 20 or so back then and she was 17. We'd been friends for about 3 years and at that moment I completely disregarded her bipolar depression. I actually don't know if she's still alive cause I lost complete contact with her not long afterwards and she attempted suicide a few years earlier.

 I regret dating so many people in high school and being so native about it. It really messed up my just recent relationship because my parents have "forbid" us from seeing each other anymore lol 
 Being too obsessed with needing people and friends.
