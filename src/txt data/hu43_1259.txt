 [EVENT] New Site Banners for A4
 Thanks everyone who submitted banners for the last rotation. Those are now live. There were so many great banners that there are now maybe 50 in the current rotation. Well done everyone, they look fantastic! I am opening the thread for the next rotation. Dimensions: are 1000 x 200 Format: Jpeg. - There is no point in uploading massive png files to the site as they take too long to load. Theme: Again, You may submit a banner of any anime that you want, but I am looking for banners of 2013 anime for the summer/fall season for the next rotation to keep it current. Staff will choose the best 20 or so (more if we have a high standard) and they will all be put up in the next rotation. Please use the bannerage sticky to look for advice on new banners if you feel you need some help rather than posting 100 versions in here. XD. People are usually pretty helpful. Good luck! Deadline: July 31st

 May I suggest using a specific font in an attempt to make our banners more uh, well, "uniformized"?

No no, wait...Comic Sans... Hehehe! But, meh joking aside, I think it would limit people. Like the couple of fonts that you used on your banners up there looks awesome, but then if you stick it on something I made, not so much because of the difference in style. I try to match fonts I use to the style of the banners I make, or the theme.

 Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide. *Bill The Butcher - Gangs Of New York* 
 Would love to make a banner but I have no idea what the latest animes are. 
 Carpenter Brut - Le Perv | David L. Puga - Egg-Shaped Prison(Dr. Robotnik Theme) | Sabrepulse - Milotic - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - "Thank you for riding the Psycho Express, Toot-toot! All aboard, I'll be collecting your tickets, we have beverages in the DINING CAR!!!" - Krieg 
 Got a summer-ish one here. 

 A couple of banners to start off my entries @Mo: The second picture is so amazing that I just cannot hold myself to make a banner out of it, so here.  Spoiler

 ^ Please no To Love Ru, I hate that show with a passion and I don't want to see it dirtying up A4. But I have no authority in that; mod joke...kind of, I am copying Brook from One Piece without the yohohohoh laugh.

 If guys aren't gonna post anything useful for the thread take your little bickering to PMs or VMs. Also, I don't think saying you had an idea and then forgetting really helps the cause at all as well. ------ Banners below:  Spoiler Thought some Manga exclusive things would be a nice change, so here's some DOGS: Bullets and Carnage

 Since we're heading towards a new rotation, Summery themed banners, and banners including shows from the upcoming 2013 Summer Season would be most appropriate! If you don't know what's airing this coming season, check out this thread: http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...013-Anime-List
