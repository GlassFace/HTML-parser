 A4 Stream/Podcast This Sunday
 Shian, Ian, and myself are pleased to announce that this coming Sunday (Nov 3rd) we'll be sitting down to do A4's first official regular live broadcast. We'll be doing the whole thing on Twitch.tv, and later Shian will release the audio of the stream as a podcast for those of you who missed it and want to listen to our soothing voices while you work out or something. The format is generally pretty loose but it'll go something like this: Forum news. We'll ask Shian what's new with the forum and what might be planned as well as make announcements and try to draw attentions to events or threads that we like.Anime discussion. Anime both new and old will be brought up, starting off with the new, and we'll talk about the shows we like, the shows we hate, and why we like/hate them.Gaming discussion. Here we talk about games, the game industry, and just games in general. Since we'll be doing this live users are encouraged to call in and share their thoughts, ask questions, or just shoot the **** for a few minutes. To call in you'll need Skype, so get an account now if you don't have one already and you want to have your voice heard. The Channel: http://www.twitch.tv/shiankiri Time: sometime in the afternoon. Subscribe to the channel or watch the A4 Facebook page to find out when we go live.
