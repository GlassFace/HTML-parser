 The Last Good Samaritin?
 Landlord refuses to evict jobless tenants Instead, he takes a job to help pay the bills while the families try to get back on their feet. Posted by Mai Ling at MSN Real Estate on Friday, September 25, 2009 11:23 AM It's yet another tale of heartbreak, except this one ends with the kind of warmth you only expect on the Hallmark Channel. Ed Peirce, a landlord who lives in Rock Hill, S.C., had a couple of options when both of the tenants in his two West Virginia rental houses lost their jobs and could no longer pay rent. The most obvious option was to evict them, but for Peirce, that might have been the last option on his list. No, this man, a 54-year-old ordained minister profiled in The Herald of Rock Hill, instead took a job paying $8.50 an hour in the photo department at the local Walgreens to make his own ends meet while his tenants get back on their feet. From the article: "I sat with them and prayed for better times," Peirce said. "These are stand-up guys. Family men. Proud. They paid me before, when they were working. You don't show your faith, your Christianity, in words. You do it in deeds." http://realestate.msn.com/blogs/list...2247&gt1=35000 Next time the banks **** up the economy, I say we make them cut this guys' lawn for $8.50 an hour.
