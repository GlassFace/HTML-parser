 Thoughts on The Walking Dead Season Two Endings
 I was just wondering what other people's thoughts were on the endings to Season Two of the The Walking Dead as it was the first time the series has included multiple endings(there were five endings total)? Would you have preferred one ending like the previous season? Or did you like having multiple endings? Which was your favorite ending? What about your least favorite?
