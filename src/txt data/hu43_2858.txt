 Marvel Films You're Waiting For?
 Originally Posted by goji2099 Actually, I was legit curious what made it dark and gritty. Not only do I think they are going more realistic, I think this is "proper" realism. As opposed to the version or Realism from the Batman films (or the X-Men films early on) where they feel realism is about subduing fantastic elements... They seem focused on trying to figure out how the fantastic elements work in a real world setting instead, as well as how people react to them. Tonally, I don't think it is dark. I see it more as a cautious optimism, looking at the potential gains but well aware of the risk. It harkens back to the early days of Space Exploration, when so many were lost trying to cross that next great barrier. Huh... Well, that I could actually agree on. It does feel less pretentious, in a sense, than the Nolan realism (not that I mind Nolan's take on the Bat-films myself). I've been trying to drive this point home to these commentators on YouTube, but you know how YouTube commentators usually are. Anyway, yeah, this might be a good step for Marvel superheroes if this is a hit. Of course, the biased fanboys would probably get in the way, ensuring that this becomes a flop instead.
