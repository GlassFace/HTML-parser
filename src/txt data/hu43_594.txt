 Fantasy Books
 I actually started reading Mistborn by recommendation of a friend. He was like "you should read it, the main character is a lot like you in ways." Hah, some things yes. I really can identify a lot with her. It's a great series. Already half way through the second book. I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it. I've also started reading Trudy Cadavan's "Thief's Magic," which is well written as well. I stopped half way through because it's a large hardback copy and I can't take it with me on the bus when I go to work. Too big to lug around. However, I will finish it once I finish the Trilogy I'm reading. I've been reading a silly one that's a bit of a cross over between Sci-fi and fantasy. "The Long Earth" by Steven Baxter and Terry Pratchett. It's also part of a trilogy. It's pretty funny if you like black humour.
