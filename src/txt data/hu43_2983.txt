[Mecha] Gundam Build Fighters Try
 Sekai, no pain no GAIN. Castle going down, Fall of the House of Usher! The Nocebo-Effect Assimilation is so funny, it's too dramatic. IT CAN TRANSFORM TOO, THE HYPE. Charlie Sheen would be damn proud of that "Winning!" particle beam. Hoshino did something straight out of ****ing Berserk! Lady is just creeping on those two young rivals, both want Sekai and want to win. Eyyyy, it's China! Sei asks her to do a lot of things to him, in private of course. HE JUST CAME IN CLUTCH FOR THE BUILD BURNING, THAT'S OUR PROTAGONIST FROM LAST SEASON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. And the sword is passed down to a worthy hero, who shall wield it with burning flames. What a lovely ending, this series is ****ing wicked.
