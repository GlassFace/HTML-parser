[Manga] Opinions on Kill La Kill and Gunslinger Girl
 Hi friends, I am almost finishing reading Gunslinger Girl and will after that start with Kill La Kill =)) Is it a good read? Story seems quite engaging and I can't wait...Will also watch the anime more or less at the same pace And regarding Gunslinger Girl... Are there any alike genres but with a little bit more of action? Best, Bruno
