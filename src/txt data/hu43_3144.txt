 Sac?
 yup i believe so thanks xd, i dont really have much knowledge about anime i just watch watever pretty much and if i like it awesome if not o well. its more of a kinda way of deflecting when i deal with league since i tend to do so a lot since its hard to drop the game when im challenger :/ even if it bores me... didnt think about it based on the sequel i guess u could say name i thought the SAC would represent the actual anime name
