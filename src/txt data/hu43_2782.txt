 Dear A4
 Hey there I'm really excited about this forum, it looks really interesting to me. I'm not going to tell alot about me, but hopefully you'll know about me in a few years when I will release an anime... itÂ´s been a dream since a very young age.. looking forward to get to know people here and btw, i'm on vacation right now. When i'll go back home i'll be active as hell.
