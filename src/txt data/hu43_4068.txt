[Personal Life Discussions] What did you dream of being as a kid?
 An oil painter. I might have been the strangest five-year-old around. But that was my dream I decided one day. When I was able to read more I would take out as many books from the school's tiny library on painting and wanted to absorb every fact about it. I also did a lot of writing and read my stories out loud (sometimes improvised) to classmates. Then again, I used to spend time sitting in my closet reading old anthropology textbooks on Native American culture and literature.
