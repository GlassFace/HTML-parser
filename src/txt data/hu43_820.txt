[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires - Page 6
 Man just finished the last two episodes, and I gotta say, the ending bothered me at first. But after giving it some thought and reading other peoples opinions. I actually think it was a good fit for the series. I just hope that they do another season or some sort of movie or big OVA on all the unanswered questions, cause I have a lot lol. It kind of felt rushed at some points, and the memories fading away could've been done better, but the action, excitement and ending made up for those minor points of critique. Great Anime! It had everything and more...it was different in it's own way, shocking at points (death of certain characters, plot twists and ofcourse the "rape" scene) and I loved it looks and music. So i'm wishing for more... 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 It was a hell of a trainwreck throughout and the ending felt surprisingly tame. I was kinda disappointed in how normal and expected it all turned out after all the wacky plot twists and shark jumps that had been going on for two seasons. Okay show overall, I guess. 

 Well my top 3 favorite songs of course. Those would be hysteria by nano, passion by Utada Hikaru and yes it's the kingdom hearts theme. My third would be I guess roller coaster by Luke Bryan I don't care for country but this song has a ton of re listen to value.

Lack of good plot and authentic settings, but its story gives some impact in its own way.

 Action was great, animation was great, it was like a fantastic B-movie plot with sprinkles of intense genre injections to keep you hooked even though it was badly written at times.
