[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 The story is set in an era when 70% of the human race lives in space due to the development of space cities. Between two major powers—the Dorushia Military Pact Federation and the Atlantic Ring United States (ARUS)—there is a small neutral nation called Jiouru that has prospered economically. The protagonist Haruto, a high school student who lives in Jiouru, encounters the mysterious "forbidden" humanoid weapon Valvrave when the Dorushia army invades. This was an unexpected surprise that popped up today! Very intriguing characters and story. I'm not even a fan of mechas, but this show looks good! Make sure you watch past the ending sequence of the first episode for a nice surprise. I can't say anymore without spoilers, but you won't be disappointed!

 So many mechas aired this season , havent seen it yet. If it has some decent story+ action i will try it. 
 
 Predicable, I'm moving on.

 The first episode is good, but somehow not surprising. Sudden attacks, sudden mecha entrance by suddenly a pilot commoner. All of them seems to be a standard for mecha animes. But since I like mechas, so yeah, watching this.

 Lol what happened to him at the end? some vampire anime , this is to much for me. The part where Shoko died was sad.

That's why it's predictable, I was fine with watching the anime until that point although I finished the first episode in case she somehow lived but I that didn't happen and thus I dropped it there and then. Plus the main character is a wimp so why watch that.

 Yeah this isn't looking very good. Gundam Seed with an even less inspired cast and plot, and less explanation. The only thing that's at all interesting is the weird ass laser vampirism crap after the credits. 

 I thought episode 2 was pretty awesome. The whole switching bodies thing, i didn't see that coming. and also not sure how I feel about SHOKO'S "DEATH being like the main driving force for the main characters action ( Hmm where have I see this beforee? (We all know) ) Love will make you do crazy things huh? He did like a complete 360 in his personality, or has he always been like that? he just needed it to be brought out of him. Plus now that we find out she's not really dead, that was the part where I sighed in relief, he's in too deep now, and I'm interested in what's to come for him. Plus that L-elf guy, is a great soldier, it's safe to say now he's gonna be up against his side for most of the series. 

 Ep 2 was off the rails. I don't know if it's going to be the good kind of trainwreck or the bad kind, but I'm probably in it for the long haul. 

 This show has the lets watch to see how it unfolds feel to it. Not quite sure what I think or sure if I will like it but continuing to watch because it could potentially be really interesting. 
 
 Hahaha holy ****. Episode 4 continues the amazing madness. CALL ME MOSES Every giant robot needs to have a swiss army knife rifle. God damn. 

 How old is TM Revolution now? God I feel like he should be an old man now. Everything about this show screams Guilty Crown, but at least it's hilarious.

 Anyone else read the title as 'Valvrave The Vibrator? Ky, I'll just go be dyslexic somewhere else. I got the first 4 episodes so I know what I'll be doing on for Wednesday afternoon. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Episode 5 was like a god damn episode of Ren and Stimpy.  Spoiler 

 I watched the first 2 and a half episodes and yeah, seems like a generic robot anime as written by Shadow Fox after dropping some acid. Think I'll watch the rest now seeing as I'm too shafted to go upstairs and watch JOJO.

Think I'll watch the rest now seeing as I'm too shafted to go upstairs and watch JOJO. my thoughts too. About to watch episode 3. You should watch susei no gargantia though. 
 SIghh.. This Rukinon girl is a fool, and apparently she got herself into something she wont be able to get out of. I forsee a bad ending for her honestly. 

 ned, stop giving me anime to watch. Its not ok anymore. My plan to watch list is now at 175. Seriously, stahp. 
 Watched the first 4 eps, and up untill now it's so/so...L-Elf (ridiculous names by the way) is an ok char, Shoko and Haruto mweh, cybergirl is fresh...the rest I could care less up till now... At least the fight scenes and L-Elf escape were of the tsjisain. I'll be sitting this one out as wel, not because this show is such an eye opener, but cause I like the 2 planets fighting over 1 neutral planet concept. Storywise it has to do better, cause up till now it's kinda foggy and the (re)actions predictable. And also the whole social media, cell phone thingie is blown way outta proportion... 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 I love that the idol in the story (Rukino Saki) is played by an actual Sony-signed singer (Tomatsu Haruka) and they have her sing in the show. Check out her Good Luck for You rendition in Episode 5. Awesome!

 I'm liking this series so far its one of the many I do enjoy for the spring season. Although, I do want to find out how this whole partner thing with L-Elf will turn out, and who will pilot the other Valvrave's. 
 The show is totally nuts in all the best ways. I mostly just want to know what that 200 years in the future bit was about.

Well given that Rukino named her robot after a lesbian Vampire and Haruto also seem to be immortal, my think is that Rukino ended up with Shoko. Could be total misdirection, though!

Could be total misdirection, though! Lol never thought of it that way. but I also can't see the show going in that direction.
