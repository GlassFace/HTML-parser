 Yasuo is a ton of fun. I suspect that he'll be nerfed but man, I haven't had this much fun in top lane since Riven came out. 

 LCS EU Promos had a freakin great first day! Meet Your Makers got swept aside as Copenhagen Wolves proves they are more than just a squad of body guards for their former star Bjergerking. Really great to see Youngbuck finally accomplish his goal to get in after 2 failed attempts. Nice too see his hard work pay off.

 I've played versus Youngbuck before two years ago. Don't really like him all too much but gratz anyway! They beat the polish overlords.

 SHC over SK 2-0 so far. Utter stomp in the second game and some really great planning and reactions. Very well done. 

 Nope nope nope. Negatory SHC. Throws so strong? SK goes to LCS 3 games to 2 

 SK vs SHC, started the day having lost 2 of 5 games, one loss more would push them out of the League Series for season 4. They rally together, and win 3 straight games, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. When enough is up for grabs, motivation becomes a force multiplier.

I feel like whenever EUW teams and NA teams pick Lee Sin they lose. Koreans and Takera only obviously.

It's like seeing one of the newer Dynasty Warrior games with weapon swapping and seeing Guan Yu using the great sword...jarring, but nothing more. I may pick it up at some point, as I like it more than his demonblade skin. The Riven skin is one of those unfortunate skins that I like, but will never purchase since I already have a better one (Championship in this case). Otherwise I think it's her new second best skin. Very nice. Diana's doesn't really interest me as I don't play Diana anymore (and I like her default more anyway). 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 The new art for the spells is so godamn confusing lol. 
 Originally Posted by Struggler Guan Yu -- I mean Warring Kingdoms Tryndamere I see what you did there. Tryndamere looks awesome. I love the animation differences on Riven but it still won't beat Battle Bunny for looks. The Diana looks awesome, but feels pricey because of no new animations/particles effects. 

 I'm loving the skin for Riven actually. I think its the first one for her that has new particles, its done really well. Not sure if I should pick it up with all the hate going on for Riven right now, I sense a nerf soon. Originally Posted by Ian the Korean .

Sometime during the preseason I'm sure.

 Diana looks so freaking ugly. Looks like a nerf to kassasin beard man they are trying to increase his skill cap level but meh I'm not sure If they are balancing him or nerfing him completely. Love the Anivia buff but not sure why olafs change matters too much.

 According to some of the forums I frequent. Alot of people are saying that we will probably be seeing more "Bruiser Kass," builds based off the direction the went with these changes. maybe even jungle. Meh.and Yeah that diana skin is fugly.

 Kassadin is a problem in his current state, you shouldn't be surprised that they're experimenting with him to change his fundamentals. 

 ^^^ Inb4 replacing his ult because blink is just too strong and anti fun lolololol. I'm back *****es.

 Until Kass gets gutted I will eternally be sour about what they did to Ahri. On a side note, I earned my first Yasuo win! I say earned because the first one was a 4v5. It took maybe five straight games of getting wrrrreeeeecked. It finally clicked though, and I happened to slaughter RiotTantram and three of their friends. It was a fun game. Made them laugh a few times. More League games should be like that one. : D  Spoiler As far as the man himself goes, I think he's extremely difficult to play. The amount of awareness of your surroundings that you need to play him to his fullest potential is probably higher than Lee Sin's. inb4 Tak hate.

In fact, I think that the fact that he has to put himself up there is a great potential trade off that at the moment isn't much of a trade off. I think his combo is just too strong, it does a lot of damage and prevents a lot of immediate retaliation.

With Six Crit Reds, a Shiv, and Infinity Edge, he hits 100% crit chance, and that's usually as far as I itemize him offensively. After that, I don't know what to build. Been trying Frozen Mallet, that works ok, as he can proc it at range with his Q. Randuin's is always good, BV or Visage to round it out. I see some people using a lot of attack speed, which I think is a trap for him because your Q is on such a low CD that you can weave it between regular auto attacks for ridiculous deeps. Shiv would be the exception though, because that crit and movement speed, plus the static passive is really important. The way I've been playing him, I try to use his ult as an execute, but it doesn't really work because it usually puts you in the middle of a pile of people who can make Yasuo not Yasuo very fast. After executing your ult, you get 50% ARpen towards bonus armor for 15 seconds. What that communicates to me is that after you use your ult to successfully execute an enemy, you use that Pen to close out the fight against their tanks. Like I said though, I've had trouble using his ult to execute, and if you build him full glass cannon assassin, you had better have insane spatial awareness or a cork for your anus, cause you'll take it in the ass really fast if you're not careful. I honestly think that he would be really good for Lee players to pick up. Really high skillcap, split second decision making kind of champion.
