 [Mysterious Girlfriend X] Season 2???
 Hey There! ^^ I just finished watching "Mysterious Girlfriend X" and I'm curious if there is going to be a second season? I've already googled quite a bit of information regarding the issue at hand but I have been unable to find any solid proof that a second season is, indeed, on its way! I really hate watching a show then being cut off when it's at a good part, I saw the "The End" at the last episode I saw and was all like "OH HELL NO, You can't cut me off like this!!!" and well yeah fury ensued shortly afterward. If anybody has any information regarding this and knows with 100% certainty that what you're saying is true then please leave a comment letting me know so that I can try and move on or eagerly anticipate a second season! Thanks! Sincerely, Monzta
