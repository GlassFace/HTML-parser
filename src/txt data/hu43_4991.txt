[Anime] would you like ulquiorra to come back
 do you want ulquiorra back in bleach, why or why not personally i think no, just because more loved bleach characters need to die for the drama ( similar to how attack on titan is like) to support the fans that want him back heres an idea heres a video that supports ulquiorras come back https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RfDohNkqaU now if whats said in this video is accurate, than can ichigo bring ulquiorra back like he did with ichibe, by speaking his name and again i dont support this, i just want peoples opinions on how this will affect the series. Is it a good idea for (some) fans, or a bad idea
