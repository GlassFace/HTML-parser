 psychological thriller/ action anime suggestions?
 I recently started liking thrillers. I really liked Death note and Attack on titan, also I recently finished Mirai Nikki and Tokyo ghoul and loved them . I would like an anime that has a combination of thriller and action something similar to Tokyo Ghoul or Attack on Titan, with blood and gore .
