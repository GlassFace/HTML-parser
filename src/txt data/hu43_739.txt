[Asian Music] K-pop Anyone?
 I love J-pop also but are there any k-pop fans here at all? There are a lot of really upbeat Korean music that I really love. Does anyone here like any K-pop songs? My favorite song/music video is Nu Abo by F(x) they are my favorite girl k-pop band. :3 If anyone likes any other K-pop singers/band please share <3 ^^ Here's the video for Nu Abo I hope you love it just as much as I do :3

 Kpop is pretty bad in terms of music honestly. I just like watching the korean girls dance. 
 I don't think it exactly fits K-pop but I like a lot of big bangs stuff and a lot of their solo stuff This one comes to mind, not a fan of the video but the music is pretty cool. I like K-pop most of the stuff is quite upbeat, great work out/dance music.

 K-Pop's pretty catchy, that's why I like it. Like Taeyang's song that Ta-Ka provided...it's more of an American R&B/Hip-Hop inspired track that's considered K-pop..I like those that are more different from the usual bubbly stuff of the many K-pop girl groups and boy bands.

 Yeah, Tae Yang has awesome stuff, this one is my favourite, I even took the effort to play it on the piano, love the melody in the background.  Spoiler

Hallelujah is one of my favorite songs along with Fantastic Baby. I didn't really like the music video of Fantastic Baby but I really like the song. I have other songs that I like that they sing but I can't remember all of them at the moment.

 I gave it a chance and I found I didn't like it, it was to 'poppy' for my taste.

 Hmm I like f(x) too, but I recon their other songs are much better, e.g. electric shock No.1 = 2NE1 :3

 oh hey kpop with real musicians! 
Currently listening to: SULK - End Time I wanna fade out. 
 Gangnam Style would you consider it K-pop? i dont 
 Dubstep Chaos Theory - ShockOne l Siren - Kat Krazy ft Elkka l Faith - BlasterJaxx 
 Nah, I don't really label Gangnam Style k-pop either. I was a little upset that it became so popular, I mean I think the song is funny but there are a lot of great K-pop songs out there that should be more popular than Gangnam Style is. Here's some SHINee!! I love them this is my most favorite song they made:

 gangnam style is not kpop because the performer is not good looking. otherwise it would be kpop 
Currently listening to: SULK - End Time I wanna fade out. 
 Shinne is a pretty gay name. my gaydar is off The boybands that overuse liner are so much predominate that they undermine actually good bands in korea that can play instrumets. I remember actually being surprised listening to a Korean rock band that is good and I can't recall the name of the band anymore. oh well. Typical boybands though is what describes most of kpop. 
 Most boy bands whether where they are from seem to be effeminate. I guess they think the fans like that.

 i've just gotten into k-pop recently, i'm a fan of the choreography. BTOB and U-KISS caught my eye! 
 Yeah, it's not too bad. I don't really take any of it seriously, but I do like a few groups and their songs as pure entertainment and novelty. 2NE1 is one of my favorites, and my favorite song from them is Hate You, no particular reason. The whole chorus in Korean sounds hilarious.  Spoiler 
Individual Eleven: Rise Up. Never conform.

I wish I had more of their songs I only have two so far though. I haven't heard of BTOB but I'll check them out sometime. Originally Posted by Kyō Yeah, it's not too bad.

 Speaking of kpop, theres this insanely cute girl in my japanese tutorial that looks just like my fac member of my fav band, aka, Bom from 2NE1 Sat next to her and we talked a bit and asked her if she was into kpop and if her look was inspired by bom shes like yeah Proto has some competition now.

If I can find them on youtube I'll put a spoiler at the bottom. I got both of them from my friend on my birthday last year. I'm kind of picky with songs too so I know what you mean. Just listened to WOW and it's really catchy I kind of like it too :P U-KISS Songs Man Man Ha Ni & DORA DORA:  Spoiler

 So the spoilers contain a youtube vid. I'll fix it at some point if necessary if that's not allowed to be on the safe side and not overload you all... if it's not in spoilers i just provided a link instead. BAP I love these guys. So.. the vid I just provided is awesome for so many reasons. Beat, lyrics, choreography, and the vid actually tells a story. Quite literally this may very well be an epic-esque music video. If you like that vid, you should also check out their song "Power"  Spoiler Yoon Mi Rae Two of my fave songs by her. Actually everything of hers is a fave. The first has a nice soulful beat in the background. And it's lovely. The second is Quention Tarantino gone music video director. the third I added cause I just couldn't help it.  Spoiler  Spoiler  Spoiler G.Na I like a large majority of her stuff. I'm still in the "how many times can I hear this before I wanna go death" phase for some of her songs. Erm... If you like that song.... check out "Bitter Day" and "Already Miss You"  Spoiler Hyuna I like the sound of her voice and her stage presence for the most part. Actually her stage presence isn't on the best display here. And her guest outshined her as far as I can see. Oh well. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RICAogd7UI TVXQ/DBSK (oh jeez I love them so much) They're probably he most well rounded all around boy band in existence. No doubt because of the revolving line up. Though they do dance, I cannot imagine anyone watches these vids for the choreography.  Spoiler Kahi Stumbled upon this by accident when I was going through a message from a friend to youtube something. It's bit more poppy than what I prefer but it's pretty hard to not like I think. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g59-f4Rj2cw Park Yijoon Just posting this because I've been listening to her for years and this is probably one of my fave songs by her and the vid has a somber mood to it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8PPzMr188M Lee Min Woo I have loved this him since before his solo career and before his stint in the military. That is all.  Spoiler N.EX.T A rock band. Pretty much they're kinda like the Red Hot Chili Peppers in that their music covers a wide range of genres. Namely funk, metal, and maybe a bit of synth pop. I'm a sucker for instrumentals so their diverse sound really makes happy. Enjoy. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqwdkkWqjpw Rania This one is for any one listening to kpop to see the choreography. That sounds kinda odd actually considering they aren't exactly lax over there regarding keeping things as pg as possible in music videos. Idk.  Spoiler 
Should've opted out just before the point of ejaculation b1tch. ~ Snap 
 @chica, i only found out about G.Na like 2 days ago, I love that song. And DBSK is Jap.
