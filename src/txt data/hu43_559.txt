[Adventure] Shinsekai Yori
 About one thousand years into the future, civilization has been retrograded and humans are living dispersed within small communities. People in this era have a psychic power called “Juryoku” which materializes things they imagine. In the absence of advanced scientific technology, people are using this power as a major source of energy. One day, a girl called Saki, along with her friends, finds a small archive robot outside the town. It records the ancient history of humans. It tells them that Juryoku was found in the 21st century and the discovery caused a world war between psychics and non-psychics. The psychics won this war and thus their reign of terror began. When the adults in town figure out that the children discovered this forbidden knowledge, they seal their Juryoku and exile them. Saki and the others end up in a forest where they meet a huge hairless bipedal mouse known as a “Bakenezumi” and get involved in a violent war the creatures are currently engaged in. Interesting first episode to say the least...we'll see how this plays out.

 Definitely going to take a look at this later tonight looks promising to say the least. 
 ERMMAHGERD. I saw the preview on Crunchyroll, but I didn't know when it begins to air! I shall go watch it NAO! 
 It sounds like a interesting show. 
 I'll give it a shot probably! 

 Why does this show remind me of Children of the Corn?

 Well I gave it a shot but since two episodes ago I have dropped this one, good thing I did cause I saw some snapshots from the latest episode which disappoint me.

 This show is actually quite amazing. It gets very deep, and it's one of those shows where you kinda have to pay attention, otherwise many things will fly right over your head. I'd say give it to about the 4th episode, your attention span has to be there lol. Not to mention, I personally enjoy the animation. I really do recommend this show, the story is great, and very original. I cannot wait for the next episode, because they're older and I haaavve to know what happens >__< 

 ill probobly give it a look see after awhile.

 This past episode was so good! I really want to know what's happened to Shun. Plus the gang meets the Cat!

Not sure how to go about telling you what the anime is like...maybe like a darker Higurashi and more serious.

Compared to Sword Art Online, The tones in this show are way deeper, and in my personal opinion the overall story is on a much deeper level. You have to pay attention to this show, or you'll miss crucial details. Things can easily fly over your head, but there is great action, although, it can feel rather slow at times. Where as in Sword Art Online I feel like you could maybe miss an episode or two and still be alright, but if your miss an episode of this show, you'll be lost. This show has great moments of where when you finally understand something, or you make a connection of the explanations to the characters, it'll make you go " Ohhhh my god! So that's why they are like thiss!!" Moments like that. I enjoy them. I feel like if you like Neon Genesis Evangelion, Paranoia Agent, Witch Hunter Robin, You'll like this show.

 Up to episode 10, a little to much yaoi, and yuri for my tastes, but a decent anime all around. I like the story overall, but they seem to change the animation a little to much for my tastes.

 I'm still not sure what to make of this show....I'm up to date with it(outside of the episode that came out this week) Some weeks it looks incredibly interesting again, others it leaves me confused as to what I'm watching... 
 Ughhh This show is sooo good! >__< Why isin't there many people talking about this?! This passed episode was amazing. I love the history behind this society!

I know right?! I started watching and it lost me for like episodes 2 and 3 but I hung in there and I love it!

Isin't it sad that they can't remember Shun yet?! they call him "X" OH and I'm sooo glad they found Mamoru! Omg and when Saki was talking to the head of the Ethics committee, the story about the ogre boy was so interesting, it's no wonder the adults are all cautious when it comes to the kids. I think it's so crazy how Saki's sister was terminated. Omg and the fact that Shun turned into a Karmic demon is crazzy. I'm so glad they knew that Shuns replacement was not their original partner! 

 BUMP. OMG why aren't we talking about this diamond of a show ;__; ugh.. Soo good...
