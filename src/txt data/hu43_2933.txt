 I want to ask a question for those who love exercise.
 Well I workout 5 days a week on my lacrosse team and I sweat a ton normally. Sometimes I'll sweat when I'm just lifting weights in the weight room. So yeah i sweat all the time and I won't be tired in the slightest. Considering though I'm a type one diabetic so I do get more tired then most people due to blood sugar problems. The other day for example I ran 4 miles and I was sweating like crazy but I wasn't really tired at all. I think personally though I'm just a heavy sweater
