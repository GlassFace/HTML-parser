 [EVENT] Site banners
 Dimensions: are 1000 x 200 Theme: Spring 2014 anime Format: Jpeg. - There is no point in uploading massive png files to the site as they take too long to load. Theme: Again, You may submit a banner of any anime that you want, but I am looking for banners of 2014 anime for the spring season for the next rotation to keep it current. Staff will choose the best 20 or so (more if we have a high standard) and they will all be put up in the next rotation. Please use the bannerage sticky to look for advice on new banners if you feel you need some help rather than posting 100 versions in here. XD. People are usually pretty helpful. Good luck!
