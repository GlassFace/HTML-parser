 Favorite Mystery Anime?
 I love Detective Conan. I saw the dub, but I was not a big fan of it. As for the original, I kinda dropped it after episode 680+, which was when the fillers started to really bore me. It became like this generic shounen anime where stuff happens for the sake of stuff happening, and there was very little plot-progression and character development. I prefer the old version of the anime though, where there's a lot more drama and suspense with the black organization and Ran's heartaches. The fourth movie is definitely my favorite one, since it has tons of character development in that one. I also remember watching Detective School Q. I liked that anime as a kid. Then there was also the live action Kindaichi J-drama. I've also seen the Liar Game live action J-drama a while ago; I quite liked that one.
