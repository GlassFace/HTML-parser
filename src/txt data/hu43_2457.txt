 Haruki Murakami Fans?
 Hey! Is anyone here a fan of Murakami's works? I started buying his books one by one (because the cover art is beautiful, at least on the copies available at bookstores in my region). They're a bit expensive for me, but so worth it. My boyfriend and a few of my friends are large fans of his work. If you like him, what's your favourite book by him and what do you recommend? I have quite a few of his books already. My favourite is probably Kafka on the Shore.
