 A Hard Platformer Game?
 The hardest platform adventure iv'e played to date is ~~~~~(IWBTG) I Wanna Be The Guy~~~~~ is a sardonic loveletter to the halcyon days of early American videogaming, packaged as a nail-rippingly difficult platform adventure. Players fill the role of The Kid, a youthful, vaguely Megaman-esque protagonist on a quest to become The Guy This game is worthy enough to rage at....... just saying!

 Uncharted is crazy difficult on crushing mode, although the difficulty more or less isn't the platform parts. They can get tough though. Cat Mario isn't hard at all, don't see why people rage so much at it xD I actually laughed through the game. Guess that's just who I am though. Does Closure count as a platform game? If so, that for sure.

 Original Ghosts n' Goblins was a genuine pain back in the day. 2 hits and you die.

 platformers are normallyeasy for me but i guess the hardest one would be sly thieves in time i beat it in 2 weeks which doesnt sound like much but i beet the first sly game in a day. sly theives in time is the first game in years that got me breaking my own stuff it's mostly because of bad motion controls onsome missions though.

 Super Meat Boy or Ms. Splosion Man *cries* 
 Ghosts n' Goblins Put me down for the Arcade version of this. I think the furthest I ever got was watching the freeplay demo. The home version was slightl;y more do-able but still hard as nails. The person who decided to use semi realistic physics regarding jumping/momentum in this game was a twisted genius. I mean psychopath. ~~~~~(IWBTG) I Wanna Be The Guy~~~~~ More of a memorization excersise than skill. Yes, its infuriatingly hard. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Super Meat Boy comes to mind firstly. And the first Crash Bandicoot was hard for me as a kid because of the controls not being as tight as they could have been. 
 Yes, then more deaths and more and more until you just quit the game

 Did anyone ever try the 30 challenges in Perfect Dark on N64 took me years to beat it 

 To all the people above that said Super Meat Boy... I have to agree. I wanna be the Guy is just one of unfair gameplay. Meat Boy on the other hand shows what you need to do and laughs at you for constantly missing that jump or landing on those spikes.
