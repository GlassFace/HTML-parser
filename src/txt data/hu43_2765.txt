 Would you say the area you live in is dangerous?
 After looking around the PLD and saw topics like how do you defend yourself. I've decided to ask, is the are you live in dangerous? Although I consider my area dangerous, its probably because of my experiences. People have tried to mug me 8 times within the last 3 years. 4 of which they had weapons. I've been shot at by gang members once last year. So idk if I would call the area I live in super dangerous or I'm just at the wrong place at the wrong time kind of thing. It definitely is dangerous to go out alone or have your phone out in some cases though in my area for sure. But that's probably due to where I go and hangout. So is the area where you live dangerous to go out alone? 
When they see me rollin. They hatein.
