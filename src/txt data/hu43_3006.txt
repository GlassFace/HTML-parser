 Why haven't you clicked here yet Senpai? <3
 First off, stay away from Naruto, seriously, I watched some of it and became very bored with it fast, I just don't get the appeal of this series. I seen your anime list ,you would probably like Space Adventure Cobra. I don't see Uresei Yatsura on that list-you should watch it, it is much better than Naruto, (yech!!!). , and if you seen and liked My Bride's A Mermaid you might like Uresei Yatsura!!!. If you like something like Midori Days then you might like Akikan. I'm sorry your list is kinda hard to read. I don't know what dropped means exactly but Rozen Maiden and Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne are really good. I might check out Skip Beat, Bamboo Blade, Hikaru No Go, Mysterious Girlfriend X, Please Teacher and Please! Twins, Ah My Goddess, Zatch Bell, Cardcaptor Sakura, Yuushiba, Daa Daa Daa, maybe a fantasy idol anime like Creamy Mami or Full Moon Wo Sagashite. As for Naruto, there are hundreds of episodes of that series and after a while, like the Simpsons, it can get old.
