 Could you suggest some person transformation animes?
 I would like suggestions for animes where the characters are transformed some how. I don't necessarily want human to robot type ones if there are any - unless it's to a human type android and not a robocop/iron man all metal type one. Specifically something along the line of ranma 1/2 or kampfer. Also size changes would be welcome too - big to small, small to big, anything like that. If it's a mind transfer that's ok too - it doesn't have to be a full body transfer. Thanks. Edit - oh and I mean the actual person changes, not machinery like transformers nor robotech with the planes transforming, not that. Edit 2 - I think I'll pass on suggestions for magical girl transformation ones in this request - that is an entirely separate category from what I'm asking for here. (ie where the girl turns into the super heroin - kampfer is different in that the guy turns into the magical girl) Edit 3 - oh and I've watched cinderella boy so that one I know about.
