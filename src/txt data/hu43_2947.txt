[Drama] Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April)
 The Osanajimi is still being annoying and selfish, big surprise. Why is Goku so upset, his little Tsundere Loli sister is now involved because he's got angst. Even Watari understands that Blondie prefers Kousei, props to him for admitting it. Dude, it's a race against time now...how the hell did a 14-year old get himself into this situation - all the more wisdom and resolve if he gets past it and wears the memories like trophies. "Walking Hard On" oh my goodness what a line for a teenager girl to say. Now he's the Sadist Tsundere Loli's inspiration? Heavy rain at the end, I tried to make a videogame joke but couldn't because Blondie looked pretty damn sad. Things are winding up, although I do feel that the plot has derailed a bit to a new, complex direction that I'm not really liking. 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils?
