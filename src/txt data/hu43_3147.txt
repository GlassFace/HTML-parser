 Started an online community that I can not cope with any longer.
 I love Asian entertainment. And since I can understand both Japanese & Korean. I decided a few years ago (2010) to start finding great movies from the Japanese & Korean world, sub them and up their quality to 1080p and pump out better graphics than any others on websites such as YouTube, mega, putlocker, etc. Back then I had nothing to do, and didn't dream of it actually taking off. But just my last video on YouTube hit 130,000 hits today and my Facebook has over 9,000 demanding followers. I've been considering to pull the plug for a while, especially as I started doing gaming on the same channel, I have to balance subbing and uploading quality movies, be an entertaining gamer AND focus on my personal life (Which is friends & work). Any comments on where you guys think I should turn? I considered some help but I don't know many who can sub a clean movie or have the video editing experience as I do. And for me this is exhausting and takes a great pull on my life, I receive probably 50 requests per week for movies and even more for games.
