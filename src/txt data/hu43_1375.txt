And then there's Pikachu, who I doubt will get any complaints regarding its cry.

 I beat the 3rd gym and unlocked Mega Evolution not long ago, so I took Mega Blastoise for some epic armcannon madness. That **** is fun as hell. Right now my team is Delphox, (Mega) Blastoise, Doublade, Pidgeot which I will switch out once something interesting comes along and Helioptile which I will also switch out when something interesting comes along. Not really digging the Electric/Normal typing. As for Pidgeot, my flying type will be Noivern once I get my hands on it. The 6th slot... I'm going to try and get back Flabebe as soon as possible. Damn Metapod. 
 
 Just made it to Snowbelle City and im figuring out what i have to do so i can fight the 8th gym leader. Beating down on Team Flare was awesome but really easy. The cut scenes around that time were pretty freakin sweet too. Right now my party is: Lv 62 Scolipede Lv 62 Charizard Lv 62 Garchomp Lv 62 Lucario Lv 63 Gogoat Lv 63 Greninja

 Played 12 hours, not even at the second gym. Spending so much time breeding and trading. Here's a progress update on the origin of species: Eeveelution -have male & female japanese Eevee at daycare on route 7 -have several lvl 1 Eevee of varying natures -traded for a fletchinder with flame body hopefully this will catalyze egg hatching -have both Sylveon, and Umbreon -takes a ton of effort to get the eeveelutions that require happiness/affection -should have an Espeon within a day -need to find out where I can get the stones for the other eeveelutions -need to find locations that permit Glaceon/Leafeon evolution current party is: Solrock lvl27 Clauncher lvl 29 Umbreon lvl 13 Sylveon lvl 14 Butterfree lvl 24 and an Eevee I'm working on evolving into an Espeon

Ice rock for Glaceon is after the Sixth badge, and the moss rock you won't be seeing until after you've defeated team flare, right before the eighth gym. Sorry broski. On a lighter note, you can get Thunder, Water, and Fire stones at a shop in Lumiose city for 2100P a pop. : )

 I found out that my Honedge evolves in one more level lol. Level 35. I also need to get my hands on a Dusk Stone to evolve it into an Aegislash.

 Does anyone know where to get Venipede (or one of his evolutions) at the earliest moment? I beat the 3rd gym yesterday and just did a bit of wonder trade training (traded my 32 Helioptile, got a level 2 Fletchling that I quickly leveled to 25 and put in the wonder trade as well, which got me a level 9 Pancham in return which I'll just exp share level for the time being until wonder trading that one) I remember giving Scolipede a whirl in Black 2 and it was a beast. Would be awesome to have it on my team again. Aside from that.. Dusk Stone where art thou? *wants Aegislash*

 I got my Venipede on the main path on route 6, he jumps out of the bushes so you might have to wait for a minute. Just defeated team flare. Also realized that Yveltal had type advantage over half of my team, so I resorted to getting my Delphox to spam Calm Mind for a few turns. My team as of now is; Scolipede level 55 (to **** on fairies) Blastoise level 55 (because I didn't want Venusaur) Sliggo level 55 (yes I know how to make him evolve, it's a pain) Pidgeot level 55 (boring I know, but he's the first pokemon I caught and he knows return, so he's staying) Pangoro level 56 (probably my favorite 6th poke ^^) Delphox level 57 (I called her Taomon... only Jellz will get it >.>)

 Thanks Struggler & Green Bird. I'll keep it in mind and wait till I can use Fly to go back there. Rather just progress with the story for the time being. Maybe I'll be able to find Toxic somewhere before getting Venipede. That'd be handy dandy.

I was upset that you could only get Glaceon/Leafeon in another game, and so my dream remained incomplete. I guess I could always try and trade for a Leaf/Glaceon, but it wouldn't be the same as raising it from an egg to seeing it evolve... 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 What with Eevee being able to be caught in the wild for a change, I imagine what you're trying to do is at least a little easier than it was in the past. Anyway, so I finally saw mega Gengar in-game, and it's pretty hideous. I saw an image of a supposed mega Gengar prerelease, but all the comments on the picture were claiming it was fake, so I wasn't sure if it was real or not. Sadly, it was, and that ugly picture of an alleged mega Gengar was in fact an image of the real, ugly, mega Gengar. I am disappoint. *removes Gengarite*

 I like how the story part with AZ and the ultimate weapon is almost a complete ripoff of Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood.

 So I found out Mega Gyarados is a thing because I was looking at where to find Garchompite and stumbled upon a whole guide that shows the locations of all the mega stones. It didn't, however, say it's only available in X or Y so I'm hoping it's for both versions. Would love to take Mega Garchomp for a spin, but if it's not possible so be it. Right now I'm at the 5th gym with no pokemon that's really good against electric except for Gabite. But he's only at 33 atm so.. yeah... Totally doing this with Delphox and Doublade. 
 
 Now have: Espeon Umbreon Sylveon awwww yeahhh

 Haha RPing teams is pretty fun. My favourite one was the guy in the anime who had 5 ninjasks and a shedinja.
