 Signature & Avatar Workshop v.3 (READ FIRST POST - Requests Only)
 Avi & Sig Request Image: http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/i/20...rt-d5ptqzx.png Colours: Whatever Fits. Size: I'm not good with sizes so i'd say, general Avi & sig sizes. Your choice. Text: (Only on signature) I would love the quote "Because.. I was called a Genius." and "Neji195" somewhere in the corner Extra: I would really like if you could get rid of the general text in the picture. It's the same text i want but it looks sloppy like that. Other than that, Thank You to whoever helps me out with this. 
 Â Spoiler Everyone Believes in me and calls me a Genius. Thats the reason why I Cannot Lose. ~Genius Originally posted by FROIDBUSTER It's nights like these that I wish we still had tinychat and Neji. Originally posted by ^_Elysium_^ You know he's a Genius right? You think locks can stop that schlong? Originally posted by ^_Elysium_^ Exactly, all you social inepts need to become Neji.
