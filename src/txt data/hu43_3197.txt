 Hello manimes and womanimes
 Greetings hello am henk yes. This is first post, salutations. I wish to live animu life and engage in anime discussions, as to what is best anime, how to care for anime, what erotic soaps are favorable to anime. Favorite anime girl is rei, as she is best girl. Hideaki "hot whip" anoo was sure in the money when he birthed he from the loans of his mind. Name henk, formerly known as alfboi1994 on airwolf fans forum, rip, in case there are any airfans in this wakcy japanese house, call me henk or "big sugar" if need be. Dreams in life? To moot nice otaku girl who will wash my filthy eels and vote for ron paul in the forseeable future. Really anyone willing to platonically wash eels is fine aas they are dirty and becoming agitated. Thank you. "rei and hungry mans- that is some good ****" -thomas jefferson
