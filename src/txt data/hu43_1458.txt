 I like how Shiroe's plans seems to be peaceful as. and as always, Akatsuki is so kawaii

 Atsuki in cute dresses is even kawaii more. :3

 Yeah the writers have just done a good job setting the tone without being really melodramatic or just kinda goofy and dumb. The characters feel like the focus of the plot instead of OH MY GOD TRAPPED IN A GAME AAAAAAAAA kinda thing. 

 Yeah, the whole respawn when you are dead made it a bit different.

 Well it's more that the problems and conflicts set up so far have been player created, essentially. It's very human problems as opposed to ones imposed by the game or the company/person running the game. As in, the whole PVPers being horrible jerks and setting themselves up as raiders around the major cities is entirely a player created situation that was able to be resolved through player intervention. Or more recently, the exp potion farming going on; again a player created situation (thanks in part to the games mechanics) that was able to be resolved through players themselves intervening. Very man vs man conflicts as opposed to man vs nature that we got in a show like SAO with the floor bosses and permadeath. It helps to humanize all of the characters involved, because it's very easy to see how people stuck in a situation like this might react in the ways they have; both the positive and the negatice reactions. It's obviously terrible but completely understandable to see why people might group up to gank people they think they can beat in order to horde better equipment/money/whatever resources they can. Likewise, forcing newer players into your guild and farming them for exp potions is terrible from a morality standpoint but rational and lucrative from a business perspective with the raised level cap. But again, they're situations created by the players themselves which makes them much more interesting than something like the game mechanics creating a barrier for the players. The raid boss fights in SAO were certainly interesting but they weren't particularly compelling. Nor was the rogue AI or really any of the poorly explained plot in the .Hack series all that engaging realistically. Those shows relied on the suspense created by being trapped in the game and perma-death. 

 And there are cat people, Ian. Cat. People.

 That Shiroe has a shrewd way of using his ninja loli! o_o

 I'm loving all these negotiations and allegiance of guilds. It shows that the MC can be cool doing other things too, rather than fighting.

 I approve of Shiroe's ways! best way to use Akatsuki indeed!

 Amazing, been following this one along with Kill a Kill, but I gotta say Log Horizon has been one of the better series I have seen these few years. It has a very mature feeling towards it, not the usual cliche nonsense and with an actual likeable male protagonist. Definitely looking to see more of this. 
 "Create your dream, live your dream, be your dream"
 So there's a side-manga featuring the West Wind Brigade guild (Soujirou and his friends, who were featured in a recent episode) that's been covering some of the stuff going on in Akiba immediately after the Apocalypse; learning about resurrection existing in the world, etc. that's pretty decent. Only a couple chapters out so far, but might be worth googling if ya like the show. 

 Shiroe rules. buying the entire freaking building haha. His motive is pretty awesome too, you know I'd expect something like escaping the game being his priority .

 Shiroe is such a bad ass he mostly looks like Ovan from .hack except he don't have that giant lock on his arm. Him buying the whole building like a BOSS. x'D 
 Woah that ending though! I like the direction this is going!

 That moment when you've been playing a game for almost 9 years. Dayum Shiroe.

 Man, I logged into YPP for the first time in a year or so and got my 9th Jolly Roger badge, meaning I've been playing that game for 9+ years. D: Time flies! Anywho, great episode I've been loving the political intrigue in the show and the People of the Lands interest in the steam engine ships should be a good storyline. Also real curious about this elf looking dude showing up and dropping plot bombs.
