[Site] What Youtube channels do you watch?
 I don't watch many channels, but the ones I watch, I watch religiously. Markiplier: Video game playthroughs that are genuinely funny, entertaining, and sometimes, moving. Watch his review and playthrough of Presentable Liberty and tell me you weren't moved like he was at the end of it. League of Super Critics: Allows me to watch reviews like the Cinema Snob, MikeJ, and others in a manner where I can skip the skit crap when it appears, although I do enjoy the skits by MikeJ and the Cinema Snob, but only because those guys are funny in almost everything they do. Seriously, why do so many review people do stupid skits in their review videos? And any other videos I watch are usually just random and without reason. I really need to get the videos on my channel out. But school and work have me strapped for time. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
