[Anime] Top 7 anime on the forum
 Why are the top seven anime on the forum valvrave of the liberator s2, kill la kill, pokemon origins, kyoukai no kanata, ippo s3, space dandy, and samurai flamenco? I mean some are good anime but some are far from it. Also I would thought the new season anime would be at the top. I really just don't understand that.
