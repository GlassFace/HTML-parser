 Japanese Candy Subscription?? Advice/experiences?
 I don't have any experience with any but I did just order my husband a 6 month subscription to skoshbox for xmas. They are by far the cheapest box, just over $10. The others are in the $20 range. I do believe skoshbox is having an xmas special where you can order 3 months. Can give it a try without spending too much money or having to cancel the subscription. Though I can guarantee all the boxes are much more expensive for the items than just buying them outright at the store. But there's the fun of surprise and sampling. Plus there isn't the inconvenience of hauling myself to the asian grocery market.
