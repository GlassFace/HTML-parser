 Bluray & Anime

Mostly because I have a shitty sound system to begin with. I suppose if you have a really nice 5.1 sounds system, bluray anime might be worth it. Or maybe not. I'd have to try DVD and Bluray on anime on 5.1 and compare. THEN try to see if the price difference is worth the sound quality. More research needed.
