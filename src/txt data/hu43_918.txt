[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Just don't take it too seriously! It's a really damn silly series for the most part, with a lot of tongue in cheek jokes poking fun at code geass, gundam, etc. It's not just a parody, but those elements really stand out as it goes on, especially several of the characters.
