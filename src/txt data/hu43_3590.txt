 Vegeta vs Hulk!
 I think Vegeta's abilities deserves some clarification. He is supposedly able to destroy planets but is never shown to do anywhere near that much damage to the landscape or otherwise. It could be because they are holding back, because they are controlling their powers to keep it localized, or it could just be because of bad writing. It is all theory. However, it is not theory that Vegeta can in fact destroy planets because this fact has been explained and quantified in the canon material. It takes 300 Kili to destroy a planet. SSJ Goku has over 3000, but Goku and Vegeta were fighting in SSJ2 form toward the end, which is canonically stronger than the SSJ1 form. Since Vegeta won that fight, it is really unquestionable that he has more than the 300 Kili necessary to destroy planets. Anyone want to do calculations for how much energy it takes to blow up a planet? It is never explained in the anime or manga why he is never shown with that kind of output even though his power has been relatively quantified, but unless there is canonical reason explaining why he cannot do it, he does not have to show that he can do it thanks to the fact mentioned above. Claiming that he does not have that kind of power without any evidence to disqualify the established numbers is the actual theory here, and Vegeta not having been shown to destroy a planet is lack of evidence, not evidence against. It is no different from people feeling certain that you would melt if you go too close to the sun based on the temperature calculations alone even though no one has actually gone to the sun to put their hand on it and say, "oh look, my hand is melting." Now if people want to argue whether or not he is competent enough to use that kind of power against the Hulk, then go all out.
