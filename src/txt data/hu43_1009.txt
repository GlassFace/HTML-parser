 ^I find other characters like Ino more dis-likable than Sakura in Naruto. Anyways, for me it's Inoue Orihime from Bleach ... ugh ... such a terrible character >-<

 definally hated all the side characters from dragon ball z. I always wanted people to fight when i was a teen, because they interrupted the fights all the time and showed what bulma krilin and this old man always do which was useless. I also hated conan, hes annoying smart aleck. I always wanted his uncle to explain the stuff for once. Thats why i never liked the series. 
 sakura hands down 
 When people bring up DBZ, I always go to Hercule when describing a most detested character. He was always useless, in every sense of the word. I know, I know. The Kai planet and the wish in the Majin Buu Saga. But really? Come on, anytime the camera phased to this guy, you knew you were f'ucked with useless whining, false bravado, and just an all around awful character with an even worse personality. For me? It was Koda and his incestual cousin from Elfen Lied. Half way through the series, I wanted them to both die painful deaths. I've seen it subbed and dubbed, and neither can be saved in either circumstance. But good pick on the person who singled out Orihime from Bleach. But she was beyond annoying before the Hueco Mundo arc. Ooh, Kagome from Inuyasha is another staple damsel in distress who can't stop yelling the name of the hero and its show in one breath. 
Individual Eleven: Rise Up. Never conform. 
 Pretty much everyone in Hetalia. That show gives anime a bad name. Those characters are all despicable. 
 Minerva from Fairy Tail. I hate her a lot. 
 If you ever fall in love with another girl.. I wouldn't be able to live on! 
 Cal (after she grew up)from Requiem for the phantom. i actually skipped around the episodes because of her.

 Oberon from SAO...he was basically a middle-aged man dressing as a prissy butterfly and screaming like a prepubescent teen boy, that every time he screamed or the scene where he goes "KAYABA!" I start cracking up so much

 I have to say another one. Yuka from 11 eyes!  Spoiler when she awakened her power, she became self - centered and jelous. she even tried to hurt misuzu! Unacceptable!!!
