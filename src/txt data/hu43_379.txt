 What are you currently Playing? - Page 57
 AC Unity currently. I'm only on the third mission though!

 Unity is a piece of sh*t. My roommate heard that they rushed it and there are so many glitches that the game is worthless until the patches come out. I'm waiting on my new PS3 to be delivered so I can play Persona 4 Arena Ultimax. Next month, Guilty Gear Xrd comes out (I am so excited!!).

I've actually read there are frame rate issues on the ps4 however.

 I'm loving ac unity. Ac black flag was a great ride. This is another great ride. The character animations are superb. The reality of revolutionary France is astonishing. Rooms have artwork! Its just so immersive. Great music too. I'm really enjoying this. And I'm glad to report I haven't seen any graphical glitches or slowdowns. Magnefique!!!

 Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus (PS Vita) Nice game, with some Naruto and Ikki-tousen influences...it's funny, echi and kinda hack and slash...but the replay value stays high cause of the collectables...decent story and nice graphics...I like it 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 I'm insane. I just bought assassins creed rogue for the ps3. I have no idea when I'll play it. But its basically a black flag sequel so that'll be loads of fun. I also picked up the unity collectors edition strategy guide. I love the artwork and the detailed bios they give. I did use my GameStop reward points for them. So I didn't pay full price.

 Currently giving Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning a second chance. The gameplay overall reminds me of the Fable series which, I was a fan of back in time. Here's a trailer of it, oh and it is singleplayer:  Spoiler Edit: I gave it 10 hours, after that I grew bored of it... NEXT!

 I just finished the tomb raider definitive edition on my Xbox one about twenty minutes ago. Got 75% complete on normal (meaning all the side activities and collections and stuff) The ending was OK. Pretty satisfying if not wholly unexpected. Though  Spoiler you do finally get to see Lara use dual pistols but in only in the last cut scene - you do get to fire them but in a rail gun fashion). All in all I highly recommend the game. It has great action and platforming. It has enough collecting and looting to keep packrats and ocd people busy. Go buy it now!

 Just finished up episode two of D4. I had a really good time playing through the first episode a few months back, and while I did enjoy the second as well, I gotta say I thought it was way too short. Hopefully Access Games will sort out some more episodes in the coming months, but I guess only time will tell.

 I've been playing a lot of Sims 4, Don't Starve, and Civilization V on PC. xD And on PS3, I've been slowly making my way through the Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD edition. Out of OCD I've been trying to get 100%, and learn all abilities on dresspheres on FFX-2. x_X I'm kind of waiting until the steam Christmas sales so I can purchase Telltales Game of Thrones, at a discount, if it gets discounted. 
 I've started playing Red Faction: Armageddon (PS3), I just completed Chapter 12: Older Enemies.

 I finally got back to halo the master chief collection on the one. Now they've got multiplayer patched its the way it should have been at launch. There's something therapeutic about blowing up anything that moves .

 Heavy Rain and Deadly Premonition... making me want to play more horror games again... 
 I also spent some time with shadows of mordor again. The combats great. The group battling okays a lot like the arkham games which is a good thing.

 Playing Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and Guilty Gear Xrd on PS3. AW is sort of glitchy and laggy on multiplayer, but if they manage to fix that it'll be an OK game. Although I might just buy Black Ops 2 back until the servers get taken down. Guilty Gear is pretty good and the story was amazing.

 I'm glad somebody else posted. I'm halfway through tales of xillia now! (I did buy some xp upgrades on psn to get to level 30ish). I had a few hours in before my ps3 fat died earlier this year (yep no backups). I just love the tales of games!!

 Just finished the first episode of Game of Thrones by telltale. Quite a slow start comparecompared to the walking dead, but towards the end started to show promise. About to start Murdered: Soul Suspect. Wanted to play it for a while, so I'm pretty interested to see what it's like. 
 I just finished playing Civ 5. The AI made me angry when they proposed a research agreement but I had to give up most of my resources, 1/3 of my gold, and then pay them more gold every turn. -.-" To make a long story short, their cities are mine now

 I've got a few games on the docket at the moment. I believe the next up will be... Shadow Of Destiny (Playstation 2) I played, probably about a third of the game early last year, but I ended up sidetracked and didn't get to finish it. As a result, I'll be restarting the game, and playing it over the next few days. Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires is also out later this month, and frankly, if past experiences count for anything, I expect to drop everything else and play that for days on end. EDIT: Actually, Wikipedia, and IGN reported it to be out on the 27th, but it isn't actually out until late next month, so... curses.
