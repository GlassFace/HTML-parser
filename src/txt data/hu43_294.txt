 It's a shame Quantic had to use level 21 accounts but, even so, they made many plays that were questionable anyway. I think they would've lost if they had the full level 30 accounts also. This was kind of an issue with the lower level accounts. The other teams would get called ****-tier if they got beat and Quantic would get the "oh they didn't have level 30 accounts" as an excuse for losing. They got outplayed in just about every aspect. Locodoco was honestly not that great and their jungler/mid got outplayed hard. Forgot about the other two so can't say much about them. But hey, at least they know the competition they're up against now. They'll need to work a bit harder and get ready for next time. Originally Posted by Pured Rofl.

But my team rages and starts **** talking me before game starts, so to me, they deserve a loss. I like to get a nice score early, and give them hope, then not help them and if they lose, too bad.

 ^^^ Ur attitude is shitty and I hope you get banned multiple times. This is a cool video about player behavior. http://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The...Shaping-Player One part that does suck about it/I don't like...is when they show graphs with no numerical value. He shows games over time and funny graphs that support his "thought experiment" with no concrete values or anything to really show and prove. At least that's as far as I know, I could have missed a part.

 IDK, if Pured is Gold like he says, then I'm Challenger tier material.

 That Lego video... you know what, that was cool as hell. I wonder how many unique frames were taken. Really, well done.

 Yeah this has been predictable so far, yawn. 

 Faker is OP. .  Spoiler 
Sand Cats are Bloody Adorable. 
 Faker should rename himself Baker cause he just cooked some lemon tarts.

Still a sick play though. I love that about Ahri. If you so much as tickle their anus, their health bar turns into a hot red mess.

Vi was the 2nd tankest on their team so an Ahri burst (even with DFG) on a Vi is pretty impressive to me. I play Ahri (landing charm = kill >) but i can not melt tanks quite that well, unless i'm really ahead, and since these are pros to be ahead enough to do that is impressive. Faker OP

 Ahri nuking a vi with 1 combo... Am I reading that correctly? Will have to watch that video when I get home... Why don't people play veigar?

 Ugh, those Fnatic picks... what the **** were they thinking? Everything Doublelift said was 100% correct.

 Tri Force buffs are ruining bot lane in this Tournament. Corki so far in 7/7 games, with only one loss (on GamingGear.eu, doesn't really count).

 Vulcun putting up a valiant effort until Singed simply got too tanky and mancloud started tilting on all those fights in river near dragon. Just some really dumb engages showing how much trouble NA handles the Korean teamfighting style. They aren't good at adapting and switching targets, and rotating their own members as they get low.

The funniest part was the irony in the statement "Faker Senpai." One's Chinese, one's Korean, but we're going with Japanese because we can. Close second was the pun "You can not a'Voidle' him." Close second. Still want to punch him for using that pun.

 Awwww, both the Teams I'm routing for Lost one Match, Ozone & SKT Though Least OMG was the one who beat SKT.

 I'm glad Gambit Gaming managed to beat Ozone. The Korean circlejerk is too much sometimes. Hope Gambit Gaming beat Fnatic today, the Vulcan match will be fun too. Hey, all the matches will be fun! But yeah, TSM still need to step up their game. I don't even think I've seen a game where Reginald has played Fizz successfully so I don't know why he continues to pick him. Also I am now Platinum 2. Platinum 1 here I come!
