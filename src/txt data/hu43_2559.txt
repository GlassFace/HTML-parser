[Anime] Name your favorite manga that made a horrible anime
 I always hear, and read people talking about how the manga of certain series are so much better than the anime. So I thought I would make a post. Name your favorite manga that made a horrible anime... or at least a bad anime

 Blade of the Immortal comes to mind. 

 Black Butler. I saw the anime first but read the manga afterwards. They are COMPLETELY different, the manga is so much better! Not to mention the 2nd season of the anime was completely made up! I don't think I'll ever go back to watching the anime unless they start following the manga. :/

I don't think I'll ever go back to watching the anime unless they start following the manga. :/ I have only read two volumes of the Black Butler manga, but it's nearly identical to the first few episodes of the anime. I am not sure when it exactly it diverges from the manga. Anyway, you will be interested to know that they are planning to adapt an arc of the manga into an anime. I think it involves the circus...er, something like that. 
 Id have to say the anime adaptation of Elfen Lied. Compared to its manga, it lacks SO much material. Even though it doesnt fully count, Mekaku City Actors compared to its manga adaptation under the title of Kagerou Days... And Ive heard from some that the anime for Kanokon sucked! And because of what happened to Elfen Lied, I think Ill stay away from the anime adaptation of Kanokon...

 Well Deadman's Wonderland. The anime was total garbage...and the blood in the anime looked more like ketchup than actually blood. And they took out so much of the characters from the anime which helped to give the manga a unique feel.

I'll admit that the anime was okay at first, but it just got stupider, and stupider, and stupider. I might watch the new one that's coming out, but I don't have my hopes very high. @Joanro: After Prince Soma and Agni come in, I think that's when the manga and anime really go their separate ways. But there were little differences throughout too. 
 high school of the dead anime ended too quickly compared to the manga version

Oh cool I didn't know that! Hm maybe I'll give it another shot then. The circus arc was pretty interesting. Hey if you liked the anime I think you would probably like the manga a lot better. Its only similar in the beginning but it gets completely different as it progresses. There's more depth to the characters and in one part they're actually fighting zombies on a cruise ship. It's pretty awesome. @Blue Star xD Yeah I'm probably going to watch it too but I'm not expecting it to be great. They'll probably just make it dumb or change a bunch of stuff. :/ 
 I loved the manga version of Shaman King, but didn't enjoy the anime, I only watched maybe half way through the series. I found even though it followed the storyline it didn't really feel right (maybe the way they animated it, but I don't know just wasn't enjoyable to watch)

 For afanofJapan : Didn't know that Shaman King was different. You teach me something Herf...Pandora Hearts.. but only for the lastest episodes. Gensomaden Saikyuki but because of the animation. The two first seasons are a bit...poor. When you compare the manga and the anime you say "but does realisator hate this manga?" And the worst of all time : Samurai Deeper Kyo. For those who had watched this anime, no need to explain. 
 I liked the High School of the Dead manga way better then the anime. Also the Love Hina anime was awful. 
 Lesstron : ha, I only read the manga. Is this anime so awful because they have twisted the plot? Because of the animation? Some of people don't like the first FMA serie. Oh.. Can I say that Saint Seiya Omega is an insult at rh serie?

Oh.. Can I say that Saint Seiya Omega is an insult at rh serie? Its mainly the plot. It begins the same as the manga, and then throws in a whole bunch of different episodes that were not in the manga. The part of the show that sticks with the manga only goes maybe, half way through the mangas story. 
 Trinity Blood could have been better as an anime if it were a bit closer to the manga, but to be fair, the manga is still ongoing, so the made up ending was unavoidable. Still, everything else was just a bit bad. Same for Samurai Deeper Kyo. WHile I would not call it a favorite, the anime was done rather poorly compared to the manga, especially that ending.

 Psyren because I really liked the manga and the anime in nonexistent. Basically every series that has a truckload of fillers. I kinda like the SAO manga better then the anime, but they're both great. Some have a few aspects the other doesn't. Meh, not much though. And if you'd let me mention light novels, the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya has a better book then the manga and anime, I'd say.
