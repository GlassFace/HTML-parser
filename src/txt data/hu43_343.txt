 [READ OP] What are you currently Listening to? - Page 2
 Well, with the close of the previous thread, I thought it best to create a new one. This is a place to merely share what you're currently listening to, and maybe even share what you like in particular or dislike. Of course, there isn't really much discussion to be had here, but that ain't really the point now is it! it's just music really. "Who Says" - Christina Grimmie A pretty much an up and coming, hope she does well in the future. Shes great. Edit by Kouketsu: Ground rules for this thread: 1. Please post a link or a video to the song, preferably with name, title, album, and your thoughts/comments about it. Example of bad comments: "its okay" Example of better comments: "I'm really digging this - it's got a killer riff about 2 minutes in and the solo is top-notch. Check it out." Sample format to use: Artist: Song: Album: Rating: Thoughts: Link/Video: 2. Please, for the love of god, put videos in [spoiler] tags. I will seriously infract people who do not do this. This is because once the page gets filled up with 30 Youtube videos trying to load all at once, it becomes hell for people with average-speed internet. This isn't Myspace. 3. Maximum 1 track post per day, for now at least. Thoughtful discussions (Read: NOT chat threads) around tracks posted are allowed.
