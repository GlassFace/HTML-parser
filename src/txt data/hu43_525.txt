[Event] Help A4 Throw the Biggest Birthday Party Ever!
 Been doing some work in the background but thought I should chime in. I started A4 when I was 18 and am now 28. What really makes me feel old is SweetSakura who joined when she was 13 and is now 23. Time really flies. Happy Birthday to A4 and it's great to see some of the old faces again. 
Owner and Admin of A4, Feel free to message me but PLEASE make sure your question isnt already answered in the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) Forum located HERE.
