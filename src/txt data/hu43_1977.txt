 Favorite Key Anime?
 As most people know, the animes made based off of Key Entertainment's visual novels made some of the most heartwrenching, and most relatable stories in the anime world. Most characters being true to life, and extremely easy to get attached to. Out of all the animes that have been released based off of their Visual Novels, which would be your favorite? I have to say that mine is Clannad, I had friends like all of the characters, and related exactly like Tomoya, so the show hit pretty hard! 
I hate this town. It's too filled with memories I'd rather forget. I go to school everyday, hang out with my friends, and then I go home. There's no place I'd rather not go ever again. I wonder if anything will ever change. Will that day ever come? -Tomoya Okazaki
 Definitely clannad. i don't care what anyone says clannad is one of the most powerful animes of all time

 Clannad without a doubt. I have only just started watching kanon, but I highly doubt it or any other anime will ever come close. It is top notch in every way imaginable. Absolutely amazing and lovable characters, gorgeous animation and character design(and great sunset settings, my favorite), tremendous emotion that is done perfectly, both the happy and sad scenes, awesome plot and background, especially for a slice of life anime, perfect mix of comedy, sol, drama, and raw emotion that will make almost anyone cry, absolutely amazing OST that fits perfect with each scene, and those two breathtaking openings...my god. The opening for after story will without a doubt remain in my head for as long as I live. Clannad ad will be in my heart forever and will always be my favorite. It is a must watch for anyone who is into emotional anime and sol. 
 I think Air rivalled Clanned in terms of the heart wrenching moments. I don't know maybe. I definetely liked Air but I'm going with the flow here, so Clannad is my favourite Key anime. 
 Dubstep Chaos Theory - ShockOne l Siren - Kat Krazy ft Elkka l Faith - BlasterJaxx 
 Air was good but it got confusing during the last few episodes

 Even though I liked clannad alot, I would have to say Angel Beats, the characters were just so witty in that anime lol,and had a good story too

 The supernatural stuff i could deal with. It was mostly just the whole bird thing and the fact that they never really explained anything xept the stuff with mizuzu. Like ok i get it she's the heroine but come on the other girls stories never got resolved and half way through they basically vanished

 Clannad > Kanon 2006 > Air = Angel Beats! Although, I don't think Angel beats is a key visual novel. Can't rate little busters, but I'm guessing it wouldn't match up to Clannad and Kanon. Air and Angel beats both had nice premises, but stories that spiraled out of control. I could forgive all that in Air though if that ending wasn't so obvious because I thought it had some really beautiful themes behind it that key seemed to reuse in other anime (like the "life" Yukito's doll had lead, girl who is a spirit, etc). Angel Beats was really weak after about the 3rd episode with Iwasawa's backstory. All that stuff with the programmer and what not was such non-sense. Thinking about it though, I would watch if they made an OVA for Iwasawa's backstory. Loved that episode.

 Hmm going off of anime I think Clannad would have to be the best since they really tied the story together and I can't say anything about the anime of Little Busters since I haven't seen refrain yet. Angel beats could have been better if we went into more back stories of other characters. However actual game wise I would have to say Little Busters takes the cake. 
 I guess I am not with the majority personally though I liked Angel Beats the best, however Little Busters! Refrain may take it's place as I am really enjoying it at the moment. But I have to agree Clannad is one of if not the most heartwrenching anime out there.

 While I've only watched three of four eps of Angel Beats I'd still have to say it doesn't compare to Clannad. Haven't finished After Story yet, just watching ep 20 now, but it seems like the first season had a lot more happier moments. Most of the eps in After Story are hard to keep a dry eye from beginning to end. 

 Angel beats is great but clannad is way better and if i may clannad is everything angel beats should have been

I did not like Air for the same reasons you listed but I was a little more caught by Angel Beats than Air. For me: Clannad>Kannon>Angel Beats>Air. Angel Beats's last episode was difficult to watch (not because it was bad).

 Clannad is definatly my favourite out of those four anime. You often see people comparing Angel beats to clannad, saying that It's better. But for me, Angel beats wasn't nearly as sad as Clannad was. Not only that, but clannad you could relate too. It was a lot more realistic, which gave it that heartfelt reaction. Angel beats was also good, but as I said above.. You can't exactly relate to what happens in it as much. I could go into more detail about them, but I'm bound to give away spoilers. So I will leave it at that <3 Clannad > Kanon 2006 > Angel Beats > Air

Angel Beats's last episode was difficult to watch (not because it was bad). For me, the ending of Angel beats was kind of a trick. It was a literal "I have your heart" instead of a metaphorical one (which I loved). But it opened more plot holes than it answered. Also, I think the speech on the sea wall did more to ruin Air than the rest of the series. That speech wasn't needed and basically told the viewer what was happening. Just have Sora fly away and let the viewer work to figure it out. Objectively, I have to think more people like Angel Beats than Air here not because the story in Air is weaker, but because they just can't tolerate sad endings. And it sort of makes even more sense when you realize the ending of the Clannad anime is the weakest of them all (because practically nothing is explained).

The ending of After story, or actual the first season? If you are talking about after story, its not something that needs to be explained really. If you have half a brain, you can work it out easily enough. Not everything needs to be explained fully. They give enough of a hint through the anime, as to how, and why it happens at the end. Not trying to be rude to you either. Also trying not to give spoilers out.

I have reason to believe that you watched Clannad subbed. While you think they just ended after story without explaining anything, they had actually been explaining it throughout the whole show, and if you are paying attention to subtitles you miss a few things that happened on-screen (the main thing that lead to the way it ended, having to do with a legend) i'd advise rewatching a bit of after story, and you'll find out what i mean, but you could also look it up.

 As great as Air and Clannad were... Kanon 2006 and Little Busters were much better suited to me. Saying that, I haven't watched Little Busters Refrain yet, but I am looking forward to it (After I finish Oreimo). The think I love about Little Busters is that it isn't mainly based around romance like in Clannad and Kanon. It also has some really funny parts which kinda kept it non-samey and tedious. The fight scenes always cracked me up As for Kanon, I think it was much more of a character build tha tI enjoyed in that. Each character had longer screentime so we got to know them on a better level than in Clannad or Air. That being said, all 4 are great. I would also like to say that I REALLY enjoyed One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e too 
 I'll admit air wasn't big on character development but thanks to clannads second season most of the main cast got pretty good development but i have yet to see kanon so i can't say which was better 
  Spoiler  Spoiler 
 I'm going to be the square peg in the round hole here and say that I liked Air the most, Kanon 2006 the second most, and Clannad/After Story the least. Incidentally, that's the order I watched those animes in. Can't speak for Little Busters, though. Clannad the game is phenomenal though! Despite the art, I really loved it; it really moved me. Maybe reading Clannad first is why I didn't like the anime so much. 
 I really recommend watching Little Busters. Although I've watched 3 episodes of Refrain and I am not sure I want to go on because I know that if I do, I am essentially commiting emotional suicide :P Which means its a great anime but not great for my feels 

 Kanon 2006 probably haha
