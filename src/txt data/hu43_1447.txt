 lol, I just don't like the look on that land boy. He seems more presumptous than Hii.

 *Q* The scenery and the sea people eyes are absolutely stunning. Was crying my eyes out from its brilliant visuals with Derek x) But I'm wondering where the anime is really heading too. And the farting fish on the knee scares me O A O 
 
 In anime club today we watched the training camp episode of K-On! and at the part where Mio touches the barnacle wall and Ritsu tells her she's going to grow barnacles out of her knees (which she continues to haunt her with through the rest of the episode), I immediately thought of Manaka and the fish growing out of her knee! So I got them to play Nagi no Asukuara as our last show of the night so they could see what I was talking about... xD

It probably would have been really fun.

Wasn't one for me either, but the University anime clubs here allows anyone to join... including working professionals like myself. I missed out on all that during my school years.

 I can tell already this is going to be a great story, and deep as well. But I have a feeling it'll be totally underrated ( LIKE FROM THE NEW WORLD aka Shin sekai no yori) The animation is absolutely stunning, although Manaka's personality gets on my nerves. AND AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT PAID ATTENTION TO WHAT KANAME SAID TO MANAKA? The other guy friend in the group? He was talking to Chisaki, and he said something along the lines of that if Manaka Disappeared, Kaname would be able to get closer to Hikari. And he was totally serious!. Like what kind of friend is that? 

 No you're not the only one who heard that! It's almost like a love triangle but it's not!

 I'm pretty sure he didn't mean it like that, and I'm convinced that he actually has feelings for Manaka from how that scene went. So when he said disappear I think he meant that if she was out of the picture Chisaki could have Hikaru and maybe he'll have somewhat of a chance with Manaka. 
 Yup, I agree with Takeshi^. Damn water beather can say something smart sometimes.

 Alright after watching the second episode I have realized some things.  Spoiler Manaka fell in love too fast with Kihira, she is willing to be cursed so that she doesn't have to lie to him anymore. Hikari obviously in love with Manaka doesn't want this to happen, but now that they found out what happens when you fall in love with surface people he feels he has to protect Manaka even more. Hikari is just a male Tsundere too which is why I don't really like him, he's a jerk. And I feel awful for Chisaki because she has feelings for Hikari but she knows she cannot express those feelings towards him. DAMN IT DRAMAS WHY MUST YOU MAKE AWFUL LOVE PROBLEMS!!! The Positive thing is that this is a 25 episode anime, so maybe they'll introduce some more characters and make the love triangle more crazy. 

 Now I know why the sea is salty... 'CAUSE HIKARI MAKES ALL THE GIRLS CRY!!!

 Tsugumu is just pissing me off as these episodes progress, and Manaka is acting all dumb over him when she has Hikari right in front of her, things better change lol.

We really do have a clash of mindset, sea dweller, 'cause I feel the exact opposite. Hikari jeeos pissing me off with his mean, jealous, possessive attitude and I feel that Manaka deserves somebody nice like Tsugumu. Us land dwellers and sea dwellers really do think different!
