[Action] Kill La Kill
 I personally love the animation style, it is what initially drew me to the anime itself. The first 5 or so episodes were really mediocre for me, it seemed like I had been watching the same episode over and over again. Girl goes to school, fights person, wins or they run away, repeat. It wasn't until episode 6 and 7 that it seemed to perk up a bit, although unfortunately it seems like it is going right back to its previous formula of girl fights someone wins, fights next person. Could use with a little less fan service for the suit though, the first time I saw it I was like, oh come on really? Although it has grown on me a little. I would much more prefer a bad ass style costume then one that is simply there to show as much skin as possible. There are certainly glimpses of awesomeness for sure, and I really hope it gets a little more juicy, but as far as the actual story it is surprisingly meh at least in the way that it is executed. If it doesn't get better I will likley drop this one.
