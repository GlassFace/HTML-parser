 Horror Anime Suggestions?
 Hey guys, recently I've run out of good anime to watch and I want to get your opinion on what I should add to my watch list. I guess I love the horror/mystery anime. Some of my favorites are Mirrai Nikki, Deadman Wonderland, Ghost Hunt, Another, Durarara. Any suggestions would be great!
