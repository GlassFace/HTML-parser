 Hi New Arlong
 I just joined to advertise my artwork. Also, I like One Piece I've watched every episode to date. I'm into Beyblades and a little bit into Little Battlers Experience. I've always been into Pokemon. You can call me Freedia or you can call me Sin, I'm 24 I like rock music, I have medium length hair and I live in the UK!
