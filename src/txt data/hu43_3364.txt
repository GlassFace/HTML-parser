 A4 Has a New Owner!
 Jesus Christ Knucks, I finally remember to do my yearly log in here again and check if Kyuu has burned the place down or if the Rancor has gotten loose and eaten all the Naruto-fans and instead I see you've sold the site? Good for you Hope you have fun on your new adventures. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go off and cause a rancor-related "accident".
