 After College Relationship Question
 Yes, i agree but for me i am stuck her in my parents house for another year or so till i can get a real job to support myself having a apartment and owning a car or at least a means of transportation, and enough to pay my bills. So right now i am kind of stuck in my area and its hard to find people in my area that have open minds about things, they are very conservative you could say on there way of thinking. I hope to just meet people online for now is my best option.
