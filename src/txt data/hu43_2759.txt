 Anime California 2014
 This convention started today Friday the 22nd in Garden Grove California. It's also their first year hosting this convention! Because of how new it is, there's not a lot of people so its totally a nice break from big cons like Anime Expo. It's half anime half gaming so there's a nice blend of that around here. Here's their website: http://animecalifornia.com/ I'll be there tomorrow to take pics and maybe record clips for another video like my Anime Expo one!
