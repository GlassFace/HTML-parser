[Anime] Can anime characters become role-models?
 Can anime characters influence you to such an extent that they become your role models? Their ideologies and personality makes you feel you want to implement them in real life? I was quite touched by the character Kiba from Wolf's Rain. His determination always got me going. Do you have anime characters that inspire you a lot? 
 Definitely. However, I never have role models... Sure, I'd like to be smart like Shikamaru and L and stuff... but they aren't role models. Sure, I'd like to be able to clone myself 20x and use a bankai and fly... but they aren't my role models :s

 It will depend on the person for sure. I don't hold any particular anime character as a "role-model" myself, but I have been inspired by anime. One in particular was "Welcome to the N.H.K.", because at the time of watching it, I was in a situation similar to the MC of that anime. Granted my case wasn't quite as severe, but I was job-less, on my own and getting more and more lethargic as the months passed. That anime hit a little bit too close to home when I watched it and I dare say it increased my resolve not to fall into a pit like that. 
 Yea definitely I always looked up to Detective Conan as a kid watching cartoons. 
weee
 I would say Luffy from One Piece has been one of my biggest role models in my life. I keep a one piece symbol on me pretty much 99% of the time. kind of obsessive but it reminds me to keep chasing my dreams.

 I wouldn't say that there rolemodels, at least not in particular but every anime has some bad ass characters in them and all of them inpsire us in ways that we wouldn't get from friends or family, especially when you're a bit down, there is always an anime to look at and it will just make your day and be happy again so anime and it's characters are more a source of inspiration and relaxation than a rolemodel in my opinion 
 ​​THE ONE AND ONLY SANTA CLAUS​
 Its possible for anime characters to become role models, I don't have any myself though. Also, I think some people would outgrow having animated characters as role models. 
 So many books, so little time.
 Most protagonist anime characters are role models. They are mostly good people who are very determined to achieve a goal. Though I may not see them as role models, I can see why some may. Especially younger kids. Other characters are losers who inspire me to not to be like them. 
 Yep. I believe anime characters can make for role models. Though fictional, hey lead lives that represent an ideal for others. I have a number of role models from anime. My top 2 are: Genkai (Yu Yu Hakusho) - When I was younger I wanted to be cynical, sarcastic, but successful at whatever it is I did. And I didn't want to feel burdened by my past endeavors/experiences. I think it worked. Ryoko (Tenchi) - I wanted to wild, free, and pretty much do whatever I damn well pleased. Kinda like she did. Minus all he boy obsession.

 Absolutely, I for one took a certain female character to heart at a very young age and she not only taught me a lot but, had some great quotes that I still follow until this day. I think I've said it here before but, in any case it was Sailor Moon. She taught me that true love is worth fighting for. That real friends will always be there when you need them. That everyone deserves a chance to show they're good. And above all that without the bad we would have the good, that life is precious. The American version of Sailor Moon even went a step more at the end of each episode for a while they would give you advice. I love when a character that kids look up to does things like that. (Even if the dub was awful.) So I'm sure that answers your question.

 Hell yeah they can be role models , but try and pick the good guys as your role models :P I myself have a role model - rock lee from naruto is my role model , mainly because of his determination in the start of the manga series and how he won't let anything stop him. I also do kind of use his goal setting thing a lot in real life, where u say to yourself if I don't do a certain thing something really important to me won't come true or happen. This is a great way for me to achieve my goals to so yes they certainly can be role models 
 As a child Goku was my role model, and i think it genuinely made me a better person back then. I still have characters i see as role models now (not all good) thou not as much as goku was. I do not see a problem with it since the existence of the character isn't what you admire, the ideal are. 
Sand Cats are Bloody Adorable. 
 I never had any actual anime role models, but if JRPG characters count then yes. FF8's Squall in particular served as a bit of a role model for me when I was younger. Nowadays I'd say no though, because I prefer to pave my own path instead of trying to duplicate someone else's. I still think it's perfectly okay if people have anime characters as role models though. ^^ 
 Yeah I have a few anime characters that I admire. 

 Am I the only one that think the correct answer is no? An anime character is a creation of an artist and writer where as a role model is someone you aspire to become. Want a better example? Leonardo da Vinci is an artist and brilliant mind that people can look at and read up about. They can aspire to follow in his footsteps and take up art, mathematics, music or engineering. His painting the Mona Lisa is an art piece that he created and therefore doesn't have a true history or sense of direction. To me, stating that an anime character is a role model is pointless as they are an art piece created for the purpose of entertainment and do not undergo real life challenges.

Try reading the poem 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' and if you have read it try musing on it. If you are smart you will get my point. 
 I for one think that the right type of character can influence an individual to be a better person. For example, I take a cue from characters who are greatly protective of family/friends such as : Okazaki Tomoya (Clannad), Kirigaya Kazuto (better known as Kirito from Sword Art Online), Kurosaki Ichigo (Bleach), and Eren Yeager (Attack on Titan). The way these characters are written can make an impression on someone looking to stand for what they believe in. You become attached to anime characters in a deeper way than you would a character in American film or television because even in the most fantasical setting, they are believable characters. Give credit to the script writers and the voice actors/actresses who breath life into these moving drawings that have fascinated us for decades and have given us the opportunity to be influenced by them. Even when I'm having a rough day, I recall the resolve some of my favorite characters have in the most dire of situations and use that as a reference to push through. It might sound dramatic or even a little extreme for some casual fans, but the point of the thread was to determine whether or not anime characters can actually be role-models even though they are animated fictional elements of someone's creative mind. In the big scope, we are saying that the writer is our role-model because these characters are his/her outlets for thier ideals and beliefs as human beings. So, yes, my role-model can be an anime character and I will not recant! 
 There is many life lessons in legends in myths as well, and I think characters that are not real are no less viable than a real person. Even in non anime this can be true, such as MLP FiM the first season focused on life lessons, which were demonstrated by it's colorful cast. In games it's recently been demonstrated in detail how a character can serve as a role model. In Bioshock Infinite "Don't be a Dimwit" with Dimwit and Duke. Yes, the primary audience there is for kids in the game, but the characters were created specifically as role models for their future generations (al beit brainwash types). Some role models CAN be dangerous if realism is completely left out of the equation. First one I thought of was Beavis and Butthead. Even the beginning of the show says this: (Funny how it specifically uses the word role model.) Beavis and Butt-Head are not role models. They're not even human. They're cartoons. Some of the things they do could cause a person to get hurt, expelled, arrested, possibly deported. To put it another way: Don't try this at home. Point proven that teenagers originally saw B&B as role models, and hurt themselves by emulating them. Eventually I think as people grow older they will probably look for living role models (or even become their own role model) and look less towards characters for inspiration. A 60 year old man at my job inspires me because of his unwillingness to give up his job, despite all of the pain he experiences. A 62 year old woman lost both of her knees and can barely walk, yet she greets me with a smile everyday. THESE people inspire me, they are my role models. They prove that happiness can be found even in the darkest times. I have always "looked up to" my elders because of their willingness to go on and still enjoy life. They are usually my favorite characters in shows as well, Tenzin in Legend of Korra (pseudo anime) immediately comes to mind. ^^ So the last point, a role model should be "real person"? Well, maybe, but a character is a spawned alternate personality of it's creator's mind. It exists in at least thought form, and is portrayed through a story and animation. Does that make them less inspiring? Should a person denounce an inspiring character that makes them happy and shows them things they may not have originally seen? I think not. Whatever helps a person mentally survive, feel happy, grow, or keep fighting is a worthy candidate to emulate in my opinion.
