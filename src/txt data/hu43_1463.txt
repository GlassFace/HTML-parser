[Fantasy] Tokyo Ravens
 Also coming this fall. This looks cool. Gotta love Onmyoji. Synopsis: An Onmyodo School Fantasy of a Failing Private Onmyo Academy Student!! Tsuchimikado Harutora was born into a prestigious Onmyoji family, but he can't see "spirit energy". Therefore, he's been enjoying a peaceful daily life with his friends at an Onmyo branch school. One day, his childhood friend Tsuchimikado Natsume, heir to the head family, suddenly appears. Will this cause his destiny spring into motion!?

 I almost forgot about this one, but it's now aired! I really like stuff about spirits and onmyoji, so I'm excited to watch it!

 Saw the first episode about an hour ago, and I have to say that I really like it so far, and I'm interested in seeing how it progresses.  Spoiler That kiss at the end was a huge shocker though, definitely didn't see that coming lol I feel so bad for Hokuto. She had to watch the guys she likes get kissed by another woman. 
 Damn, everything finally came together in Episode 3! So good... I'm really looking forward to the rest of this series! <3

 Episode 3? I have been neglecting this show it seems, I was thinking the second one was still coming up Really liked the first so I'm looking forward to catching up 
 You've got a great ride ahead of you in the next two episodes!

 You were right, woke up this morning and decided to watch episode 2 Why would I decide to start my day like this ;_;  Spoiler Whole episode was so sad, but especially everything that happens once that girl dies saving him and confesses she loved him ;_;

 Episode 3 ends happy though. :3

 It really did, thought it was a very sweet/touching ending  Spoiler Even if it was only implied it was so heavily implied that I'm pretty sure you'd have to be oblivious to not see it, her being hakuto all that time to be close to him was pretty touching, looking forward to the episodes to come so I can see how they go about this weird falling in love through a familar situation. Especially since the main charcater does indeed seem to be oblivious. Have the strong feeling I'm gonna be watching this for the romance instead of the action (Though I didn't really like the part of the fight were they were focusing on the dragon, felt like I was watching final fantasy for some reason)

So he could be with you-know-who, lol! And we even know where she got her name from, lol!

And we even know where she got her name from, lol!  Spoiler I think she could have done better than naming her after a big yellow dragon to be honest And yea, I was thinking it was really strange during that first episode that she was really into him going to tokyo and stuff when it would mean leaving her behind. Was probably my biggest question about what was going on in the first episode. His friend was kinda boring untill the end of the third episode too, I thought his and her's dialog was pretty funny.

I think he's cool though, and it was good to see him speak out more in the last episode!

 Finished the newest episode and I really think it's new favorite character for this show time (Sorry Natsume ;_; )  Spoiler

  Spoiler lol, so Kyouko mistook Natsume for Harutora, and she's upset that about the other party forgetting the promise. Her memory ain't so good either. Granted, who can blame her... after meeting only once and thinking that Natsume is the male head of the family. It's not her fault, but kind of ironic nonetheless. xD PS, Touji is the coolest schemer of the bunch. xD "Does it bother you?" lol.

 XD loved how he just suddenly appeared to say that the first two times too Loving his character more and more every episode  Spoiler And I think it's hilarious that she thinks she's a guy and has a crush on "him' Though it sucks she now thinks he likes the other girl, I want her to admit that she was the one controlling the familar already ;_; 
Trying my best to get to know people
  Spoiler Half-oni.... o_O

 We are finally coming out of some of the stuff. 

 Now where did I put that book...? So things are really getting deep now, huh? Now we know the connection between Yakou, Onmyo Prep, and The Twin Horn Syndicate.... :o If only we had heard that last piece of information she was about to give away... I was actually thinking the same thing when (s)he was talking... why is he being so loose-lipped? xP
