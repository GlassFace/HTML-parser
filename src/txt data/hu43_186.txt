 Which Videogame Universe Would you Like To Live In?
 Well, right now i'm pretty enthralled by the universe of Red Dead Redemption, but I'm pretty sure if I lived in it I'd be shot dead by morning. XD So, more realistically, I'd have to say Ace Attorney cause it isn't dangerous and I need a nice suit. 
 I'm back!! Miss me? That "FLCL Club Guy". League of FLCL Whores - Enlist Today
