 Paper or Digital?
 I prefer having the physical copy, myself. However, I don't mind digital. I have a few books downloaded, but mostly because I wanted to read them the second they came out lol. And with my Mortal Instruments series, I have both digital and physical. Same with The Infernal Devices. xD I just prefer holding the book in my hands for some reason.
