[Personal Life Discussions] What do you do right after you finish your exams ?
 So I finished my last term exam for this term, and I am so relieve now. Like I have so much I want to do going into christmas. So the first thing I do after exams is always either start on playing more games or just start watching a bunch more anime to celebrate. Like how do you guys celebrate the end of exams ?

 I never stress out over exams, so there are no big changes other than I get to laze around more.

 After exams and school was done, I increased my hours at work. Still, that hasn't stopped me from doing a little partying with friends (alcohol was definitely included). 
 After exams are over I usually have fun with my friends, laze about and write short stories or make AMV.

 Well, I can relax more, watch some anime and have fun with my friends. 

 I usually have my exams late at night, so after I take them I just go to sleep 

 Lol, on the list of threads, the title for me cuts off at "finish," and I thought this thread was meaning something else. Hahahaha, got a good laugh out of that once I actually opened up the thread. So, after my exams, I'll usually just head straight to a friend's place and participate in a debauchery-filled evening. :v

 Smash out on video games by staying up til 4AM with friends and doing hardcore grinding in my all-time MMORPG (Dragon Nest). 
 
 after my exams finished I normally just went home got a big thing of iced tea and relaxed maybe watched a movie or two or anime

 I usually go out with friends and get drunk. That has become something we do on the regular now though so we might need to find something to do once we finish exams this semester.

 I usually just go and watch anime or just relax by reading homestuck. 

 Get Stoned, get drunk, start dropping, play video games. Binge everything including crap on the toilet. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 After my finals next week I'll be on winter break from Dec 8 to Jan 13, which I'm super excited about! I plan on spending my leisure time making cash, hanging out with friends when I can, reorganizing for my next courses and going to Magfest on the final break week I have; to party and see friends nearby in DC. Super psyched about that.

 Usually I'm all out of things to do because I've done them all during my exam week when I'm supposed to be studying hahaha. 

 I go home just like after any other class, because exams are not something I stress over before taking them. I generally don't even study -- benefits of being a sponge. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 I start to play more games and work more. Tis the season to make money
