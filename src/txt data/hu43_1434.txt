[General Discussion] What are/were you like in high school?
 Simple little thread as the title suggests, so what kind of student are/were you like in high school? 
 
 Just a simple ordinary kid. I have shaggy mop-top hair and I'm in the rock band club (rhythm guitarist and back-up vocals). I don't study much and my grades are just average. I go home early, and play MMORPGs with my friends. I didn't run for school president, my prom date was one of the school's smartest students. She's pretty, but not too pretty. I'm her senior and we met in a group activity and I guess that's the reason why we both decided to go together. Cutting-classes?? YES. Sometimes, I go to the convenience store alone during class period. I didn't enjoy high school that much. I still prefer my present college years

 I was the nerd. I hated school.

 Well i never followed the rules, and if a teacher told me to do something, i would actively do the opposite. I never did a single piece of homework but i would still tell other students the answers if i knew them (which i always did for maths and science), i got in fights a lot, i often hacked the school network for fun but one time a usb had a virus on it, and because i broke the security system, the schools computers got bugged and were down for a while. I never revised and the only tests i went to were maths and science but i usually got 97/98% scores, but this was careless mistakes. When i actually focused i got 100% so i got offered advance science classes that the top 5% in england get but the was a meeting in oxford or somewhere like that i never went to so i did not get the extra classes. I went to most lessons but i would go home if i could not be bothered to argue with a teacher about why i should not be in detention at lunchtime. And my writing was (and still is) illegible so i rarely wrote things down... It was a fun few years, for me at least. Nicole what were you like, you did not say!

 Damn, Akio! You were one of those students. (After typing out this post I realise I'm no better.) I'm still in high school so it took a bit of time to think how I'm acting. I'm going into Year 10 (Grade 9, I think.) and so far I've had a bad attitude towards my education.. At form I sit in the corner and wait for it to be over. I do homework late the night before it has to be in, I only do well in the classes I want to do well in (Try in Science and given up on RE and ICT). I start fights and get pissed off easily. However, I always get into the highest sets of students and my targets are high as well. :I Also, I may well be the only student in the entire school who openly likes anime.

 I was the hardworking JROTC-nazi as some would call it. Had a military 'high n' tight', carried myself professionally, and worked hard. Driven to excel I got nearly straight A's in all my classes (honors and AP), did a great deal of community service, partook in numerous extra-curricular activities (I tutored Math, did mock-government, played baseball, did many JROTC related activities-such as Drill Team, Rifle Team, etc, Spanish club, and the occasional leadership group). I got up at 4:45 every morning and got back home at around 5:30-6:00; I was always busy but it was fun. Still had time to play Halo 2 and teach myself how to play piano. Those were some good times. Man! Were they good times! I'm truly grateful for my experiences in high school and for the MCJROTC program.

 I was a ticking time bomb. I never knew when I'd go off and when I did hallways, bathrooms, and students got trashed. I've had counseling since then.

 When you watch an anime and you see a class full of students, I am that one student over there at the side near off screen which the anime never focuses on because I am not important. I was one of those dime a dozen students, just there to fill space. I did my homework, listened, and did normal high school stuff. When I was normally shy around everyone, except my friends. ONly when I was with my friends was I active and rather silly. Sometimes too silly. But it was fine, because my friends were silly too.

 Going to high school in 2 days for the first time, probably the same as middle school; that cynical **** who hates everything and everyone including the 3 friends, whom are the only people they hang out with.

You were in high school for 2 weeks? --- I hated high school, don't really have interesting memories from that time. However I will say that I'm glad that I've grown up A lot since I was in high school 3 years ago. Never really had A specific "group", but I will say I was everything from that completely banished loner to that horrid troublemaker, who literally hung out with the *******s of the school, lol.

Here you go, Akio: Here in Australia, you start high school when you are 12 or 13 years old (and it finishes when you're 17 or 18 years old). I have only been in high school for just about 3 years and have one year of being a 'junior' left. There are many phases which I have unfortunately been through and here is just a quick outline. Generally, I am the typical Asian student who focuses on her studies, avoids detention, complete my assignments (and on time) and tries to excel, but I'm also pretty cold-hearted and like to pull strings in the background, so that people do not get in my way. Ever. In 2011, I started my first year, I was a loner, ready to turn to a new page in my chapter. I was socially awkward and didn't like a majority of my grade. I was also someone looking for trouble - not with teachers, but with the boys /facetable. That didn't end too well. Otherwise, I was your typical stereotype of an Asian and basically fell asleep in every class and ra ped everyone in exams. In 2012, I had changed into the better class of my high school and had made many trustworthy and amazing friends, those which were true and weren't temporary or fake. During my second year of high school, I wasn't as naive or immature as I was in year 7 and actually started working a little harder and unexpectedly still ranked the same as I did, the previous year. I was also that one girl who constantly fell in love (secretly) between two of my guy friends. Sooo yeah. This year, I'm just a pretty bland and boring student of 2013's Year 9 students...Still studying (starting to struggle though) and I'm practically in a class where I am the foreigner - literally.

 Really quiet. I was kind of a loner. I had a few friends and acquaintances, but for the most part I spent a lot of time alone. I didn't like my high school. After school I played basketball, that was my release. High School was like a 4 year prison sentence, that's how I looked at it. Not until my senior year did I get more involved with school activities and even took honor classes. Prior to that I really didn't care.

 An overachiever lol and I still am now that I am in college, I'm the type that knows what the teacher is expecting and I go above and beyond that and get the crazy 106% and I do extra credit etc, it's not because I mean to it's because I'm a perfectionist so it's like a disorder lol and anything less then the best I can achieve makes me sick to the stomach lmao so yeah I strive to be the best I can be.

 First two years I played sports. I studied alot, but then I got sick of highschool drama bullshit so my junior/senior year I just hauled ass and went home. 
 I didn't care much about anything but hanging out with the friends I had around my neighborhood. I slacked hard in high school, sitting in the back of every class falling asleep whenever i could. I was a mystery to most cuz i was a really closed off person, but the people in school who got to know me are some of the best friends I've had.
