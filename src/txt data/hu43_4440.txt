 SAO Controversy, why?
 I've noticed that lots of people consider an anime (or books, film etc...) a masterpiece or a sleaze. There are no half-size only taking it to the extreme. Another facts is that the story began as a shonen and people aspected to see an action anime, instead SAO is a mix between action and feelings.
