[Comedy] Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun
 English Title: Monthly Girl Nozaki-kun (because Nozaki-kun writes for a Monthly Shoujo publication) Plot: High school student Chiyo Sakura has a crush on schoolmate Umetarou Nozaki, but when she confesses her love to him, he mistakes her for a fan and gives her an autograph. When she says that she always wants to be with him, he invites her to his house, but has her help on some drawings. Chiyo discovers that Nozaki is actually a renowned shoujo manga artist named Sakiko Yumeno, but agrees to be his assistant. As they work on his manga Let's Love~ (恋しよっ), they encounter other schoolmates who assist them or serve as inspirations for characters in the stories. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (月刊少女野崎くん) is an ongoing Japanese four-panel web romantic comedy manga written and illustrated by Izumi Tsubaki. Its chapters are serialized in Gangan Online, and published in tankoubon volumes by Square Enix. An anime television series adaptation by Dogakobo is scheduled to air from July 2014.

 Read a few chapters a month or two ago and never got into it. I bet the anime will be rewarding though, and serve this manga well. It's mad popular, and maybe my opinion of it will change. 
 It's airing now!

 Well, I like the art work, the man reminds me of usagi drop main.

 Does this turn into a harem or is he just clueless that she loves him? I've stlii got so many shows I'm going through so I don't know if I'd get to it. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk I think...reverse harem? No, actually this doesn't turn into a harem. Check out the manga. Never really did pay much attention to the manga aside from the few odd chapters here and there. Aw, Chiyo's got a great voice-actor. Aha, gotta love those looks the people are giving them as they casually bike by. Wow, the page voice-overs are pretty good also, totally representative of Shoujo manga imo. THIS SUM GUD ASS CASTING FOR SEIYU VOICES MANG. Preview looks good,bring on the tomboy. 
 Dang it shmuser name! Now I've got another one I need to watch... . But the more that like it the better Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 This show is so funny and charming! I suggest not watching this anime in a public place with headphones on, or people will be wondering about your random bursts of laughter.

 Wanna go for a ride?

 Yes episode two was awesome. Really great anime. I was speechless when Seo was singing...I literally got goosebumps. I like her a lot. Pretty funny so far, wondering whats gonna happen with the relationship though. 

 lol "The Hero is so annoying." got a good chuckle out of me. OMG I love how spot=on the Shoujo manga page voice-acting is for the 2D characters, its great! Seo seems G, she's cute too. Pegasus statue?! What a public school. Love how Seo comes out as a nice girl, but then the comedy kicks in and its revealed that shes a ***** at times. Love her. Oh man! This is great to see animated, holy **** it's good stuff. You git it wrong again Nozaki, I think you're a bit more oblivious than Seo. 
 Seo was unintentionally hilarious. Loving this show so far.

 Judging from the first episode, this seems to be Sakura's fondest memory of Noazki-kun... The Lorelei of the Glee Club. xD I love how Sakura's view of her fried Seo is so much more positive than reality, like how Nozaki views his friend Mikorin. xD Irritated people... (Nice dodge, Sakura!) Blushing Sakura. <3

 I finally got to this one! Just finished episode 3. Its really cute. The animation style is so fanciful I guess is how I'll describe it. Its really funny. I like the interplay between the characters. And when they start imagining stuff its really funny. I'll definitely stick with this. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 I like the raw comedy here, there's no bullshit-- if that makes sense. Seo/Long John is just as badass as ever. Kashima's got...quite the character traits, and a pretty good foil too, Hori's a cool cat. Be proud Kashima, Pinata Pride-- there is honor in being the favored one in a beating. Nozaki's other sides are amusing, and does this ***** even ball? He's tall and built, but 2K is LYFE. The voice acting is so superb for this anime, and the character animations are simple but very effective. Kashima reminds me of a certain Prince Livi. Hori-senpai really is a swell guy. The preview for next episode looks amazing, plenty of lulz inbound. 
 Actually at first it seemed to me that nozaki looked to be too old looking. But I guess its just because he's so tall that he doesn't seem to be a typical school anime character. I get what you mean shmuser name about the comedy. It doesn't seem to be forced or halfhearted. And the reactions are always amuzing. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 Episode three had me rolling! CHIYO Can you believe he said Nozaki-kun is cuter then me? I agree with Hiro XD lol 

 That dating sim...they were practically shipping the whole episode! Nozaki gets me every episode. 

 haha, Tomoda is a great guy. He deserves a BL award. hue also, don't let kashima into any kind of events that involves girls!

 Already a good start with that love sim. Sakura's guage has filled, can now use her special move. Holy shet, Tomoda is best wingman, give him a medal. T-T Yus, love the voice-acting for the manga bits! That Pegasus statue is also as swag-tastic as always. lol Sakura, I love how you embraced that thuggish role. Aw, those poor dudes at the mixer...they didn't even seem that bad, looks wise and all :I Alright, next ep preview seems to show a small slew of new characters! I think I spotted a love rival there. 
 All during episode 4 all I could think of the first ten minutes was oreimo! I definitely like this show a lot.... You know I think I edited that first sentence too much! Its either a run on sentence or just plain doesn't make sense or maybe I'm just being too hard on myself...... Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 She's got them fujoshi eyes... But damn, that VN/mixer episode was SO funny! I laughed heartily all the way through it!
