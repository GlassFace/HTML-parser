[Horror] Tokyo Ghoul - Page 2
 Tokyo Ghoul (kanji:東京喰種, katakana:トーキョーグール) is a manga series by Sui Ishida, serialized in Shueisha's seinen manga magazine Weekly Young Jump since September 2011. The story follows Ken Kaneki, a young man who receives organ donations from a "Ghoul" after he is nearly killed. Ghouls are creatures that look human but need to eat human flesh to survive. Kaneki soon realizes he is now half-human and half-ghoul. It has been collected in eleven tankōbon volumes as of April 2014. An anime television series adaptation by Pierrot is scheduled to air from July 2014. Can't wait to see this one! It'll be here next month! >_< *squee*
