"Captain Earth"? really, thats the best name they could come up with. It sounds like a 1990's era C+ anime title and the sypnosis did not do it enough justice That is what I thought of before I watched the first episode. Also even though BONES made this one would think that they could come up with a mecha concept that didnt look like the Nirvash type zero (I mean theres lots of colors and designs out there in our big blue world c'mon!) Stuff like that turns me off anime titles; but I decided to give it a try Just my opinion after watching sooooo many titles (good and bad) for way too many years. P.S. I'm high on life my friend 
 Loving this show so far, it's what I had hoped from Star Driver. The main characters interactions are great too, nice having a severe lack of teenage angst and misplaced anger making everything awkward and bad for the first half of the series! 

 Originally Posted by 早乙女乱麻 Are you high? This anime, so far, is really awesome. The animation is pretty smooth and I don't hate any of the characters, yet. So the obviously possessive and generic government d-bag hounding over the hot experimental chick with olive skin is a likable character to you, bro? I mean that as a joke! No punches being thrown here. The latest episode was wicked with Madam Belly Button's espionage skills and Teppei meeting that particular badass (with a hefty link to the boy) for the first time. As far as the design of the mechs so, I don't like them but I also don't dislike them. The technology the show introduces is really cool, I'm excited to see what the future brings to our Earth regarding the atmosphere and outer space. Captain Boomerang (as I call the main character, ignoring DC's copyrights) is a weak protagonist to me as of the moment. I do enjoy his shipping with the tan girl and Teppei's shipping with the hacker. Blast me, I forgot their damn Japanese names. The latest ep was really wicked, I like how my shippings are getting fleshed out and there's some mystery as well as closure mixing to make a the steady plot.

 Always loved how the anime does not give a **** about how the Earth engine's arm thrusters are replaced with giant mecha hands, how Pitz's species of animal is never explained, and how the main plot's backstory is revealed every other episode with a snippet or two of information. This is a good show, just a bit...off at times. Then again you have BELLY BUTTON FORTE so I'll stop talking and enjoy that trim waistline and tight abdomen. Teppei looks awesome in his K***g**g form. The space combat was cool, too. Ohhh the skinsuits looks sexy on those chicks, man! Loved the medallion callback. What the team name represents is great too: The group serves Daichi, the seasonal inception of the group, and it's a reff to William ****ing Shakespeare! The preview clips looked hawt and epic. Please dribble more ecchii, just don't go overboard. After the latest ep: I've said before that I really like the technology in this anime, and this episode was chock full of juicy and badass tech once again. I really like how the good guys were not able to win this time, then again there is always is something like a would-be ally becoming corrupted, it adds drama and conflict to the plot. Really nice backstory to Zin also. Lucky Cap'n with his hawt olive-skinned vixen and uber sexy tech expert.

 Love the small scale mech combat. I wonder how the Ordinary's thrusters work seeing how there isn't any cryogenic or coolant work to not melt whatever the flames are pushing off against? Love the tiny backstory they give the newly introduced designer children before masking them the bad guys. Akari is awesome! All hail the Magical Girl! 
 I guess Ned is asleep at the wheel, no pics???? Actually I'm glad there aren't any. That's all I need, another series that I wont' be getting to for god knows how long....... But this sounds promising to me: Originally Posted by shmuser name Akari is awesome! All hail the Magical Girl! That caught my attention

 Damn, Lin's hawt. Also, I feel that the original two Planetary Gears that were were introduced to behave like a Jesse and James duo, lol! Woah, Lin in her Machine Goodfellow form is sexy as well! Remarkable mech battle in space, Teppei's the man. JESUS CHRIST who the **** was that at the end...with a pink fem-Pitz?! 
 This show really isn't very well written, but the robot sequences and transformation scenes are just absolute mecha porn. So good.

I tell you I always learn something new on this website I've started a bunch of a new series but I think I want to finally start this one as well. I was meaning to start kill la kill and space dandy last night but didn't get to those yet. At this rate I'll be watching 10 or 15 different series at once (well one one day then one another but still)

 ~ A good chunk of Shakespearean allusions, then again doesn't anything? Hawt pool chicks, Daichi can get a sweet paizuri. Setsuna's past and the dynamic duo's past was cool to see. lol The Captain and his comrade going splinter cell in the forest. Oh ****, the scientists! The ****ing scientist scenes! Love the dramatic spike in events. Bloom, flower, bloom. woah, the preview looked sick as hell ~ Fistacuffa, hell yeah. Aw, what nice kisses. Baku seems like a badass, but who the **** else is piloting the Machine Goodfellow in the preview? Also, IMMORTAL GANGSTERS?! Man, I fear for the safety of the team when they just dally into illegal or dangerous social areas...which they do a lot. ~ Woah, this was a really good episode! Baku is a boss, the most righteous of the Designer Children imo. I feel so bad for him...man, snuffed out romances as just harsh. Baku was strength, or I guess "tank" in the group. Previously we had Flight, Ranged/Artillery, Speed/Underwater. The preview for next episode smells like BEACH EPISODE. The tears are flowing, but its so damn kawaii! ~ Ok, first thing: That new OP has some awesome looking Designer Children and a sinister looking antagonist. There's a third Earth Engine, also?! The strange Designer Child girl and the Elementary School girl who had something to do with the Mc getting his Livlaster also make a return. Cool! Again with the Jesse and James duo, the pose is perfect. Aha, awesome reaction with the hotel room scene between Hana and the Cap. Love the ease in and ease out when the MC spies on sleeping Hana, a funny little animation. Jesus Hana, that was creepy. Dah-ham, the ecchii is real in this episode. Aw, Akari with her hair down is cute. Woah, the truth comes out-- but what the **** is the issue, Hana?! I...I s-see that's the, uh...the issue. Holy **** the preview for the next episode looks amazing. We got Setsuna returning, Amarok doing his *****-ass schemes, that ***** running Macbeth going all Pedo face, the two Livlasters being used as surface-to-air artillery, SO HYPE ~ Oh ****, Pitz! Damn Puck, chill the **** out. Aha! Love the triple kiss scenes! Awesome that Hana got a piece, but the **** is an "ecdysis"? Wow, the Planetary Gears are so fabulous, they look like models. Great episode, cool shift in events. ~ The relationship between Hakino and Kube is pretty amusing. I mentioned this before and I'll say it again, the Planetary Gears are all ****ing models because of their fashion sense. Woah, Hana better get her balls out of her purse and **** Aiatar up, that pink EVA suit doesn't just represent how kawaii she is. Pink is MANLY. Latest episode: Oh swimsuits...thank you for the eye candy. Damn Salty Dog is at it again, those scoundrels and landlubbers, blasted rapscallions...yaaargh...call me Ishmael. Hey Pitz is out and about, gg Pitz. Akari is an exceptional character imo...mad techno skills and a really good body that she's not afraid to show off, good personality too. Oh wow...Puck you two-timing little ****er...well, "little ****er" wouldn't really work for that big dick Corporate douchebag. That beautiful song is creating so much orgone energy! That sly gambler...so sly. Shaky cam on that rocket launch...I like the effect. The Cerberus Unmanned Impacters were underwhelming, no wonder they didn't get the job done. **** off Salty Dog. Damn ,Akari looked evil as **** for a moment! Badass resolution to this episode! The preview for the next ep shows Salty Dog being *****es...and a random friendly old man arrives.

 Gotta say the ego block escapes are getting super tiresome but I guess we're finally starting to approach the last of the robot battles between the Midsummer's Knights and the Planetary Gears. Should finally get to them all facing off against Puck soon. 

 Aw, such a motherly and loving scene. Creepy old dude appears. Daichi cut the ****, you're so a huge hero and we all know it. Alright team, get the Nerf Blaster Guns out and lock and load. Pitz gill the **** out! The tanks look like computer mice. Nice moves Daichi, did that count towards the Medallion game? Man, **** the Ark Faction. Those guys are punks...but they do bring good conflict. Also, poor Hitomi. lol 
 Duuude, ****ing bang her already man, wow that one phrase goes for so many people in this anime! Wow, that new Engine sure is a boss, not the cool kind, the annoying hour-long fight kind. JESUS CHRIST, that;s the blume?! Holy **** nobody told me it was a goddamn space-ship. Woah woah woah, what the hell is going on next episode?! Oh man, I'm pumped. 
 Yeah that mobile armor engine was amazing and I hope Puck ends up controlling something like that for the final battle. 

 Since the new unmanned engine looked like a head, bear with me, but what if Salty Dog made an even larger humanoid mecha engine based off the Earth Engine chassis, however it was gigantic and had separate engines as parts. Like Voltron...or Megazords. 
 Salty Dog seriously needs to invest in some new phones... or communicators. A cup and a laser string is kind of a dead giveaway to where you are. That latest mech was a tad freaky looking, it almost reminded me of King Kitan in TTGL.( A head and little legs) That or a Mobile Armor in Gundam; But thank god the good guys had the blue beam from the star ship to take on the red beam. (anyone wonder just how the hell she managed to get in the star ship? Just part of the plan folks, part of the plan) 
 
 Teppei's swimming reminded me of Free! and his philosophical crisis really did show his humanity despite him being an alien. OMG what a touching kiss scene! ...Yeah, you're TOTALLY going to do that you pedo ****. Man I really do hate it when a love interest literally gets kidnapped, snatched, or stolen away from their partner, and is Teppei going to be okay next episode?! 
 Oh ****, such a decision! The last scene reminded me of Mass Effect. I liked this development. 
 **** you Salty Dog, although Ando is actually hawt. **** you Kube/Puck. I really so hope some of the Planteary Gears like Moco or Bugbear switch sides or create discord among the Planetary Gears. D'awww, Hana and The Guv'nah are so close. lol "Let's go visit my dead father together, Uncle!" So enthusiastic. I worry for Hana's life, there are a **** ton of death flags always popping up for her. Whatevs Amarok, spout the usual bad-guy jargon before the action. Fat man YEEEEEEEELLLLLL. Ha, they're implementing the generic warp jump imagery. Really risky, a human using the Livlaster to try and stow-away on a ship about to warp jump, a ship which is targeted by a big ****ing cannon...the sci-fi drama is intense. What kind of an ending...?! Wtf man?! Was it all a dream? Daichi used to read Word Up! magazine? 
 Everything...is so familiar...I can't put my finger on it (I really can, it's just fun pretending not to know what;s up). All these characters just flashing into view or behaving differently, and the very atmospheric ambient soundtrack...it's getting a bit creepy actually. Oh boy, at least one Planetary Gear look-alike seems to know something, and it's my favorite one too! lol Daichi inadvertently hailed a cab! Oh ho ho, I like the symbolism. Oh man, what a nice episode of soul searching. 
 Bugbear's story was always a tragic one...he'll be a scary enemy to fight in his Mech form. Holy **** Hyperion is getting ****ing excavated! BUGBEAR, oh **** man. 10 mins in and now the OP plays, wow. Thank God for those badass Boosted Plasma Guns. The atmospheric music and the reveal of the Cocoon was fantastic to me, intense stuff man! It looks great. Ohh the old "Join us or die" gimmick. Wow, Siren can just rez? Wtf. The Livlaster at Hana's crotch made it look like she had a dick...awk. Puck you sinister mother****er. Holy crap Puck, what a life goal...what happened to Libon and my favorite girl, Lin?! This episode was so hype.
