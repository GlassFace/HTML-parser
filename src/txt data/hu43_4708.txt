 Requesting New Feature: Community Arcade
 Can we get a arcade we could hold annual tournaments plus several trophies displayed in the postbits would look very dashing. I think it would be fun and competitive. I know I would be the champion at snakes. Anyone else agree? EDIT___________ Also can we get international flags for the postbits?
