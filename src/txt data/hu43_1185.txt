[Action] Kill La Kill
 I dropped it around episode 21 or 22. I personally found it kinda boring, and all the ridiculous cliches you'd normally find in a shounen anime just came pouring out like it's meant to be entertaining or something. It didn't try hard enough to top Gurren Lagann, and it certainly wasn't as entertaining as Gurren Lagann, IMO. I know a lot of people ate this anime up pretty quickly, but it just wasn't for me. Maybe I'll give it another try in the future.
