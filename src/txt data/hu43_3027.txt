 Feminist games critic cancels talk after terror threat
 Eh. I don't considering the anti-GG thing "bullshit", I just began to realize just how embroiled 4chan is in all this and how that muddies up the waters for everyone involved. I still consider GamerGate to be a harassment engine posing as a movement for the betterment of ethics in journalism. Truthfully, I've just become keenly aware of where this is and is not going. When John wouldn't accept that GamerGate started because some guy was mad at his ex and made her sex life public stating that that was too stupid to be true -- even though that's exactly what got this whole thing going -- then I began to realize no one was getting anywhere on this topic. Rather than come here and argue with my friends over something I think we all innately agree about anyway (that harassment is bad and no one should do it) I decided to focus on other things. I'm not experiencing cognitive dissonance, I'm just exhausted by this whole thing.
