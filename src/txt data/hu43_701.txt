 Osu!
 Alright I wanted to start a thread about Osu! for a while now, so here it is! What is Osu! Osu! is a rhythm game where you use your mouse and keyboards to hit circles appearing all over your screen. You use your mouse to pilot and your keyboard to hit the notes, its a pretty cool and easy concept. Osu! has a lot of music genres created by the community, its pretty appealing for almost everyone mostly people who like anime. Why should I play Osu? You should play Osu! because its fun, but not only that its also free! If you want to improve your overall skill in gaming then this game is perfect for you, it increases your reflex speed tremendously. Not only does it increase your skill in games greatly, its also a good time killer. The best of all is that you can play/pause/stop anytime you want! there is no one stopping you at all. The game itself has a lot of maps on all kinds of difficulties, you can play at any tempo you want. From easy to normal to insane maps. How do I install Osu! Its simple~! you got to http://osu.ppy.sh/ sign up, download the client and download a song pack for starters. Installing songs into your Osu! client is pretty simple, you put the songs you have downloaded into songs folder of where you installed your Osu! client. Sounds pretty easy! The concept is simple, but don't underestimate the difficulty of this game. If your life bar disappears you failed. Show me a Osu! video For this one I'll be using one of my own replays to show you how HARD Osu! can be, I've only been playing the game for a few months on/off. I still don't understand how to play Osu! please elaborate. The game consists out of 4 parts, notes, sliders, stacked notes and spinners. Lets start with notes, you hit notes by moving your mouse over them and hitting the Z button at the right time. The Z button is the default hit button, you can also use the X which is also a tap, combining the Z and X button makes it a lot easier to do hard maps. Second one is sliders, they are probably either the most annoying thing in the game or your best friend. Sliders are just like notes except that when you hit them you got to hold the tap button which is in this case Z, and move with them until they are finished. The third one spinners! they are huge circles that appear on your screen and you got to rotate your mouse as fast as you can to complete them! Fourth one stacked notes, these things are quite annoying and you will see them a lot at higher levels, they are single notes stacked on each other which means you have to double tap or triple tap depending on how many there are. Z + X are your best friends. I want to add a certain song to my Osu! how can I find it! You can find certain Beatmaps by going to the official Osu! site http://osu.ppy.sh/and try the Beatmap search bar. Woah! some maps are terrible why? As I said almost all Osu! maps are made by the community, some can be quite terrible made by first timers, others can be very good. I recommend looking at the Beatmap with the most plays. Osu! doesn't have my favourite song as a beatmap Then create it yourself~! there are tons of Osu! tutorials on YouTube on how to create a good Beatmap! its really simple! Can I play this game with my friends? You certainly can! there is a online option in Osu! where you can both join a game and play a certain Beatmap. Don't have the Beatmap? no worries, you can download it while in the lobby by just clicking two buttons in the Osu! lobby. Online features in Osu! You can add people to your friendlist, on the site manually by visiting their profile or just searching them in the client. By doing this you can chat with them and spectate them. This game is too frustrating I keep failing. There are certain mods in Osu! one of them is No Fail, if you put this on you can play through a map even if you have a empty life bar, I recommend this for starters or even for everyone, I also play with No Fail on most of the time. Do try this game out! its more fun than you think it is!

 I love osu! its a nice simple no brainer game, although some of my friends don't understand the concept or why I find it fun. Tbh, I'm still not the brilliant despite playing it for a while on and off, but just adds to the fun of laughing at myself while I fail against others on insane beatmaps which is the majority of my osu life =L also, weirdly, its helped me improve my bass playing and my memory, its completely destroyed my right hand though, I can't play for too long or my hand and fingers go into pain and if I use the Z X keyboard method it sends my brain into a complete spaz XP Overall though I love it, and one day I shall beat you Takera! ONE DAY! 
 Haruhi: If there's really that many people in the world, then there had to be someone who wasn't ordinary. There had to be someone who was living an interesting life. There just had to be. Why wasn't I that person?

ONE DAY! Ahahaha, I have the same issue, I cant play with two fingers for the life of me, only at insane maps with a lot of streams it kind of works, I just like playing with one finger :| Yes! get better so we can play Tag 4 together and complete some impossible maps :O.

 I was thinking of creating a thread, here, about this, but since I'm a n00b, I got too nervous. I love love LOVE LOVE this game. I could play it for 6+ hours straight, easily. I play it in school all the time in my computer classes. I recorded myself playing just recently to show off how good I think I am (forgive the recording quality). No, I didn't get a 100%, because I don't like playing songs that are easy for me to get a perfect on. It's more fun to get an 80% on a hard beatmap than 100% on an easy, slow one. 
​
 Wah~! you are pretty good at Osu! we should play together! I also love your k-on skin lol! http://osu.ppy.sh/u/1799248 here is my profile

Sorry I play Osu but my mouse just had a nervous breakdown from watching that video. This is making me rethink ever attempting higher lvl songs 

 Playing together? Never tried it in my ~2 years of playing. I'll probably get nervous and have a heart attack, because I'm a big sissy who gets stage fright. -- Also, not sure if everyone in this thread is trolling or are simply friends making silly jokes with each other... [/n00b]

 Give us your IGN and we will play together =P

 Chiwwy But of course I must have the username "Chiwwy," or else I would freak out. But of course, American school times and such get in the way for a 16 year old, such as myself, so I can't play 24/7 like I would want to.

 Wah, passed another insane map. I really have no Idea how I did this one. I'm getting better at this game

 Nice, thats the kind of level maps I do, but without hidden lol >.< Also, hidden and flashlight give the same bonus, so why not use the easier one; flashlight? I'm like the only person who spins counter clockwise ... Assuming that like 95% of people are right handed... Would have thought more people do it counter.

Whats crazy is when people do Hidden+Flashlight on the super fast maps, and you don't see the hidden ones because of flashlight, which clearly means they have played the map so many times that they memorise it... Its insane >.>

 I discovered this game when one of my old call of duty clanmates introduced me to it a few weeks back. Its addicting, fun, and free. Cant beat it.

Ikr! its quite frustrating sometimes though as it provides a good challenge and you are like ACCEPTED but cant do it. Its a lot of fun and its amazing how much you can improve if you just play one hour everyday LOL.

 The feeling when you get 100 on the first circle, then continue not expecting to do well, then get 300 for the rest of the song... -.- Or 100 on the last one... I can't believe how many times thats actually happened. Btw do you guys have standards? Like if i'm <90% I retry.

Depends on the difficulty I'm doing, if its insane its 70% if its normal 100% if its hard I go for 95% Insane is pretty much free for all, just hit all the notes and you are good to go lol.
