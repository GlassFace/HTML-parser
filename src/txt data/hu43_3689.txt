 Top Russian diplomat says better relations with Georgia possible
 Russia is open to any initiatives to improve relations with Georgia, and sees humanitarian and brotherly ties with the Georgian people as very important, a deputy Russian foreign minister has said. “Russia is open for any constructive steps aimed at the normalization of relations with Georgia,” Vasily Nebenzya was quoted as saying by RIA Novosti news agency. “It is important for us not to lose the humanitarian, human and simply close relations with the people of this country. We can only welcome Georgian representatives at various cultural and youth events conducted within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).” The Russian diplomat added that he saw no serious reasons behind Georgia’s exit from the CIS, and said that the process could still be reversed. “Tbilisi made the decision to end its membership of our organization all by itself, without any pressure, at least from the side of other CIS members. Therefore, the initiative of possible return to the commonwealth must also come from Georgia itself,” Nebenzya said. read more: http://rt.com/politics/218923-russia...ter-relations/
