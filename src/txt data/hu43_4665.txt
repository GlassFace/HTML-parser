You can make your own version me and my partner did and it was a lot of fun. Just make sure the cards make sense. All you need is some flash cards cut them in half to make it more compact. Though you might not have time for all that. It took us on and off about a week. My personal favorite party game is flip cup and I like to do karaoke. Board games. Depends on what your friends are into.
