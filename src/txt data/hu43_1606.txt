[Adventure] Pokemon Origins
 Haha, I like how Green was all magnanimous at first "Oh you can pick first Red, I like a challenge" and then is all like "Screw my name, let's just pick the better type matchup!" like he does in the game. The writing for Green was just a lot more realistic than the smug jerk we got in the original with Gary Oak. It felt more like playful banter or honest criticism when he and Red went at it, which was nice.
