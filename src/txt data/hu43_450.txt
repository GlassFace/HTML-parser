[General Discussion] Need help identifying Kanji in picture
 Well, as it has been some years since the time I originally asked the question, I have actually thought to ask my sister on the matter. She's lived in Japan for a total of 3 years now, and knows many many languages. I just asked her and pretty promptly she replied, "owaranai yume mawari" and said it meant "never-ending dream rotation". So I'm not sure how much you are an authority on it being "mukai" versus "yume mawari", but it apparently means the same thing and is to mean the song's name which is "Endless Dream Loop" although I can't verify how official that exact wording is, and the song may be more intended to be like "Never-ending dream repeat" in English. I guess it's all interpretation once you hit that point of analysis. I'm really lucky to have my very own personal scholar on all things Japanese!
