 Shadow Fox's Mommy's Ham Stew!
 Ever make a baked ham? Have a bunch of it left over and its still like two days after? Got that bone and everything and a bunch of meat still on it? Try this recipe from my mommy! Its the best! Ham Barley Soup First you put all the bone, meat, and fat., everything that's left from the ham in a pot and cover it with cold water. bring to a boil and then turn it down to a simmer. cook it all for about one hour. then strain it all in a colander into another pan . that will be your stock. put the colander of bones, etc. into a big bowl to cool so you can pick out any meat that's there. you will add that to the pan along with diced up potatoes the last half hour of cooking time) Add.... one large can of whole peeled tomatoes (slice them up a bit in the can before you add them) 1 cup of barley one medium onion (diced) 4 celery stocks (cut up) one can each of corn, carrots, and peas. or any kind of veggies 3 cloves of garlic (chopped up) more or less your choice 3 chicken bullion cubes 1 tsp. parsley (fresh or dried) 1 tsp. cumin 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning 1/2 tsp. onion power 1/2 tsp. garlic power salt and pepper to taste Cook it all together for 1 and 1/2 hours. After the first hour of cooking add the meat and potatoes. you can always change or add different spices, veggies, or anything you like. once you have a stock, you can create anything! Well there ya have it! My mommy's recipe and I highly recommend it! I am eating it now!
