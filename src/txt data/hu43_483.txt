 infinite stratos custom armor
 Pilot: Shade Regene, 17 year old, black hair with red eyes. Nationality: US IS codename: Dark Revizer, a 3-3.5 generation custom-general-purpose IS. Shield energy: 1200. An experimental heavy assault IS with military features such as a sniper-like visor that flips over the eyes when needed. It was created by US scientists, but but was cancelled, until Tabane found it and repurposed the machine to the son of one of her very old friends, Shade. The legs have a blocky, bulky feel, similar to the Blue Tears. The legs have panels that expand out and reveal missile pods. Its armor is designed to be smooth, streamline, and sharp. It had a pair of stabilizer wings that uses HiMAT mode. The beam sabers are located in a large, diamond-shaped shield covered in anti-beam coating that is used on the left arm. On the right elbow is the head of a mechanical wolf with blue eyes, which uses Fold-Out armor to move over the hand and transforms into a beam cannon with moderate to high damage output. On his hip, he stores one Variable Heat sword mounted on the left hip called " Burning Fang", and one Variable Ice sword mounted on the right hip called " Frozen Edge". The Dark Revizer is a black midnight color with a blue lock-on visor and there are large blue sensors in each shoulder. The standby mode is a black visor with blue lenses on Neo's forehead. The One Off ability is Ryoshi Tenkan, (Quantum Transformation), which allows the pilot to become completely immune to physical attacks, but this drains the IS's shield energy when in use, so he can only use it in small burst. 
Come on, show me all your capable of!
