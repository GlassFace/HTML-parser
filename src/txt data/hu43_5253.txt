 ABC News does piece on video games, lulz are had
 Was kind of hopeful that @ThisGuy would respond to my post because apparently 'I didn't get it.' When...yeah, I get it and I also think I'm smarter but that's a whole other thing I'm not going to get into. Anyway....Anyone see the latest episode of Law & Order: SVU as of today (2/13) on hulu. It was basically Anita's story and Zoe's story mixed together and then taken to the extreme. Kind of interesting.
