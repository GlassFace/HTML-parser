 Rice
 Anyone here knows how to make the usual perfect white rice that Japanese/Chinese people make, with no flavoring involved? (well, perhaps a tiny bit of salt). I tried to find on the internet a recipe but there are countless recipes and I don't know which one is the one i'm searching for. I always tried to make white rice but it never turned out as it was supposed to be. As I understood, making rice is pretty tricky and you must do everything perfectly all the way. A tiny mistake can ruin it. So, if there is someone who is a real Japanese in here, you would be really helpful! Thank you! (:
