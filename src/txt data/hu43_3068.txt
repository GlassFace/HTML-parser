 Are you afraid of dying?
 I do not fear death. It is an inevitability. Why be afraid of what, no matter what I do, will happen? Being afraid of such an idea is rather useless because it will happen whether we want it to or not. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
