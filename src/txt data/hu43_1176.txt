[Action] Kill La Kill - Page 6
 As I've been saying elsewhere on today's episode: It certainly was an episode of Kill la Kill. I want to see what happens next in that it seemed like it was building up to that last scene, since the beginning of the show, but I'm here cliffhanging for the payoff that it didn't get to for that build up. At least the preview for next week seems like it will be the payoff. 
 And just as I say it last week, I have to take it back this week. Kill la Kill is here to save anime.

 I thought the cliffhanger for episode 16 came out nowhere and it seemed completely pointless as it was immediately resolved. So I was hoping for this episode to end on something more substantial, and holy crap! I also lol'd at the DTR scene, the look on his face!

 This weeks episode was awesome, did not expect that ending! The series is clearly gearing up for its climax. This episode did show again why Mako is just awesome! She doesn't have any special talents except for her courage and good will. That is always an exciting character to watch. Really looking forward to next week! 
 It's just like that futurama episode where the professor works under Mom for a while.

 Man, this show just keeps getting better. Did not expect that reveal at all. 

 Eh, this reveal was sort of predictable (and haven't even watched the episode yet). What I find funny is how much I think Ragyo looks like a younger Mom from Futurama.

 I was anticipating the twist when Satsuki brought up the discarded child. Yes the reveal was kind of predictable, but I think it was still freaking awesome just by the way the end scene pulled on your heartstrings. Liking it more than Gurren Lagann, a lot more.

I might as well post this before Ned beats me to the punch.  Spoiler

 Daaaaang. I feel like this anime just jumped in quality over the last couple of episodes lol.

Like Lady Satsuki in a rain of blood... Ryuko as one with Senketsu... Young Ragyo... Satsuki's father (and somebody else's... lol): All the Kamui's and all the wearers... And it appears that Lady Satsuki is not afraid to get her hands dirty in order to accomplish her goals... lol!

 Finally we're getting into the climax of the story. Satsuki's mom has a nice ass. Also what a tweest 
 Yeah this series has definitely improved as it has progressed. I did not see that reveal at the end of the episode coming at all. The series now is certainly reaching it's climax and it nice to see the questions from early in the series get answered. Now the vents of part one are making much more sense now. Really excited for next week! 
 I... I just saw this week's episode. Well, things escalated quickly. 
 Mako is doing that Pinoko face again, lol... Lady Satsuki will be back! Ryuko is a monster! Mako's dad found a surprise! Is this Nudist Beach's strongest 5? Mako in her birthday suit... Mako rejoins Nudist Beach... And the amazing Nonon... Nudist Beach version!

 Finally decided to catch up with the two latest episodes and dayoom they were so good. Can't wait till the next one. 
 
 Ryuko Rider! Takarada from Osaka! That evil lady... And yeah, spoilers...  Spoiler (Though I passed it off as crossover fan art on Facebook, where you can't hide spoilers... lol)

 I feel that all of the symbolism that was present in the first half of the show has just been dumped by the wayside, and I honestly don't know whether or not I like it because of that. The show's quality seems to have gone up, except for the story, which is just awfully predictable. I really hope the pay-off proves me wrong. ><; 
 
 It definately reminds me of (the aweeeesome) Tengo Toppen Gurren Lagann! 
 Yeah, that episode was very Gurren Lagannish! The best part though, was Mankanshoku leaping into action!

 Man does this show take me back to TTGL...and that's a good thing! With both the first few eps got me interested, then a few eps were shallow storywise, to much echi stuff and played out jokes. And then...just when I'm starting to think: "How much longer is this damn dum #@#* gonna keep....aaaaah here we go!" Had to let the style of drawing and humor sink in on me, and mos def had to let some characters (especially Mankanshoku) grow on me. And now I'm at the point where I can't wait to see next weeks episode... So I salute you Kill La Kill, I salute you 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
