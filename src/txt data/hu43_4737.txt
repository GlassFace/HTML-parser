 Spider-Man Finally Joins the MCU
 I'm not a fan of the recent Marvel cinematic universe, they're good movies but I don't like the realm's whole cash concept. I'm glad Peter Parker is getting love though, Civil War was a really good story arc. I love Spider-Man. 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils? Join Super-Powered and get in on the action!  Spoiler http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...-Super-Powered
