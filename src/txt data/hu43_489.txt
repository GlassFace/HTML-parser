[Adventure] Sword Art Online
 The only way to escape is to 'clear' the game. Death in game means actual 'death' ---- The ten thousand who have logged onto the as of yet mysterious game 'Sword Art Online' using their Nerve Gear have been forced into this perilous death game and are trapped inside. Protagonist Kirito, one of the many gamers, has greeted this 'truth'. He plays as a solo player in the giant castle that is the stage for this game ---- 'Aincrad'. To meet the conditions of clearing the game and leaving this twisted virtual world, he must get through all 100 floors. Will Kirito have what it takes to clear the game, or will he die trying? Two things that pop into my mind are: 1) .hack and 2) Hunter x Hunter (Greed Island arc), both awesome of course.

 Watched the first episode, and this is looking really good! Very similar atmosphere to .hack, but I think even better. Nicely thought out, as well. I laughed when Klein found out that Kirito had family living with him and his first reaction was to ask how old his little sister was... I would have said, "oh, then I'll give you my address so when you get logged out you can come save me". lol.

 It looks interesting, plus I like the art work, now if it only has a kick ass beginning song. 
 First episode was great, and the enemy defiantly has a god complex going for him.

 I immediately thought of .hack when I read this anime's description. I love .hackespecially //SIGNso I'm interested in checking out Sword Art Online. I found out that Kajiura Yuki is composing the music; a must-watch for me! *_* 
​
 Btw, does anyone remember that old show called ReBoot that use to air on Toonami--since I never saw .hack--this show reminds me of ReBoot.

 It was a greaat.! Its like a true game that you can play. 
 
 I hope the dude saying he was cute was a joke Other than that one little bit, it seems like it will definitely be worth watching. I can't wait to actually some action though. Oh, how the waiting sucks.

 It's an interesting premise. I really liked that aspect. The first episode was pretty much all exposition, though, so it's impossible to judge much else. We only have three characters introduced and the action, obviously, was very "level 1." Not sure I like that there are supposedly no magic classes. I hope that doesn't mean there won't be wide differentiation among character types. I give this an Optimistic rating.

 Just finished the first epsisode, and I have to say this....wow. Even though the story was written by the same person as Accel World, this anime seems to have far deeper and darker storyline, since this anime included death as game over, while Accel World only have uninstallation and memory erased as game over. I'll be really looking forward for the next episode.

 I watched the first episode, and I really liked it. Good story, interesting idea. I have got a few problems but they are reality type ones.  Spoiler My main issue is how are their bodies being kept alive in the outside world? I loved the mirror and how it showed them how they really looked, a lot of female characters turned into men. LOL

But, this still doesn't mean they suffer from lack of food, we could say, that maybe they are being fed through tubes as if you were in a hospital
