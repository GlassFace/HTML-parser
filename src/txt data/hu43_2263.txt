[General Discussion] Lies and Guilt.
 Have you ever lied to someone and felt guilty after? OF COURSE YOU HAVE! or have you? It might depend on what kind of lie you tell people? Maybe it depends on who you lie to? You might even feel good for lying to some scum you hate and not feel guilt. Ever felt guilty for lying?

 No not at all. 
 I guess it all depends on how big the lie is. 
 I don't think there's a person alive that never felt guilty even once after lying.....

Well you'd be completely wrong, because this kid is way edgier than you think: Originally Posted by Protoss No not at all. Anyway, yes, I'm human, so I've lied, and I'm not a sociopath, so I've felt guilty about telling some of them. I don't generally feel great about lying to my parents or significant others (assuming they don't lie to me as well -- another story; another day), but aside from a general discomfort in lying to a select number of people, lying comes naturally when I want or need it to, and I don't feel guilty in most instances. I will say that for the most part I'm completely honest, even brutally so, but I will lie if it benefits me enough.

 It depends on what kind of a lie I'm telling. Human beings have a natural tendency to judge themselves based on their intentions yet judge others based on their actions. Here's a particularly bad example of a bad offender. Let's say there is a man who has been married for 15 years, and feels very tired of his dull home life, and therefore cheats on his wife. He lies about where he went that night and hides the affair from her entirely. If he were a real *******, he could justify to himself that his intentions were to refresh himself and his marriage, so he could be a better more attentive husband without committing a real atrocity. This would of course be a horrendous case, but I've heard similar reasoning from people like this before. I've been guilty of telling bad lies with what I thought were good intentions before, despite being somewhat full of ****. Most of the time that I tell a bad lie for selfish purposes I'll feel pretty bad about it, although I have before felt justified despite being clearly in the wrong. 
 Every time I lie, I feel guilty about it. Doesn't really matter how insignificant the lie might be, I still feel guilty. Which consequently makes me a terrible liar.

 I t really depends how big the lie is and who I lie to. If lying will get me out of trouble I'll lie but if I lie to look cool or to impress I'll just feel stupid and it depends who I lie to if it's my friends I'm ok with it but if it's my family I'll feel guilty. 
Fool me once shame on you fool me twice f*ck you Patches 
 No, never because I do not lie about things I would feel bad about afterwards.

 Yes, which is why I make sure I do it right when I 'have' to. Gotta avoid that 'ladder of lies' pitfall. No loose ends and all that. Basically I have to plan out my lies these days, and all that premeditation ebbs away the guilt trip somewhat. With friends they just roll of the tongue. We usually know whats up and just go through the charade. The pharse 'whatever, you lying bastard' is often involved. My family know before they've finished the question if I'm gonna lie or not. Prompting one of my alltime fave/best comebacks - 'If you were just gonna call me a liar, why did you even bother asking me?' Its an artform, and I feel if you're gonna feel guilty than it ain't worth doing. Stick to bending the truth and leave it to the professionals/sociopaths and compulsive liars. Finally, 'honesty' is such an underrated tactic. Best employed before its your last resort, lol.

 Now that I think about it, I've never felt guilty about a lie. But I've felt stupid before or felt that later on the lie was unnecessary. Sometimes I try to lie to prove my big brother wrong about me being a bad lier, it never works, I always end up smiling. But when I have to lie I keep up a real good poker face, like when I skipped school because I wanted to sleep... 
 I never like to lie. In fact, when I first started lying, it would actually sends chills down my spine because I knew I was not telling the truth. Over the years, the chill has gone away and I can lie easily. But I still choose not to if I can help it. But it came to a point where in order to have any freedom to do as I wanted to do, I had to lie. Luckily, those days are gone. I do feel guilty about some lies. It's really more dependent upon what I lied about. If it was something small, I rarely feel guilty. But if it is something big and important, I do feel guilt about it. Which is why I try to limit any lies I tell from now on.

 Absolutely, in fact the first job I ever had essentially required that I lie to people on a daily basis. And I had little (to no) say in whether or not I could actually partake of said job, because it was under my strict parents behest. Of course that helped to dull the guilt associated with lying to others, I would (and still) nevertheless feel immense guilt for lying in the first place (though feeling unnecessarily large amounts of guilt may, in itself be a character trait of mine). 
 No, I have never lied and felt guilty afterwards. Only when I am caught do I feel guilty when I lie.

 I lie only when I have to protect my privacy and have some freedom. Otherwise I would end up being bombarded with so many questions and I am not really fond of that , but again who is? I am afraid of being judged by others and I dislike justifyin myself, which is why I lie about certain things. Small lies. As the rest goes I am honest and blunt. Mostly. Unless I don't want to hurt someone's feelings or I simply don't give a damn I let it go. Its easier.

 Nope, because I simply don't tell those kind of lies that would cause guilt in the first place. It is entirely possible to not be a stinkbutt human being and tell harmful lies. I find no reason to make up **** just to have something to tell. I've bent the truth on many occasions. I mean, if someone is going to bombard me with questions on things that are my business or my friend's, well, they are not going to get the full lowdown on my private life or theirs, so I pass it off with a "I don't know" or "I wasn't in the room at the time".

 I lie to make someone happy. But I don't do it a lot. Therefore, no guilt. Because those kind of lies don't cause that kind of feeling within me.

Also, just putting it out there; unless you lied about something you did that was completely atrocious (I'm not gonna give examples, you guys be creative) then I see no reason why one would feel bad about it. Unless of course they were caught in which case; yeh you're obviously gonna feel shitty.

Well, a person's choice to lie and it's merits are dependent on an individual's morals so it's clear that many will see telling a lie as well as the results of doing as such will be viewed, from their perspective, differently than how you would see it for example.

 Sometimes lying is necessary though. Like when your girlfriend turns around and asks "Does this make my butt look big?". It does, but she doesn't wanna hear that. 

 I've reached the point where lying no longer gives me any thoughts or feelings... It comes naturally now... But it's not like I lie all the time... Only when absolutely necessary...

 I don't lie. Not anymore, anyway. It's not that I feel like lying is evil and I'm above such things... It's just that I have no real reason to lie about anything these days.

 Generally speaking, no. I figured out ages ago that the stress of lying wasn't worth it, so most things important I just tell the truth. Occasionally I'll lie about something semi important, and yes I do sometimes feel bad depending on the situation. Heres a flip, have you ever felt guilty or bad for telling the truth! 
 uhh i generally don't lie unless i have to, so when i have to, i don't feel guilty about it. i'm not talking about petty lies like what you did last weekend or how much money you make. the times that i've had to tell a lie, it was to protect someone i loved... so under those circumstances, i don't feel the least bit of guilt. 
be. cause. you. don't. know us at all we laugh when old people fall. but what would you expect with a conscience so small?
