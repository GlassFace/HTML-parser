 My avatar uploader keeps saying it couldn't save image.
 I am trying to change my avatar, and it says, "It can't save image" or something like that. I tried another avatar and the same thing. I am not sure if I am doing something wrong, if I am unable to change avatars anymore, a site issue, my formats, or whatever. If I can get either some clarity or if there is an issue, can it be fixed?
