 Just Google. 
 Nikov the Iceman, very cool. However, let's talk about a weakness condition. I assume to reach his extremely powerful super-speed and amplified strength he'd need to freeze and absorb a lot of things or charge his power up by freezing something massive? That seems like a balanced weakness. I don't want something like, "Nikov touches a garbage truck and shatters it after a few minutes. He now has the ability to run across the city and back at incredible time, oh by the way he can kill an elephant with one punch". You satisfied with this condition? Lexie, my condolences regarding her tragic past, looks like a wicked character! I think I saw a Skullgirls illustration in that post, She reminds me of a Necromorph from Dead Space. What is this strength amplification though? A punch multiplied to have enough force comparable to a boulder or truck seems broken. You'll have to reduce that if you wish to keep the power. I'd like for superhumans who don't have extraordinary constitutions to at least survive a right hook from the girl. You understand my reasoning, yeah? Can Nikov withstand freezing temperatures, and what are the limits of Lexie's limb regeneration? ikov appears to be a regular guy who can just mess you up real good based off of your proximity to him. Lexie seems like a grueling monster, but she can still die from blood loss and heat stroke, apparently. 
 Name: Don Hubbard (Too much?) Age: Mid 30s Gender: Male Alias: The Divine Rector Power: The father, Don Hubbard, has the ability to manipulate the psyche of people that he's placed in a suggestible state. Or in other words, he brainwashes them. Turning people into his slaves, or "followers". The slaves are completely committed to the orders and wishes of The Rector. Even to the extent of dying for him. But their intelligence takes a hit and they enter a "zombified" state after receiving an order. But depending on the intelligence of the victim beforehand depends on the intelligence afterwords. Even how he brainwashes them can affect out they turn out. He uses brainwashed minions to do his bidding, and even become his personal human shields. Or leave them seemingly unaffected but with a single trigger word turn them into tools. However, for his powers to work, the person has to be in a highly suggestible state. Such as in deep sleep, or being drugged. He has fangs that excrete a venom that can put people in a sort of hypnotic/suggestible state. And he has heightened senses that give him a certain early warning system to possible threats. But they don't affect his reaction or reflex speeds. However, besides that, he has no fighting abilities. A simple bullet to the head, or slit throat is all it would take to kill him. Affiliation: Villain Physical Appearance: Don is a tall and Husky man. He has short blond hair, dark brown eyes, and a biggish nose. He always wears a sort of Clergyman type attire. White robes and an amice, with golden detailed edges, golden buttons. Most would assume he's a simple [insert biggest religion in Alpha City] Priest. Until he puts on his hat. During his "meetings", he wears a medium sized white wide pointed hat in a similar shape to a pentagon. It has a single golden enneagram star. "Super" Appearance: None/Looks the same Personality: Don Hubbard is a very deranged and theatrical. He's known to have mood swings and sudden outbursts. Shifting his personality from serious to laughing maniacally. Happy and well mannered to angry and violent. However, when it comes down to business, he shifts his personality to cold, serious and grim. Though he's most known for explosions of maniacal laughter and talking about the acts of God. It's hard to say whether he is a total psychopath or one of the smartest puppet masters in the underworld. Backstory: After the wrath of God caused one third of the world's population to be erased from existence, many people hated him. However, there were few who saw God and was hypnotized by his power. Don Hubbard is one of those people. His parents/Guardians and entire family died from different acts. Many times they were murdered right in front of Don. However, what Don saw was the will of God. Eventually this drove him into an obsession with this mysterious figure known as God. He inevitably began to believe that he was divinely chosen by God after his powers started to surface. On his own as a young child he would carry out "divine punishment" to those he considered evil heretics, using enslaved civilians to overwhelm the victims and rip them apart. Through this process he created some awful religious rituals such as sacrifices for atonement and self torturing in order to become stronger. Later in his life, he established an underground church in the Glam District, known as "The Church of the Chosen". Also writing a book he titled "The Holy Creed of God", or to his followers it's known as "The Creed". The book details about how God's judgement was really a gift to the world, bestowing supernatural powers to the few divinely chosen and strong. And those that have been chosen but do not worship God are fallen angels. Heretics who are punishable by death. Many of his followers aren't actually brainwashed slaves, but rather actual followers who have found the church in search for the purpose of existing. Even some who are considered part of the divine chosen that are devout followers of the religion. However, through some extent, their psyche is affected by Don, causing them to become more obsessed with the religion. But you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the brainwashed slaves and the actual followers until Don issues an order to them. He continues to search for a higher power in pursuit of becoming God, and participating in the many and vast affairs of the underworld.

 Yes it is based off skullgirls, but that not why I'm responding. I don't understand How she can be over powered. Her main attack ability is strength and out of her 3 abilities that's the only real attack, while the others are both cosmetic and defensive. We are talking about super powers right? So the questions is How can you have a character that killed a third of the world, one that can fly AND heal others, and yet I can't have super strength? So sorry, I don't understand your reasoning. And I don't understand where the hell you got regeneration for my character? I never mentioned regeneration and actually properly avoided that. 
 Er, are you upset? You said she can grow limbs on her body...I see that she can just transform back to her human form and erase any extra appendages. Her super strength is feasible, but not enough that she can literally kill a person with one punch. How would any hero be able to fight her then? It'd be unfair if given a close quarters situation your character's specs allow her to mollywhop someone with a one-punch KO into Hades. I'm suggesting you lighten her punches but still give her, in her transformed state, the ability of possessing incredible strength. Comparing it to the force of a truck is just too much. Do you understand how in the RP, where there are other characters who may not have enough physical constitution to survive a speeding truck smashing into their bodies, how you would be over-powered? I could say that the other characters could just dodge out of the way, but your character's agility and mobility specs are also really high. This isn't a bad thing, but it just harms any chance of someone avoiding a fatal blow from Omen when you're pvp'ing. You need any more explaining? I'm politely requesting you tone down the strength of your hits to a reasonably "super-strength" level. My one character who erased people from existence isn't in the RP, he was created for plot. Invalid example. My character Nimbus can only fly and heal people. He has barely any offensive capabilities aside from ranged tactics, which aren't really much when compared to Omen's devastating strength spec. Nimbus's healing is a modest strength and weakness, the flight is just cool. @4XDBLACK Character accepted. I would like for your mind control powers to be able to be shattered though. Permanent PC minions would just be unfair to the creator of that character. Is it okay with you if I say a high mental resistances will negate the effects of the hypnotic cripple the venom gives? The venom can still totally shred mental strength after resisting the venom though, or other forms of drugging The Rector uses like injections or gas. Also, you're saying that a smart person who gets zombified will become a bit slow, but still get their "smartness" back when the mind control wears off after they have recovered from their suggestible state? 
 I should have a character up by the end of the night. Can't bring any of my classics in unless i want to turn them bad. Eh, i'll try something new.

 For those wondering how villains will work, that's the beauty of it. I don't know how the player created villains will operate, given that they are free to create just as much reasonable content in the sandbox/framework of the city and the theme surrounding it that I have given it. Of course my bad guys have their events as priority, but that doesn't mean villains won't rise and fall with the tide of the story. Like heroes, you must create lore-respectful canon that isn't too outlandish. I remember one guy I RP'ed with just kept injecting intense Cthulu/Lovecraft and Warhammer 40k drivel into a RP themed similar to this one, and I mean intense. This isn't Wrestlemania, you don't just claim the plot like a belt.

Sure. Will power usually always trumps mind control/hypnotism anyways. To answer the second question: People who get brainwashed, after they receive an order their mind switches into a sort of zombified mode. They're almost mindless. Or rather, they become robots. They lose their human element. Meaning certain tasks are impossible for them. Like say, telling them to put together a puzzle. But more complex tasks can be done if the brainwashed victim happens to be of higher intelligence. Sorry, I think that part got a little jumbled up after I edited it a couple times. I think it might need a little tweaking.

 Originally Posted by Shmuser Name Er, are you upset? Yes I am somewhat annoyed because you haven't read my character sheet correctly. She does not have regeneration. If her limb is cut off then she's gonna be bleeding from where it appeared from. I'm quite happy to even almost kill characters and cut off arms and legs if need be. In WW4 I created a character that had 2 weeks to live cause they had radiation poison. He was vomiting blood and couldn't do much. As for the strength, as I said if she uses her power she gets hot and tires. In other words if she uses a full transformation then she's basically going to only be able to throw one or two punches before she is unable to fight at all as it will use up all her energy. She's a teenage girl after all. This is what I don't understand. You say we can have 3 powers, I'm only asking for one ability, super strength (not agility as that only explains how she has strength), and I can't get that. 
 Are you under the assumption that I'm not allowing you super strength as an ability? Dude, I totally am. Relax, I got your message right after you pointed it out. No regen, it's just that she can produce more limbs in her transformed state. When she reverts, it's like her previous form was erased to be created again once she decides to turn into the "monster" organism. Right? I have plainly said to you that you do in fact have the power of super-strength. However, your super strength is a bit too much. I'm asking you to tone it down, because if she is tired from the transformation she still has the ability to throw a punch that can kill another player's character in PVP. That sounds very unfair to me, and to you it means no one would want to fight your villain for fear of having their PC die, thus making her overpowered in the fact that she can legitimately end a PC's life. That's too much power, even if Omen becomes exhausted and useless in combat. I see you thought of her weakness while making your wonderful app. The problem I find is that her super-strength ability is just way too strong, and could be shaved back to reasonable yet still powerful means. I've already explained why. I was thrown off my the lack of bluntness in your character app regarding how her powers have drawbacks. To me, they were more like side-effects than weaknesses, so my bad for not reading your app perfectly clearly. You're confusing "he's asking me to delete my super-strength" with "please make sure your super-strength is still a power that can be contested in pvp because it's essentially a one-hit KO to most people" 
 I hope this is okay, I usually do something with way more information, but I'm kinda cracka' lackin', sorry. Name: Makila Maddy Age: 26 Gender: Female Alias: Fallen angel Affiliation: Neutral Power: leet 360 no scopes abilities. Just kidding. Makila can use the powers of the shadow to shroud herself in a black mist, cloaking her within an instant. She does not stay invisible for long though, just enough for her to slip away. She can also create a dark puple force field around herself, pushing anyone away and she can keep it up, burning anyone who dares enter it. But channeling this ability makes her weak. She also has enhanced agility/reflexes. Using either of her abilities grows heavy and dangerous for her mental health. Affiliation: Hero/Villain/Neutral Physical Appearance:  Spoiler She also has a katana, weapon she bought at a store, she was permitted to bring it for self-defense. She also has two weapon that were provided by the gouvernement, a scout knife, then again, for self-defense, and a sniper rifle. She was one of the best in the top 20. She made personnal arrangement on it to fill her own needs. "Super" Appearance: Her outfit. Personality: Being influenced by the weakness of her powers, Makila has many mental disorder, none of them were evaluated as she firgured her power at the worst possible time. She tends to stay neutral in conflicts or which one benefits her the most. She's a subtle woman, sneaky. Always doings things carefuly, without a sound. But she may also turn violent if she loses her mind after fighting too much. Backstory: Born and raised in a normal familly, Makila always had a kick in the art of stealth. Always sneaking up on her parents, taking other's things without being noticed. She had fun playing with other's mind, doing tricks now and then. Over the years, it became her trait, her best quality. Unseen and deadly to all. The feds needed someone like her, someone who could sneak in and out without any blood nor trace. She joined a special oganization, commonly known as black ops. Operations made under the radar, erased if anything went terrible. She did not work alone, in fact, her partner was just like her. They had code names, obviously. Her's being Angel and his, Fallen. Over the missions, they became attracted to each other and on and on, you get my point. On the day she realized she had super powers, it was too late. During one of their opperation, something went terrible. Ambushed by an unknown faction, he was shot down. As he slowly slipped away, they tried to take her away, but in vain for she used her powers out of anger, without realizing what she was doing. As he begged her to leave, she vanished, crushed by pain, sadness and shame. They disclaimed that they ever knew them, she was left alone in this world even after all she had done. But they kept her for vital researches. As we speak now, she is still in control in a lab... Or is she ? She may of also took his name in his memory. Who knows. Well, I do, obviously.

 @Shmuser: I sent you a PM regarding your concerns. I'm also going to be making a few tweeks on my character (not sure exactly what), I re-read my app and something about his personality or maybe his back story that didn't click the second time. 
 Credit to my hoe.

I have plainly said to you that you do in fact have the power of super-strength. However, your super strength is a bit too much. Ok, so if I can't pick up cars, throw punches that feel like a truck or break through brick walls then can I say I have super strength at all? To give you an idea, a Taekwondo kick produces 1040kg of force, which might I add is enough to break bones and the weight of a small sports car, and I'm not allowed to exceed that?

That's too much power, even if Omen becomes exhausted and useless in combat. This is the second time you've added information to my character that I did not add. I never said that she would be able to kill another character within one punch, and it would come down to the ability of the defending "writer" as to how a punch would affect them. A "Good" writer would never write another player into a corner where their character is forced to die. To be honest Even Iron Man has a strength of over 100 Tons and I don't see him punching people into pancakes. Originally Posted by Shmuser Name I was thrown off my the lack of bluntness in your character app regarding how her powers have drawbacks. To me, they were more like side-effects than weaknesses, so my bad for not reading your app perfectly clearly. Dude! It's over 35*C with 60+% humidity where I live and I work out in the sun, on a hot forklift, moving pallets and hand lifting boxes up to 30kg. The sweat that pours off me off me in the day is enough to fill a 5L bucket and I'm drinking that same amount in water... And you're saying that my character who suffers from severe heat exhaustion isn't enough of a weakness? It's a passive weakness. Something she has to manage because it can leave her vulnerable to attacks IF she uses all her strength. Originally Posted by Shmuser Name You're confusing "he's asking me to delete my super-strength" with "please make sure your super-strength is still a power that can be contested in pvp because it's essentially a one-hit KO to most people" I already did that, I already thought of that, I'm not creating a character that is going to go around killing people recklessly. You asked us to obey your rules and I believe I did so, along with every other character that has been submitted, but every one has somehow been overpowered? Please. These are supposed to be SUPER-POWERED people, people with powers that excel beyond what mere mortals can produce and yet it feels like I'm creating a magician to perform a few magic tricks. Because of this, I'm actually withdrawing my application and I apologise to all the others that entered.

 Withdrawing an application? Tsk tsk, that's just a bit of an overreaction if you ask me. I apologized for my first misconception about your app. Even if you didn't say anything, explain to me how a character who has the strength to break through a brick wall and throw cars does not have the capacity to end a human being's life with a single strike? I was being realistic there, instead of hypothesizing about the circumstances and conditions of the unclear pvp fighting of the future. In your terms, the future pvp conflict would boil down to one player being forced to respond to the attack of your incredibly lethal character with an action that would save their own from being struck. To be fair, even someone who gets slightly hit by one of Omen's blows would be very injured due to her crippling strength. To ensure that the pvp fighting is of a fair quality, I was politely asking you to tone down your super-strength by a dial to a more realistic and fair level. Apparently that's unacceptable to you, and I cannot understand why. Super-powered people can still be mortal, btw. You believe I'm not making superheroes appear to be as well cut out as they ought to be? Well, remember that this RP is a community game that involves balancing and reasonable limits. Honestly, withdrawing your application instead of further discussing the issue with me was a mistake in my eyes. There was no definitive command established, I was pretty lax and was responding to you quite evenly and respectfully in my opinion. There was still the possibility of you getting your way, so I hope you regret your actions. @Lillith Awesome character! I see you used Kasumi from Mass Effect for the picture. That's great, I liked her. Powers seem fine. She's basically a bit of a telekinetic who can use a "shadow blink" type of teleport and has the generic speed and reaction time increase, right? Accepted. I do hope she makes it out of that lab. Perhaps her lover is still alive? 
 Aw ****, I've been found out ! But yeah, and a bit of the N7 fury in ME3 online. And **** yeah she will leave that **** place lol. 
A calm . mind is the key to success.
 @Lilith You never specified what Makila's affiliation was exactly?

 I was waiting for more players. I'm pretty active on the forum, I also wouldn't just drop one that I invested a lot of time into without any previous warning. Give it a couple more days. If more players don't come, then that's fine. We'll start with a roster of existing characters and NPCs.
