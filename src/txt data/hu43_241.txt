 Lifting Veils: The Return [READ FIRST POST]
 I haven't been here in quite some time. I have lost weight and start dressing more feminine. So pardon me if I misformat the pics.  Spoiler ^ My ex-girlfriend Kara and I when she did my make-up. I love the job she did.  Spoiler After a workout to lose just 30 more pounds. Proud of myself. 
 Currently Listening To: "Been Caught Stealing" by Jane's Addiction! Things get better things get worse, Life's a blessing life's a curse! Current Weight: 253 pounds! Nothing new!
