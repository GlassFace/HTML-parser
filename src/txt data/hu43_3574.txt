 Vegeta vs Hulk!
 The issue here is that everybody is going off of "theories." The proof however is in the actual material being the manga, movies and anime Vegeta clearly gets his ass whooped by pretty much everybody. Now regardless of the "potential" to destroy planets, are we saying that because they Dbz characters didn't want to destroy the planets they were fighting on, they held back their power? So Vegeta could have easily beat Frieza, Perfect Cell, Buu, etc etc, but he sat there and let himself get beat up for the planet's sake? Vegeta may have the ability to blow planets up with layzoors and energy balls, but the manga, and anime proved that Vegeta royally sucks when it comes to hand to hand combat with anybody other than Goku. Which is in fact the hulks specialty. Also, while Saiyans get stronger the closer to death they are, the power is not realized until the are fully restored after that point. Meaning Vegeta would have to get beat down, then the hulk just sits idly by and lets him take a Sensu bean or some other way to heal himself. Based off they actual story when has vegeta ever done that?
