 11Eyes
 Recently finished 11eyes, For the most part I really enjoyed it, The characters in it were pretty fun to watch, The Rage-induced Takahisa, Split Personality Yukiko. I liked both of them, But Kakeru..For some reason I just didn't like him :/ Kusakabe reminded me of Rias gremory from Highschool dxd too, Overall I thought it was a good anime!
