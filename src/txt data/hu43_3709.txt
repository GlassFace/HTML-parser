 [GITS] Scarlett Johansson = Motoko Kusanagi
 I think she's a great choice for the character but this movie is so hard to pull of right regardless if the director is a scumbag with a load in his pants or a pro, I actually don't know the director so that's not fair. For fans like me who were greatly influenced by GITS will probably dislike it, and that's a high hope but it could do something for other audiences, thing is there are a lot of technology cautionary films coming out (chappie, ex-machina, T5 etc) and so I'm wondering if by the point this one comes out if this genre will feel over saturated. If it were me, I'd wait and invest on VR technology in theaters and then I'd release this movie with that tech, try and be one of the first titles to use it. Figure if your going to tackle such a kind of material like this, why not deliver it with the same flashy tech that's used in the fictional universe itself.
