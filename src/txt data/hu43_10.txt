 Video Games and Girls?????????
 Oh christ. I can hardly read that.... You know, if you use the english language to communicate when writing things on forums you will get more respect and replies. Also, girls are not better or worse than boys on video games. Girls might play -less- video games than boys, but how good you are at playing video games has nothing to do with gender.
