 Could you suggest some person transformation animes?
 @squid isn't that cream lemon? I thought that was hentai?? Ive heard of it I think I'll pass if that's what you're talking about. I'm not too sure about the mermaid ones. Maybe when I'm in the mood for loony comedies I might give it a go. Thanks for the others too.
