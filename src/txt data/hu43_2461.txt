 Kantai Collection(Kancolle)
 Kantai Collection [艦隊これくしょん] or "Kancolle" is a popular battle strategy online social card game developed by Kadokawa Games which launched back in April. The cuties in the game are moe-anthropomorphisms of WWII Japanese naval warships known as Kanmusu [艦むす]. Each Kanmusu's character and appearance correlate with the actual warships. For example, while destroyers are depicted as loli girlies, larger vessels like warships and aircraft carriers tend to be bustier with very noticeable oppai ^^; The battle is mostly automated and players take on a role of an admiral [提督] who organizes his/her fleet, gather resources and build an even more powerful Kanmusu to win battles. Kanmusu are voiced by popular voice actresses such as Saki Fujita (Hatsune Miku), Megumi Nakajima (Macross F Ranka Lee, Megpoid), Yuka Iguchi (Toaru Index, Haganai Maria) and loads more. Kancolle quickly gained players across Japan and has now reached nearly 1 million sigups. It's said that one of the reasons why it became so popular is because it doesn't require the player to spend their life savings on it like with other social games.
