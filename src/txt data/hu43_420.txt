 Bloody Rose Request Thread - Page 2
 I have been making graphics for 7 years and my set is always made by me to. I used to work for a band (not stating which as they're quiet famous now) making posters and such. I make Avatars, Signature's, Wallpaper and Banners. I make no animations. Only graphics that lie within photoshop. I will showcase 2 of each so you can get a feel. Of course it is all free. Request form to be found at the bottom. REQUEST FORM Type: (Avatar, Signature, Wallpaper, Banner) Size: (Size of the graphic you'd like) Picture(s): (As many as you like, but not to many) Text: (To go onto the graphic) Other: (anything else?)
