 Majin Bone
 Human. Aliens. Power Armor. Fisticuffs and special abilities. Sprinkles of romance, comedy, and dramatic social commentary. This anime provides... A decent storyline which has equal parts comedy and great CGI action, as well as touches of romance and serious social comedy. The cast of characters are modestly interesting, I can get slightly involved with a few of them but never not have a good time watching the major and minor cast interact with each other. The plot drives forwards smoothly, buttery smooth almost due to the constant arrival of good segues into action episodes, dramatic inner journey episodes, and comedy episodes. I am invested in this anime for it's guaranteed action and nice, not too heavy yet not so forgettable storyline. Watch this if you have the time, it's enjoyable and worthwhile if you can keep up with its steady rhythm. I believe it's going to be a long one, yet nothing too crazy.
