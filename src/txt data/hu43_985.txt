[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Man just finished the last two episodes, and I gotta say, the ending bothered me at first. But after giving it some thought and reading other peoples opinions. I actually think it was a good fit for the series. I just hope that they do another season or some sort of movie or big OVA on all the unanswered questions, cause I have a lot lol. It kind of felt rushed at some points, and the memories fading away could've been done better, but the action, excitement and ending made up for those minor points of critique. Great Anime! It had everything and more...it was different in it's own way, shocking at points (death of certain characters, plot twists and ofcourse the "rape" scene) and I loved it looks and music. So i'm wishing for more... 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
