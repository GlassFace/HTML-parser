 Japan outraged at ISIS Beheading of Hostage.
 Wow This thread has already dissolved into mud-slinging............. On subject though, We can't really do anything about it. Like some people said, if ISIS is wiped out, another group will rise up. Al Qaeda doesn't seem active anymore. Either that or I haven't been watching enough news, and have basically been replaced by ISIS as the terrorist group with the spotlight.
