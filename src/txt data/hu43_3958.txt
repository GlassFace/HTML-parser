 Suggestion (not sure if this is the right place)
 Hi, What about if when we hoovered our mouse over the changing anime images in the top, we would see the name of the anime for let's say viewing/research purposes? This could be a great idea for a newbie like me... I have started to watch "Kill La Kill" thanks to that short text on the forum top... What do you think? Bruno
