 If you could only listen to 3 songs for the rest of your life what would they be?
 So if you could only listen to 3 songs for the rest of your life what would they be??? Me? Bad - U2 Joyride - Roxette In The Air Tonight - Phil Collins I could live a happy life if those were the only songs I could listen to for the rest of my waking days. What about you?
