 Would you say the area you live in is dangerous?
 After looking around the PLD and saw topics like how do you defend yourself. I've decided to ask, is the are you live in dangerous? Although I consider my area dangerous, its probably because of my experiences. People have tried to mug me 8 times within the last 3 years. 4 of which they had weapons. I've been shot at by gang members once last year. So idk if I would call the area I live in super dangerous or I'm just at the wrong place at the wrong time kind of thing. It definitely is dangerous to go out alone or have your phone out in some cases though in my area for sure. But that's probably due to where I go and hangout. So is the area where you live dangerous to go out alone? 
When they see me rollin. They hatein. 
 It's not dangerous , not much at least , if you don't walk in the middle of the night or early in the morning you will be fine (when it's dark ).

 There was a fight at the chip shop earlier. A fish got battered. Not really unless you're driving or crossing the streets. There really are people out there that want to kill you with physics.

 Fairly. Lots of vagrants, gangsters, and random people who act fvcked up or tough. I haven't personally been involved in much, except having to deal with some jerks here and there, never got very physical yet. The worst thing I dealt with was a guy who got in my face and threatened me with a gun and stuff after I confronted him and some girl he was holding down in a dark park. Needless to say we were seconds from killing each other. But actually, in the end even me and him shook hands. I just feel bad for his wife, which apparently made abuse okay in his head and I should just mind my business, since they were married. A lot of people got shot in my part of town, but honestly, most people know or see me by now, they know I'm just a singing basketball chill guy, so luckily they leave me be. 
 Yes, down here everything kills you. :x ! From crocodiles to spiders. If not them, drugos would.

 I think my area is probably the safest place on the planet. A sixteen year old girl could literally walk around at 2:30AM half-naked if she wanted to. No place is explicitly dangerous, just don't be stupid and show respect for others. Don't really think this is a very "personal" discussion though, maybe more fitted for general chat.

 A brown snake went me last year and I cut it's head of with the shovel I was holding. It was poisonous, does that count? South Australia is pretty tame in general, despite being one of the serial killer capitals of the world... 

 Nope. Don't want to get too Geo specific but nothing really happens where I am so that's good. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 Deadliest thing around here are drunk drivers, what with living in a mildly rural area with a bar every couple miles, with many times more once you actually get into any town nearby.

 I would call the place I live "Dangerous" but like everywhere, when you live there you just know where and where not to go so personally I haven't been involved in anything, but that's most likely because I'm paranoid about that sort of stuff, so try to the best of my ability to avoid it. 

 I live in glasgow and its brand new here, very little danger unless your out in town at the weekend acting like a real idiot, even then i've found all is good.

 There've been guns fired, people killed, attempted hit-and-runs, and S.W.A.T. teams hunting down a fugitive, all just in the apartment complex itself! Fortunately, I mind my own business so no one really bothers me.

 All around is somewhat questionable, but nothing has ever happened in my immediate area.

 It can be dangerous. I keep an eye on the police blogs in the local papers and see what occured on which streets. Most of the time, the street I live on is OK. Be mindfull, though, as I do know one person who was sexually assaulted as she was walking up the steps to get to her apartment (don't worry, she kicked him for all it was worth and he ran off screaming). Oh, and although I don't consider it dangerous, do take care if you're out while people are shoveling. The snow is going to wind up on the street so try not walk into a pile of flying snow as it leaves a shovel.

 I wouldn't say my neighborhood is dangerous though a couple summers ago, people were stealing A/C units from people's homes. Other than that, it's pretty safe. 
 Pretty quiet n peaceful down here. To the point of having uneventful life

 i live in a small town by the sea, only like 1500 inhabitants during the entire year. Well, in the summer months the population grows like ten times but it's still safe. I've also lived in bigger cities all around the Balkans, and yeah it can be uncomfortable in late hours, but nowhere as near as you'll see in movies aka 'merica and similar. We fought our war 20 years ago, now we're chillin' and "enjoying" the capitalism we desired

 yes-the oceans are very dangerous-there are sharks and killer whales trying to eat you. 
 nope. No murders in the 2o years, I have been here, low crime, can't complain, the old people walk at night here, fearing none.

 Lately things have been quiet around here. Its pleasant, but a little unsettling. I guess management doing a shitty job with the upkeep on the apartments has caused a lot of people to just up and leave before long. Once we find a place we're getting the f**k outta here. Starting to think that we may be moving to Daytona from the way Noel is talking (Noel helps handle the finances).

 My area is kind of dangerous, but it's easy to avoid as long as you aren't walking around at night or 'hanging with the wrong crowd'. I have been beaten and threatened with weapons a few times and people do try to start fights with me on the odd occasion. But this very rarely happens and is easily avoidable. Most of the time their threats are empty anyway so it's over quick before anything happens. My area does have a bad rep and is known for being 'bogan', but it's nothing compared to some places around the world.
