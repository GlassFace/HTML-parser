 Any long term problems with using appetite suppressors like lipozene?
 I'm using lipozene twice a day during the week to curb snacking at work and to help lose weight. I don't use it at night and only once or twice on the weekend to stop binge eating. I'm not planning on staying on it forever. I've been using it since the september 13th and I've seen results. I guess I'm trying to train myself to not eat at work except for lunchtime and only my main meal not snacks. So I think what i'll do is stop taking it when my supply runs out and see I how go (got two bottles left i think). It's been really helpful because I tend to buy cookies or worse at the vending machine at work. So far thanks to this I've only bought salted peanuts once or twice since I've started. I have made real changes like eating more fruits and vegetables instead of junk food. I've also cut out one whole can of pop (soda) a day by switching to water at lunch instead of a diet mt dew. Those have nothing to do with the pills. But the snacking has and always will be a problem. I guess I"m wondering how to build up will power on my own when I stop using the pills for awhile. Suggestions? I know it's mental i just need to force myself to stay away......
