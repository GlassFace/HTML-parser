 Is Obama On Tv To Much
 It seems almost every day you turn the tv on you see Obama more than former Presidents. Also couple of days ago I saw on tv that Obama has had more Interviews and press than any former President and they where complaining about It. I think Its a good thing he's listening to questions and staying active. I guess there point was he should be handeling other matters, but whats more Important than going and listening to the ppl. Do you think he should lay back and stop holding so many questioners, Is he on tv to much?
