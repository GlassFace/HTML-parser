 Well hey, nothing but an amazing anime scaring the fuq out of me with terrifyingly pedo-rated faces by the titans. FUQ.

The trickle of information we get in the manga is obviously carefully written that way, so changing that pace seems like changing the story itself.

 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

 I was in a rush in my last post, I didn't post what I fully wanted to say. Anyway I went back to the manga and I take back my previous comment. Though I see how they cut a bit out now. Also this is funny for those of who that read the manga and once the anime catches up. Those of you that know what an abnormal titan is XD. I don't believe this is spoilers, if it is then tell me.  Spoiler

 That was a really slow episode. Rivaille is cool but jesus they really didn't progress anything at all. 

 Episode 9 began slow but that ending was awesome! Can't wait until next weeks episode 

 OMG yeah, I can't wait to see what happens at the start of the next episode! Lots of great reveal about Eren's past in this episode.

 NO MANGA SPOILERS!!!! Make your own thread in the manga section if there isn't one already I don't care if it's in spoiler tags. Anything that is in spoiler tags in this thread shouldn't give anything away except for what's happened in the anime so far.

 What! No fair! Off to the manga section then!

 I can't see how anyone would fall in love with such a great anime. Episode 9 actually made me mad when it was over because I wanted MORE!!! 
 How can you end an episode like that? Seriously HOW?! Im screaming "YOU F words all over the place HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO MEEEEE" But damn what I'm glad I watched it now, so I can watch the new episode tomorrow. 

 Yeah, episode 9 ended like "wth?" haha. It was a pretty awesome ending though. I have just finished watching episode 10.  Spoiler I love how Armin finally realised that people rely on him more than he thought and so, stopped being a whinge. I like hero Armin, the one who stands up for his friends. Of course he's most likely going to be a key person in figuring out what is going on with Erin once they get to that basement, since he's the smart one. Hmmm. I wonder if the commander who came to their rescue knows something we don't.

I wonder if the commander who came to their rescue knows something we don't. I agree with Shannon.  Spoiler Armin was always convincing himself that he was basically a burden to Eren and Mikasa. I wonder whats down the basement and why did Eren's father kept it a secret.

  Spoiler About time Armin stepped up...ABOUT TIME Ive gained some respect for him after that speech. As for the episode...meh not bad but not fantastic. 

 I'm waiting for it to finish airing because I HATE waiting for new episodes of anime to come out, but what I have seen looks fan-****ing-tastic 
 Armin's real good at thinking under pressure. Shame the anime seems to be trying to pace things at 1 chapter to 1 episode though. The internal monologue bits really dragged and just the pacing in general kinda killed the anxiety and emotional build-up for me. 

 ya it kind of seems like they are stretching the episodes out which do ruin some suspense for me. the internal dialouge and speed of the show reminds me of naruto in ways. this is a much better show though. it does feel like armin is going to be a really likeable character from here on out 
"I'll say it once more. I am the mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!"
 And I was thinking, 'Why aren't escaping, rather than just sit there having tea and deciding what to do for a good 10 minutes' Attack On Titan is really enjoyable. It was the second episode that blew me away with how brutal it was and how terrifying these Titans were. Certainly looking forward to the next episodes. 
 Love official crossovers. Also: http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FN..._animation.gif 

 Ha I so want that hand held. Like really. 
 Episode 10 took way to long to accomplish almost nothing.  Spoiler Armin is going super saiyan, i get it... So lets save humanity and **** and go to the basement.
