[Action] Isuca
 This little sister who's so much better than the older one (as per cliche), who's also stoic and blunt, I just can't with her. Wow, after that bath scene she just steals the guy, who was knocked unconscious by the power of vagina? Oh boy, doesn't she just have no dignity for her body. RIP random guy and shotgun bro, you both died for the sake of plot. I actually liked the kiss circumstances, they were so ridiculous that they were good...and that twin-tailed ass. Have fun getting home you slut. The newest enemy, the one with the silly hat, seems a bit bland as of the moment. Why do I commit myself to watching average to decent anime every season.... 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils? Join Super-Powered and get in on the action! Â Spoiler http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...-Super-Powered
