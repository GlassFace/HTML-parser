[Personal Life Discussions] Need Some Help With a Topic for a Speech (Business)
 Hmm, I like the kickstarter funding thing too. It's a good, new area. Since you don't have a ton of time, there's probably not a lot you can cover, but all the non-traditional financing mechanisms are things people love hearing about. If you compare it to the other more traditional options where you go to a bank and take out a loan or have to find private investors to be partners/shareholders with, you'll see loads of difference. I also think the rise of the remote worker is another interesting trend. I've worked for a few companies now that allow me to work entirely from home. Some of them don't actually have office space for everyone either, so if we did have to have face to face meetings I showed up at my boss' house or a restaurant, etc. This trend is because collaborative tools like skype make it really simple to work with everyone. So, technology might actually slow/cause declines in other areas like commercial real estate.
