 I'll give Bioware one thing.

So from one viewpoint, kotor is dnd based, and from another dnd viewpoint it is not. Originally Posted by Pokota This game is a monster.

I suspect I'll have to play through again to get everything right. Also, I second this. I'm finally nearing the end of the game, but I've skipped -huge- parts of the game. A -lot- of sidequests. Just because I wanted to see the story... And I've finally begun figuring out how the system works... So the -next- playthrough I might be able to create a better party...my current party sort of...lacks...something.
