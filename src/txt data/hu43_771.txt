[Action] Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan) - Page 2
 Episode 2 picked up where the first left off. Great action and good dialogue makes me want the third one even more. Yeah the part with the dad/key stuff left me clueless as well. Maybe he know the titans weakness or something?

 WHoa Nice!, those cosplay outfits (are they even Cosplay outfits? seems like it can be worn as an everyday jacket too) look awesome. Well now that I've read a lot of the manga, i Can sh*t is about to go down, and it'll all make sense in due time! But anway I can kinda see how the episode seemed like more filler then anything, but I think the next episode will be sorta filler then anything. But Yea I did enjoy this episode, it was good. 

 @ Ixiorian - I read your post, however all I can say is the version I watched was labeled "commie'. No idea if the commie release was official or not, or a v1. However they literally were talking about "bit coins" and other nonsense in the version I watched. I assumed it was a spoof, but couldn't be bothered to watch another version. The animation told the story well enough. As for semantics about the word Titan - Yes, the Greek myths were the first mention of the word afaik. However in modern usage it is a synonym for anything large --> http://thesaurus.com/browse/titan?s=t Following this, the word Titan fits as a synonym for giant. On grammar.... my Japanese skill is quite limited, so I have to assume you are right about the translation being in error. Anyways, onto the next episode.

 Well the manga has been just under OP in sales figures for over a year, so yeah. Pretty good reason to expect it to do well! 

 After watching episode 3 i feel more in love with Shingeki no Kyoujin , all is beyond my fantasy and did not expect the anime to be so good! Im really curios about the song which started playing at the end of episode 3. 
 
 Well episode 3 wasn't as epic as the first 2, but I didn't expect it to be so I can live with it.  Spoiler At first I was kind of scared that Eren was the determined "I'll show you all" kinda brat, so I was glad it was an equipment malfunction lol 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 The fun part about episode 3 is considering whether Mikasa or Jean intentionally messed with Erens equipment, or if it actually was just some kind of fluke. Mikasa obviously doesn't want him in harms way and thinks the entire revenge fantasy is foolish at best, while Jean is jealous of Eren's closeness to Mikasa and think he's a suicidal idiot for wanting to join the Scouts. Yeah it wasn't the most action packed episode, but a good introduction to a number of characters we'll be seeing from now on. 

 Mikasa is now my waifu.  Spoiler Dat face. It's like, "Yup, just flying on strings, no problem. Easy." Also,  Spoiler their instructor seems to have know Eren's mother. Interesting to see how that will play into the story. I want some sh*t to happen. My body is ready. This is also why I hate watching airing anime.

 Well considering this anime is over hyped. I've watched 3 episodes and besides animation this anime doesn't have all that much going for me. The story is blah and I don't see myself caring much for the characters so I'll be dropping it. Edited: Just as with Bleach, the initial concept is interesting, and such as with Bleach I took that initial concept and made it something interesting instead of the crap fest that is currently Bleach. I'm not saying this will be anything like Bleach, most things aren't. Either way I'll probably thing of something interesting and make it my own with the initial concept of giants and what not.

 I'd recommend watching one more episode unless you're absolutely convinced you won't enjoy it. It did take a while to finally get to where it is now, but it was important to establish the characters and just how terrifying the titans are and how powerless humanity is comparatively. It was meant to set the tone of the show. I'm pretty sure the next episode should be pretty action packed. Also, disliking characters isn't a great reason to drop this, it's going to be a blood bath so no one is long for this world. 

 That's the thing, I'm not into blood baths like I once was, I may give it one more episode, but I doubt my reasoning will change. Plus I bet Potato girl will get killed in this blood bath.

 Potato girl is now my second favorite character. I'm still not sure if I like the main character or not. Sometimes he just seems to SCREAM "shonnen protagonist". However, I had a very real flash of empathy for him, as I went thought the exact same thing as he did in episode 3. No, I wasn't training for a squad of giant-killers, but I was trying to learn how to ski. It got to the point that the girl trying to teach me finally just gave up. I got to the bottom, said "$%@# this, I'm going to the bar," and discovered that my ski boot was broken, which was why I kept veering to one side. I still went to the bar, though, so I failed my shonnen protagonist test.

This may be a spoiler, but its sorta not, really..(that make sense)  Spoiler O potato girl doesn't die in "This blood bath" And Mo, Manga is just.....just amazing.. oh my god. I'm caught up, and you just won't believe all the crazy stuff that's happened TRUST ME the story is great, and things in anime will def get more " heated" (pun intended). Im sure the next episode will be GREAT. You need character development MAN.

He's a typical teenager; he thinks he can take on the world and win, and that just isn't the case whatsoever. 

 Originally Posted by MoSteel Maybe a bit over dramatic but other then that this kind of reminds me of a Marvel or DC comic. So a good story even though Marvel and DC do superhero stuff that I'm not into. Oh Mo. Thats a better Introduction Well see, i can't keep up with all of the new anime's!

That is the determination i love about this serie so much, he want take on the world if he was some scared boy i wouldnt like it. And im a huge fan of gore/bloody anime so i feel bad for anyone who want drop this anime. However i hate to wait a whole weak just for a one episode.

Like Haru from Accel World for example. I watched it through to the end even though I hated the main character, cause he was crying and being sobby all the time. At least Eren got the guts and mentality.

If I'm current with the series, nothing in a spoiler tag should be a surprise to me. This is not that big of a spoiler, but still, I just want to make sure everyone's clear on this.

 Yeah do not post manga spoilers here guys, feel free to start a thread for the manga if there isn't one already. Spoilers should ideally be used for content from the latest episode, so anyone can pick up the thread from the beginning and by following the dates of the post, easily be able to prevent themselves from being spoiled.

I'm a bit tired of people winning just because they believe harder than anyone else. I guess that's kind of why A Game of Thrones was such a breath of fresh air in the fantasy genre. With that in mind, I'll give the main character a chance.

 Potato girl is best girl...also 
 @ShikinamiDesu You can also find me on Hummingbird! 
 I read the manga within a day - its really good - original and terrifying - my only point of critique would be the flasbacks that go over several chapters - I really dont need to knoe what happened during their training - at least not in this lenght 
 I love it so far, the potential of it being a really good series looks goo so far. I want out an bought the manga after watching the first few episodes. I love the gear they use to get around.
