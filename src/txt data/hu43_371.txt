 [Spoilers]Death Note : Did you agree with Light by Episode 37? - Page 2
 Anyone here seen the movie There Will Be Blood? My favorite movie of all time. And the Kira situation is almost just like that. Mr Plainview is a man with good intentions in the oil industry, and through his own corruption and his own abuse and gain of power...  Spoiler He ends up beating a priest to death with a wooden bowling pin by the end. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Ur milkshake. I drinkz it. 
 I likes what he was doing at first. I don't know the exact episode... but eventually he just went power crazy, and abused his own justice system. Also, everyone's idea of justice is different. e.g. K and L.

 I agreed with him early on. I stopped agreeing around the time of L's death. It's already been said, but he became that which he was fighting to destroy. 

 Watching the series wise... yeah he was doing the right thing just so the viewers can be entertained haha. If you are talking about if Light and the Death Note existed for real.. he should have just kept himself hidden. L was smart to talk all that **** on live television, because Light isn't a god, he is a human with human emotion. So L knew that it would draw out Light to try and compete with L instead of going into hiding, just because he knew from "Kira's" attitude that he hates to lose and won't let anyone talk him down. Kira wants to prove to the world that no one can beat him. To answer your question if I agree with him by episode 37... Hell no! I know it sounds twisted to say I agreed with his decision from the very beginning... just as long as I am not the one who's killing people (; His decision to wipe out L was a mistake. 

 I agree completly with your theory. it points out clearly how light's fall started after he got the death note 
 I support light 100%!! 
 I agreed with most of his decisions, except for the L one. Though I do reckon from that decision onwards he started being careless because he thought Near & Mello couldn't catch him because he figured they were inferior to L without realizing that if they worked together they were on par with L (Not is awesomeness but on an intelligence level ) So I agreed with him till episode 25, then I didn't because he was so careless.. 

 Throughout the whole series I wasn't worried about Light or L or any of what would be considered the main antagonist and protagonist. I was worried about his parents. Good god, what kind of stress does he have to put them through for him to be considered a spoiled brat? 
What will it take to enlighten you? I've gone passed the edge and I'm already broken; How do I climb back to the brink and put myself back together again?
 To be honest its hard to say because you have to know the world is a messed up place with greater horrors the most can even comprehend because the real evil is not talked about on t.v nor written about it books etc.... so although light methods seemed evil and for all purposes they were evil but I truly think to combat evil you have to be willing to become evil. Is it the right choice maybe not and personally i enjoy being a good person and would not be able to do it but at the same time I realize one cannot combat evil ( A force with no mercy and no rules and no compassion or hesitation) from the point of good which is the exact opposite ( mercy and tolerance and forgivenes and second chances). In the end each has to make up their own mind and light made up his and as you could see all crime almost stopped and though it was due to fear and not true peace it really is the only way. True peace can never be attained in this world because there is to many opinions and to much greed and pride and hatred for people to get along. It does not matter if we were all the same color and same culture etc we as a people would find a small difference and a reason to divide and hate and war its in our dna. Although not all our dna some truly enjoy peace but again it comes down to good over evil. The good will always be ran over by evil due to its giving and forgiving nature the key for good is to not get taken in be evil and stay true to yourself. Anyway it is not the route I would have Taken though I still agree with his methods in a way and understand his way of thinking. After all people claim to be individual but in the end we are all just a product of our experiences from the people we meet to the lessons we learn to the friends we have and yes in a situation we have a choice but the choice you make is not exactly yours because the choice you make is no more then that of what you have learned to that point. the only reason some one would make a different choice is because they had different experiences and lessons and for that reason different principals in which to base their decision from. If a person the exact same as you lived the exact life you lived and learned the exact stuff you learned they would likely make the exact same choice. The only difference between a rich person and a poor person, a good person and an evil person is the situations and lessons they lived in. ask yourself would you be the same person if you were born poor with no friends or food and beaten everyday with no help comming as you would be if you were born rich given everything you want and need. people like to judge people but at the end of the day we are all the exact same people just fool themselves into thinking we are different. anyway end rant because i could write a book on this subject if i had better grammar skills 
 The thing I found interesting about Death Note is that there was no true protagonist or antagonist. It was just the plot and the mystery, yet it melded together so well and the characters were so well thought out that it became incredibly popular. The only person who could be called an antagonist in my opinion was Ryuk because he manipulated everyone so effortlessly, killed his own brethren, and ended up betraying Light in the end all just to be a troll. About the only antagonist whom I can think of that out-trolls him would be Yuuki Terumi of Blazblue.

 Under the right circumstances anyone can become a murderer. Initially I understood Light's rationale but I never agreed with it. The decision to kill criminals sounds noble and in some ways it may have even sounded like justice. But there is no justice in any punishment where a person takes away something they cannot return or replace. And then the ending. By the end of the series Light was no longer killing criminals. He was killing people tasked with attempting to protect and serve law abiding citizens. That wasn't a greater good, it was a cover up. End of story. May he rest in pieces.

 I initially did agree with Light and the way he did things until he got corrupted, but I suppose if L and the police didn't interfere he wouldn't have gone on a killing streak of murdering innocent people but then the story wouldn't have been any good so meh. I was still rooting for him though xD would've liked a 'bad' ending o-o matter of fact, I would've rather seen it end after L died since the part after that was a big drop in the quality of the story in my opinion.

Lots of people would probably love to kill off all the violent criminals who pose a threat to others OR would turn a blind eye to someone murdering those criminals. But the thing is the moment you murder these criminals you become no better than they are. It's inevitable that Light would've had to die. Either he needed to kill innocents so he could kill criminals or he would've eventually realized he was no better than the criminals and committed suicide or he would've become no better than the criminals and someone would have to have killed him. I would've liked it more, if Misa hadn't been mind****ed, murdered him, and then lived happily ever after.

 I was a Kira supporter. But after seeing his actions, and thinking for myself, I didn't know what exactly to think of him. It was a good idea to kill criminals, and create a safe world, but he did kill innocent people. And by killing criminals himself, he technically is a criminal. And even if he did kill off all the bad guys without killing the FBI agents, the world would still be corrupted. I mean, just think about those weird-a** Kira supporters. They scarred me more than sadistic Light!

 Pretty hard to agree with most of the crap he pulled in Part 2. I think his character looked weird from the start (though anyone would be confused in that situation), but if I'm being honest I wouldn't hesitate to kill L or Naomi with them as threatening as they were. Like others I'd have gone that extra step to wipe out the task force as well (Soichiro too), but that's an afterthought

 I think with proper medical attention Light would of been alright. He was smart, but should of realized killing everyone he doesn't like is not the answer. To be honest I think the Shinigami (just LOOK at that guy!) corrupted him, because he seemed like a decent person at first. I can't relate this to the real world since there was actual Death Gods, meaning there could of been Light Gods and Angels and such as well. Death is not the end in the Death Note anime (L's spirit watched as Light died, or maybe he imagined it?). So killing them is completely pointless since they will still exist and maybe even reborn to be a criminal all over again. -_- 
 No, the manga does go out of its way to state that death is the end. The anime attempted to end things on a less embarrassing note for Light I guess. And it did do that, but I dunno how seriously I should take that L spirit stuff.
