[Horror] Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (Parasyte -the maxim-) - Page 4
 these episodes feel way to short 
Understanding 100% of anything is impossible. Thats why we spend all our lives trying to understand the thinking of others. Thats what makes life so interesting. 
 That was a tear jerker. Shinichi  Spoiler finally showing some kind of feeling is refreshing. The ending though...who the hell is that prison dude??? 

 (ToT)/ Poor Tamura! Why didn't she fight? This is so sad! She was an awesome character! Why the hell only annoying characters have the right to live?? First Kana now Tamura!! The baby giving up scene was so Heartbreaking! Damn!! The pervy serial killer looks interesting. 
  Spoiler "If the king does not lead, how can he expect his subordinates to follow?"
