 Most Disgusting thing you have ever eaten?
 Title says it, brah. What's the most disgusting dish you've tasted? My mom is this crazy russian lady so she has all these really weird dishes she cooks. Some of them are actually really good, but a few times she's cooked a cow's tongue; like the whole tongue. And it not only looked bad/texture was bad, it also tasted ****ing disgusting. Ah childhood. 
 When I went to England, the hotel we stayed at had free breakfast (WHICH WAS AMAZING! I TOOK LIKE 10 MUFFINS OMG!!!) But then for dinner we bought a pizza from the cafe/pizza shop inside the hotel, made by pakistanies. (why is everyone in england a pakistani? where are the poms) ... ... I think it was a ham and cheese pizza? The (Pizza?) was some, flourey, dry dough, which tore apart in a not so nice way... It had super dried ham that looked like it was out of date (like the one I just ate now, out of a premade box thingy), but drier... and powdery... Oh, and we can't forget about the ... ... cheese? I don't remember seeing any cheese if my memory is correct, but if there was it was MINUTE and I seriously mean... MI ****ing NUTE. And ofcourse, the most important part... The invisible sauce between the base and the toppings. We didn't eat the pizza after 1 bite each.

 Egg Plant is easily the worst thing I have ever eaten. I couldn't eat it past 2 bits.

There is a pizza a place in my town that basically only makes pizza that sounds like what you describe, also its expired. And the craziest part is that they've been in business for over 30 years now! 
 For medical reasons, I had an insane craving for a peanut butter, syrup, turkey bacon sandwich on wheat bread. It smelled like heaven. It did not taste like heaven. The texture was horrible, the crunch of the bacon and the crunch of the peanut butter..... And the syrup was semi everywhere. And the taste of the peanutbutter was pretty overwhelming 
Should've opted out just before the point of ejaculation b1tch. ~ Snap

It was even better than the ones I ate in Italy and Croatia. Anyways... They were so amazing... then they sold the pizza store to some indians or malaysians i honestly don't rmemeber, their pizza was almost as bad as what I described earlier, we never went there again and they went out of business PRETTY damn fast, they sold it to some other people, but we don't go there anymore since it will never be the same ;_; They were EXTREMELY expensive though :s but the taste o3o

 Let see. Most anything my friends mother made was not good. And meat was either under cooked under seasoned or over cooked. I remember we went over for dinner and we had meat tougher than beef jerky and red. Like raw meat red. She would also make us drink something called noni. I do not remember what it tastes like, but my sister remembers it tasting like mustard in Crystal Light.

 By mistake, a moth. Thank carnival rides at night for THAT little adventure... On purpose, huevos rancheros. I can't stand runny eggs, and with very rare exception, do not like salsa with my eggs. Both together was like a nightmare sandwich topped with nausea with a side of OMGWHATWASTHAT?!

 I usually don't go for conspicuously bizarre stuff, so my list of foods is pretty short. I hate innards and organs in general, I've had it A few times unknowingly and never developed A taste for it.

 I hate cucumbers and watermelons...and I don't like cooked cabbage. Whenever I tried these I had an urge to vomit. 
 Mushrooms, no question. Just the feeling of them on my tongue is enough to make me gag, never mind trying to chew 'em and then do the nearly impossible and swallow them. Sometimes I'll have fewer issues choking them down, but other times I just gag too much and put some peanut butter and honey on a piece of bread and wrap them up in it. Much easier. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

I tried sushi... I like the seaweed and the rice part, soy was fine, but the raw salmon... it was stringy and chewey, didn't like it. If it was weaweed + rice + soy + COOKED fish, I would love it.

 Squid. Not only did it look disgusting but it tasted horrible too, but it was a family dinner that my aunt was paying for so I couldn't just say "ew no". I felt sick for days. 
 Fishloaf. Like meatloaf, but with fish. 

 The most disgusting thing I've ever tasted was vegemite...it was horrible...the taste lingered something awful >.< Originally Posted by Chunibyou Title says it, brah.

Japan is number 1 awesome and I wanna move there and I cannot wait until I finally get the eat the number one best thing in the entire universe after raman and *finally gets to try it*....om om om.........Weeaboo phase ends there... Yeah...I hated sushi. It ended my weeaboo stage years and years ago when I first got to try it, because it was that bad. It was suppose to be the best most delicious thing in the entire world and every friend I ever knew loved it like it was water and when I tried like 4 different kinds....they were the most putrid things I ever tried. Including the ones without the fish.

What about Mushroom Heads Struggler ~_O Hmmm not bad but weird thing I have eaten/drank was pizza... blended into a liquidy paste with extra sauce... for what it was it wasn't bad but pretty damn weird. Just to answer the why question I will say you get pretty desperate when all meals are taken through a straw.
