[Personal Life Discussions] Why are you Single? - Page 3
 I've been single for a while, and for a couple of reasons I don't have time for drama. I'd love to adopt a child without the bullcrap that is marriage, and it has nothing to do with freedom of sex. I just don't want to deal with drama. However, a single male looking to adopt a child is grounds for pedophile suspicion in this day and age, which is a shame because I really love kidsI had this 1 perfect girlfriend. She was everything I wanted in a relationship. Soon, she just moved away. It hurt, but whatever. In my mind, no other girl could possibly compare, which is probably why I rejected all comersI'm here on A4. Not many girls really dig Otakus (jk) Anyways, why are you single?
