[Slice of Life] Isshuukan Friends
 Kaori Fujimiya is always alone because all of her happy memories, including time spent with her friends, disappear every Monday. Deciding that he wants to be friends with her anyway, Yuuki Hase tries to get close to Kaori each week, wishing that she would one day call him "a friend." I have heard that this manga is really good. It will be a 12 episode anime series, and the first episode is already aired.

 Sounds like a version of that 50 first dates movie. It might be cute. When I start to get further down my watch list I might get to this one. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 Yeah, kinda reminiscent of "ef - tale of memories" as well. (I mean by the description. I still have yet to watch the first episode though I have it loaded and ready to play.)

 great first episode. Do you not feel the feels yet? I have high hopes for this.

 I'll check it out, I'm ready for another school life comedy. I don't remember the last one I watched. It's been a while 
 It's basically Renji and Chihiro's story from EF. I like the animation and VA's so far. Looking forward to the rest. 

 I was looking forward to this the moment I saw it on the list of shows coming out in April. I enjoyed the first episode and am looking forward to what the show is going to bring to the table. I am expecting the 'feels' to kick in at some point as well.

 An anime Full of FEELS.

 Hopefully this anime will be memorable.

 I know. Gotta try em when I have em. Especially if they're not horribly offensive. Really though checked it out last week and the anime seems nice enough. I also checked out the manga and it didn't really strike me as having lots of strong feels either.

 Dude episode 2 I was cringing the whole time, every week you gotta question whether or not she'll remember him. And that last page...all we get is "God Please..." ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? WE GOTTA KNOW WHATS ON THAT LAST PAGE!!! 

 Fujimiya is adorbs! <3

 Episode 2 was interesting. Why didnt she keep a diary before? 

 Drat, I always tell myself "You shouldn't try to keep up with an anime series that hasn't been finished yet, you know it will only make you frazzled if there is a single week without a new episode. And you know that if the series is... good, you will avoid most others until it is finished." Curse you Ned. Also, this series is enjoyable thus far, the animation style reminds me of Usagi Droppu (to some extent). Now I am curious to see how the manga looks in comparison.

I mean Hase is dedicated to Fujimiya because he is obviously attracted to her but he also intends to be her friend every week. So he was able to find out about her condition in that week span and helped her out by telling her to keep a diary. However you notice she was skeptical about keeping a diary, so it's not out of the question that someone in the past told her to do the same thing.

If I'm right, we'll probably get an episode/manga chapter at some point with a reveal that she still has an old diary, had previous friends, and everything blew up for her anyway.

 Not as bad as I thought it would be. I did really feel it was necessary to jump on the feels train...and I kinda enjoyed it actually, they worked things out amongst themselves, and their bond grew. BUT NEXT WEEK!!!!  Spoiler SAKI JOINS!!!!

 That was a feels train that was the walk to the feels train station haha, I feel that this show is going to put a big feels bombshell in the next few episodes. I love the art style and the concept of the show itself. Really really good
