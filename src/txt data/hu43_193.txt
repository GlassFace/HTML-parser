 Seitokai Yakuindomo
 Plot Summary: Takatoshi is a new student in a recently gender-integrated high school, and is asked to join the student council as the vice president. Thus begins his days as the only normal boy among 3 female student council officers. Episode 1 hasn't been subbed yet. It sounds like a reversal of Kaichou wa Maid-sama or Green Green. 
 This anime is the best I'm seeing since it still have episodes to be released.

 This anime is kind of weird. First a guy comes to an all girl school, well ok. He does not come to get 'laid' or something but just for studying. Now we have the student council where 2 of them are perverted thinking girls, saying random perverted stuff all-day, we also have a midget beeing also in the student council. Is their a story ? No. It just follows their daily life, this mainly involves talking random stuff most of the time. And the guy is a pussy, no offence. He is not even an inch attracted to the girls in his school, which is rare beeing an former all-girls school. The anime somehow reminds me to Haruhi Suzumiya or Angel Beats, however it fails when comparing them. In my opinion it is the random average slice of life anime of the season.

 Its like a reversed Seitokai Ichizon. I like it though.

The lack of a story doesn't particularly bother me; but then, I also liked Lucky Star so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised hehe.

That's what I like about it; they aren't using the tired cliche setting. I like how the guy is painfully normal, and I especially like Hagimura's scenes. The bit with the guy asking directions or whatever really made me laugh when she was shouting at him heh. The "Suzu's Head" pointer also gives me a chuckle. I haven't laughed this hard at an anime since the English dub of Ghost Stories lol. It is weird, but I like it. Very amusing. How can you not laugh at scenes like this: 
I've only been wrong once in my life, and that's when I thought I was wrong... but I was mistaken.
 I have seen up through episode 6. I haven't watched the last few episodes because I forgot about it.

I like the President and Shichijou whenever they talk about perverted stuff. It makes me feel less freaky since I also talk a lot about yaoi at school. That episode where Shino was competing at a judo match and a BL scene suddenly appeared was really good. lmao

 Probably one of the funniest animes to come out in a while. With no real plot it gives more chance for completely random comedy, obviously all being sex jokes. Favourite one by far though has to be the beach episode, mainly because of the "its gradually getting bigger" scene. 

 Guess i placed this one in the wrong 'genre' Originally thought this would be something like romance/slice of life/comedy with an actual story. Made a big mistake should have placed it in the K-ON/Lucky Star/Hayate Combat butler series. 
 "Create your dream, live your dream, be your dream"
 Ah what a great episode. Who wouldn't want the real santa to fly over and give you a vibrator for xmas? 

 Only one more episode :sigh: 
 Its just not fair. This was probably the most enjoyable series this season. But oh well, when its all over we still have Motto To Love-Ru coming shortly xD 

 every anime that has "Seitokai" in it makes me laugh lol

 Yeah They still need to release another OVA 

 This series was so damn funny I was disappointed that the anime ended after only a few episodes. With this, I can look forward to many more sexual innuendo jokes in the near future.
