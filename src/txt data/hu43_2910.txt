 [REQUEST] A snake sig
 A4, I need some help. Because of my job, I rarely have enough time to sit down in front of photoshop and GIMP and make the sigs I have before. With that said, would somebody make me one? I want a signature with a green snake in it. Its important to not the snake must be green and it must not be a king cobra. If somebody could make me one, I would be ever in their debt. I will be sure to label your name under it when I use it and give proper credit. 
 It was only a matter of time... Now I am one with the night and stars again... Thank you, Rhyme's Law, for your signature art work.
