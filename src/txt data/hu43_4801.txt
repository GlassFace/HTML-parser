[Anime] Anime that makes you think
 I've somehow managed to miss watching lain so far, but judging by the almost universal recommendation I'll fix that ASAP. Got a 3 day weekend coming up, and the weather forecast looks pretty bad, so I'll probably stay in and marathon some anime. lain and utena I'm thinking. @Kerberos everything from your list that I've seen has been something I've liked, so I'll definitely look into the others. @Zoltor Do you have a favorite from the studio pierrot list you gave me?
