 Favorite Game No One Has Heard Of
 What's your all-time favorite video game, any console, that no one has ever heard of? I love Granstream Saga, an action JRPG for the PSX that had to compete with FFVII. Blocky graphics, great story, actual beautiful anime cutscenes and addictive gameplay. You can download a rom, but that would be wrong! (*wink wink nudge nudge bob's your uncle*)
