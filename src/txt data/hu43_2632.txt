 Jojo's Bizarre Adventure
 First started watching this show back in November and I could not stop watching it. Its actually a pretty good show and the animation isn't half bad. I love the second story arc with Joseph and Caesar. I do plan on reading the manga since Viz will be printing a hard cover starting this February.
