 [Video] Photoshop Tutorials
 Hey guys, as promised, I finally finished my very first video tutorial going over some of the basics of Photoshop. The video itself is almost 22 minutes long, but I try to take my time to explain the necessary details of all the tips and tricks I go over. I do plan on making this a series of videos for beginners, intermediates as well as expert Photoshop users. Enjoy! DNS Photoshop Tutorials #1: The Basics DNS Photoshop Tutorials #2: Selections
