[Supernatural] Hanamonogatari is out!
 Now, I don't expect to be as professional or on par with the legitimacy of most New Anime Thread creators, so I'm treating this as a place-holder until somebody makes an actual thread for the anime. Thoughts on the pilot: All I can say is: The pilot was a bit underwhelming, but retained it's charm of animation, illustration, and enjoyable dialogue. The ending really hooked me, it made my unsatisfactory attitude towards the beginnings of the pilot into satisfaction for the entire episode. **** Ougi, and **** this new girl that Suguha meets. Man, I miss Araragi....
