 Whats your daily excercise?
 So you wake up, do your basic stuff, etc. Do you go for a jog in the morning before heading off to work/school? Do you jog at night or afternoon? Or are you involved in some sport? I'm curious since I nowadays have no time to even jog anymore in the mornings because of school and debate. I used to be involved in TaeKwonDo for the past two years but this summer I slacked off and stopped going completely because of school. This has affected me a lot ]; And now winter has hit in and I find it too cold too go jogging but once my winter break hits in i'll attempt to go jog in the mornings and prehaps get myself back in Tae. How do you guys manage to put in 'excercise' in your daily schedules because i'd love for some tips on how to manage time for this. Also i'm curious as to what kind of daily excercise A4'ers get.
