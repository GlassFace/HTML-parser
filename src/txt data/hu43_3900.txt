 ABC News does piece on video games, lulz are had

Maybe at some point this whole thing was entertaining, but now it's just annoying. The harassment will never stop. The SJWs have simply moved the goalpost too far on what constitutes harassment at this point. Essentially any contact which does not agree with their opinions is now classified as harassment. I mean hell, Twitter even included a reporting option for this: See that at the top of "What are you reporting?" It's grouped together with "generally offensive" and "disrespectful" comments. Anyway, ABC has made a mockery of journalism and I'm glad that they made this report in the end. Gamers have always been on the fringe of society where it's acceptable to bully, bash, vilify, and generalize them, so why should the year 2015 be any different? Sam Biddle seems to have gotten his wish with his "bring back bullying" comments, except the bullies now aren't middle and high school students, but mid to late 20's/early 30's "journalists" who are bashing the people they're supposed to be on the same side as. It's their way of being progressive because video games cause violence or something.
