It was basically Anita's story and Zoe's story mixed together and then taken to the extreme. Kind of interesting. What am I supposed to respond to? I don't agree with death threats or rape threats, I'm also a GG supporter, those things are NOT mutually exclusive although Sarkeesian and company would love for you to believe they were. I don't see how some fringe element probably acting on BEHALF of Anita (who as we've both established has the most to gain from her victimization) is my responsibility to answer for. The truth is that Anita and company will not commit to an open debate because everything will come crumbling down once voices of reason and logic break through the vocal monopoly these idiots hold. A bunch of asshats in the games journalism industry got caught carrying out blatantly unethical behavior (it's not even disputable) and despite all this chaff they are throwing out about "greasy neckbeards throwing a fit about their boys club" we've seen nearly EVERY single journo site backpedal, alter, or create ethics requirements as a direct response to the GG movement. We're getting exactly what we want, now it's just a matter of showing the false academics like Sarkeesian for who they are: hacks, liars and con-artists who rely on a routine of victimization rather than intelligent debate in a broader "marketplace-of-ideas." The episode of SVU does nothing, it brings nothing to the table. Mentioning or including a topic (Gamer Gate) in media does not equate to adding to the "conversation" (which consists entirely of a corrupt group of people screaming "nazis and misogyny" over a historically fringe social group). The episode inaccurately portrays everybody, it goes further and invents **** that didn't happen convolving fiction and reality on a very real and serious topic that many are being introduced to for the first time through the show. The subsequent biased coverage on this episode has done nothing but throw salt on wounds and tear at the community as a whole. It's all about views and clicks, social politics (which were shoehorned in by academic slouches in the feminist community) will likely remain popular in the media for as long as they can ride that train. These people literally blame all men for atrocities committed and REALLY believe that videogames are an agent of male patriarchy perpetuating violent oppression of women, of course they don't have any convincing arguments or hard facts to back this claim which are all in direct conflict with statistical data showing that violence against women is down, violence as a whole is DOWN, and there are far more women represented in more fields than ever before. So what do you want to talk about? Or did you just want to wank about how smart you think you are? 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 Jesus **** there are actually people who thought the Law and Order: SVU episode was anything even close to the events that have occurred? First of all Anita is not a game developer. She's not even a gamer. She's a sex-negative feminist social critic and a terrible one at that considering she makes mistakes frequently and never corrects them, turns herself into a trope (the damsel in distress) for attention, and takes an entirely non-academic approach to her research despite claiming that her series is supposed to be academic in nature. Zoe is a talentless hack who is also not a game developer considering her only contribution to games is a click and navigate story about a depressed person. 13 year olds have created better game materials, but she gets praise and hipster welfare from Patreon because she's a woman. Talk about patronizing women in the industry much? Punjabi was portrayed as a woman who is intelligent, talented, and motivated to make video games. She did not want to be scared away from the industry. She refused to cancel an event because of a credible threat, while Anita eagerly cancelled one (the speech at the University of Utah) because of a threat that was anything but credible considering it was made from a different continent. Oh, and there's also that little detail about Punjabi being kidnapped, raped, and eventually quitting the games industry because of it. Did that happen to anybody in gaming? No, sorry, try again. If you want to talk about female game designers, you could look at Roberta Williams, Amy Hennig, Aya Kyogoku, Manami Matsumae, Jade Raymond, Alyssa Finley, Rieko Kodama, Brenda Louise Romero, or plenty of other talented women who have contributed to gaming. Anita and Zoe are professional victims whose entire livelihoods depend on them appearing to be victims. It's ****ing insulting to use them as examples of women in gaming because there are women in gaming and they're not standing around crying about how there are no women in gaming. The Law and Order: SVU episode was stupid, fearmongering piece of garbage and only a fool would have anything positive to say about it. Please get help Milkchan because if you really saw a dramaticized version of reality in that episode you're probably at a pretty serious risk for joining a cult. 
 My two valuable cents. There a lot of inherently wrong things with SOME videogames, tell me there isn't some feeling, big or small of shame or guiltiness or something when you rip open Scorpion's chest in Mortal Kombat X and shove a knife into his dangling heart, it's ****ed up but the violent and other awful behaviors of these people in this article are not caused by the games. I have played violent games since I was a young boy, I've killed women in games, ****ed them then ran them over with my car to get my money back but it wasn't because I felt I needed to fulfill some deeper sexual feeling or something else messed up, I did it out of sheer curiosity, there was word of mouth that this thing was possible, so I said no way but tried it anyway (this was GTA 3 back when). How many times have you ventured out to some place you know you shouldn't go, see a movie you probably shouldn't, word goes around and you just want to be in the loop. Forbidden fruit is how I look at it, I know I should stay away but I won't grow and learn otherwise. I have a loving mother, a supportive family, a community all during my childhood life, we were healthy in body and mind, we lived outside of our bedrooms with our controllers. I've enjoyed some of these titles which some believe to create criminal acts but because of the reasons mentioned above and then some I have control over myself, I don't let these games get to my mind, I'm respectful with women, I served my country and I'm doing great, a valuable member of society. These men are the issue, something in their lives ain't going right plus the internet has given everybody a silent voice, a way of shouting out without fear, I listen to Colin and Greg Live on Twitch.com/kindafunny, and they've said a number of times how most of these comments are complete bullshit when they actually talk with the people that post them. The piece didn't seem coherent all the way through where these games are bashed but then they talk about strong female leads in the gaming world, don't you see some of the changes happening here. In summary, these guys are just plain screwed up and with a good upbringing I am proof that these games aren't the cause and there's more to video games than GTA. I leave now with a picture of the oldest female videogame hero that I can think of.

Well that makes no ****ing sense. All I said was that the episode exists. Jesus. What's wrong with you people? (Dumb question really...) I don't really have anything worth while to say to a bunch of guys who have sticks up their asses about the whole thing. From my perspective, you guys fit in with the "ass-hats" who have a hand in all of this.

 Yes, Milkchan, saying ridiculous and untrue things online will get you called out. Welcome to the Internet. I see you're trying to backpedal on what you said now, which makes little sense to me because it's clear in writing above. You compared the SVU character Punjabi to Anita and Zoe. I said there's no comparison to be made. For the record, implying I'm responsible for the harassment Zoe and Anita have received is a pretty underhanded tactic and I suggest you avoid it. If you want to call me an ass-hat that's fine, but saying baseless things about people is wrong. 
 Hahaha. Serves you all right for forming opinions and posting in this thread. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro?

Buddy clearly didn't read your post, But frankly I'm not Buddy and you specifically chose to engage me directly: Originally Posted by MilkChan Was kind of hopeful that @ThisGuy would respond to my post because apparently 'I didn't get it.' When...yeah, I get it and I also think I'm smarter but that's a whole other thing I'm not going to get into. Anyway....Anyone see the latest episode of Law & Order: SVU as of today (2/13) on hulu. It was basically Anita's story and Zoe's story mixed together and then taken to the extreme. Kind of interesting. I've been over the fear of being wrong or otherwise looking like an idiot for years now, you'll find that I'm fairly open to decent argumentation. If you have some new earth-shattering evidence or viewpoint by all means lay it down, I've always been willing to reevaluate my position on any given subject given intelligent conversation. Buddy's response was stupid because it's clear he didn't read your post and was spring-boarding off my response to the SVU episode, but your post was worse because you're using Buddy's response as an excuse to leave after specifically asking for my response. Don't throw a b!tchfit because someone else said something stupid and then leave whilst making parting jabs about how intelligent and better you are. You asked for my response and you got it, the ball is in your court: show yourself the door whilst desperately reassuring yourself of your superiority, or prove it by making whatever argumentation you supposedly intended to give. Frankly I think you just made both of your recent posts to wank about how great you think you are, and really I'm not threatened by it. EDIT: nvm it was I who didn't read your response thoroughly, you were comparing the episode to the real life counterparts they supposedly were trying to portray. I was completely off with regards to Buddy's response, Buddy's points are well made.

She compared the woman in L&O SVU getting raped and beaten to Anita/Zoe having mean things said to them online. That's what I was responding to. Thanks.

 In my gender studies course, we had to watch a video by Anita. The whole time, she gave no evidence to support her assertions and people just accepted what she said at face value. My issue was that she made such huge accusations like playing a female character in a game if you are male makes you sexist by default because you are controlling that female character's sexuality and actions. It's a video game. That female character is actually lines of code. How can an individual be oppressing women by controlling a line of code made to look female? Needless to say, I disagreed with everything Anita had to say. That and she used the phrase "trigger warning" many times and that has always irked me. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OPossum | Homestuck
