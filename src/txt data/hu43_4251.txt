 Where would you rather live?
 A city. I've lived in small towns in the countryside all my life. After visiting cities, I'd like to move elsewhere and experience more. I really loved Montreal, but I'm terrible at French. I also liked Toronto. I just loved being able to take public transportation. Not something I grew up being able to do. I'm planning on moving overseas when I graduate. I'd like to move to Hokkaido, which surprises a lot of my friends. There's a lot of places I'd be cool with living in temporarily though.
