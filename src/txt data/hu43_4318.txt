 Skyrim, and What I Think of It (Not a Formal Review)
 Truly I didn't know if the "problem" still exists or they have fixed it. I played Skyrim when it was released, so I had the fortune to see some bugs in this game. In any case it's a fantastic rpg even if I don't consider it the best! My favourite rpg is Dark souls.
