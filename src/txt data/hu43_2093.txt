 "It's all about family -- really."
 Yeah I think it's very interesting! I didn't check out your links yet before posting this, but I def did notice when I was younger(and now) in the credits where animation sequences are made. from shows like dexters laboratory, to the boondocks! 

 I too have been aware of animation being supplied to American productions and Japanese anime by the Koreans, and the Koreans are terrific. The Japanese got so good with TV animation back in the 80s and 90s that they did the animation for Tiny Toons, Batman, Peter Pan and the Pirates, etc. The Koreans, learning from the Japanese animators, began to supply some animation to America as well as Japan. It's quite remarkable. The Americans only did hand-drawing animation in feature films like Dreamworks, Disney, and other Independents in the 90s untill 3D digital took off. So TV animation hand-drawing, Japanese style and influence, is of course alive and well in Japan and Korea. Now China and India is trying to learn it and perfect it in their own way and fashion. It's quite fascinating. Btw, check out a couple of examples of animation for the American Production The Lengend of Korra (pencil tests) by the Korean animators: Here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph2-sA_GcR4 And here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEAaPi7IxFs

 "It's all about family -- really."
 Btw, while Tokyo Movie Shinsha (the large Japanese animation studio that has done Lupin and hundreds of other anime over decades) was doing animation production of Tiny Toons and Animaniacs for Warner Brothers production studio, TMS was also working on the Lupin film Farewell to Nostradamus. While the studio was active on both Japanese and American animation productions they did some sneaky tributes between productions: "Buster and Plucky's expies appears in Lupin III movie 'Farewell to Nostradamus', this movie was done at Telecom Animation Film, The TMS animation studio for foreign cartoon and anime movie at the 80's and 90's. In the same case, they put Jigen as a farmer in Animaniacs episode "Sir Yaksalot" also made by Telecom." http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMaYG3tl3dI How really good was the Japanese animation studio Tokyo Movie Shinsha in those years? Well, check out an example of TMS animation for Peter Pan and the Pirates by Fox network (don't judge all of the images in the opening credit because its a mix of other studios in theses cuts. However, the full episode after the credit is all TMS animation). Some of the animation staff were trained on Little Nemo In Slumberland movie so you actually see a similar design, style and smooth movement in Peter Pan & the Pirates, and if you ever get to see Lupin III "Farewell to Nostradomas" and or "Fuma Conspiracy" you'll notice the same smooth and stylistic motion qualities paticular to TMS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acyhUAbcmxc

 Another example of terrific Tokyo Movie Shinsha animation is the American/Japan production of Cyber Six in the late 90's.
