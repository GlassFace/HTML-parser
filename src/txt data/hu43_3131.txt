If youre going for the random story on your way to the main "battle" type anime i would suggest durarara! its about a kid who moves to a new town and there are a couple different people it centers around. Magi is on my list already, I watched episode 1 and I liked it. I love its Arabic theme and feeling. Gonna add Durarara, this is also not the first time I hear about it.
