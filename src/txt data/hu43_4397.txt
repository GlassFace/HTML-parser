[Extended Discussion] thoughts on atomic bombings?
 So I know this might be a bit of a biased question, but what do you guys think about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Ive heard people defending them as nessarcy strikes agaisnt a determined enemy on industrial cities. And ive heard others say it was a blatant war crime like the firebombings. Becuase most of Japan's buildings at that time where in more of a traditional style made from wood and paper and highly flammable. Also I've heard the argument be made. While I dont agree with this myself that the bombings led to Dont use this as bias but I will day that my personal opinion would be that they should have pressed there advantage and whipped the accursed race off the earth in one well planned massive genocide. Thoughts?
