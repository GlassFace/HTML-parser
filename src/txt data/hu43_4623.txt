[Anime] What do you think of harem anime? - Page 2
 I know that there are a lot of people that like it but I can not understand the appeal of ever other anime being a harem anime. A harem anime usually has a male main character who is as boring as dirt, but for some reason he has a herd of beautiful and interesting girls that want him. Wash, rinse, repeat in different ways. It's not even a fan service thing because while these shows have fan service in then it's nothing to cry home about. You would do better to watch an henti or ecchi. Harem anime is way over saturated the only one I ever liked was "The World God Only Knows" and that did not follow the typical formula at all and actually had something interesting to say. However, so many harem anime come out every year that a lot of people must love them why is this? It can not only appeal to boring guys who wish tons of girls suddenly fell in love with them for no reason?
