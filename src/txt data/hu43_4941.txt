 Original Piano Piece - Refrain
 Decided to come up with another little piano piece. I decided to give it a bit more structure. I kept it pretty straightforward and simple, but thanks for listening. https://soundcloud.com/alcaknight/or...-piano-refrain

 That was really nice. Very soothing. How do you record your work? I play piano myself and have wanted to post my work but the best I could come up with is using 2 adapters, an audio cable, and $15 digital voice recorder.

To record I just hook a midi cable from my digital piano to my PC, then I use a VST called Synthogy Ivory to record. Originally Posted by tinahopo It's nice to listen!!
