[General Discussion] Which is the best party activity?
 Never Have I Ever is always interesting to play. It's a great way to get to know new friends and embarrass your current friends by calling them out on embarrassing incidents. Odds Are is another great, embarrassing one. The premise is that one friend tells another, "Odds are you won't ____" and the person who is being dared will give some odds (1/15, 1/10, so on) and if after counting to three they say the same number, the person dared has to complete the dare. Does that sound complicated? it's not, I swear.
