[Action] Mahou Sensou (Magical Warfare)
 I'm starting to fall behind on this (just a few episodes). The extremely rushed pacing is really weird, and has been since the very first episode. Every episode is more like a preview than an episode, lol! I've been iffy about the show since seeing the first episode because of that, but have hung in most of the way. lol.
