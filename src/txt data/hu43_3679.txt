 More Russia sanctions to provoke dangerous situation in Eu
 yeah, realized that when I got to the edit. who knows what Russia's aims were there. Ukraine wanted to join the EU, they were running out of money, and Russia didn't want them to. So he gave Ukraine's president a bailout. And that's how that who thing turned into that taking of Crimea. Lots more conspiracies that it's the US destabilizing countries, trying to box Russia in, etc. It's been a slow moving train since the end of 2013.
