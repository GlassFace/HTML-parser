 End of gay ban in U.S. military a step closer

If I could change the way the soldiers on today's military feel, I would. BUT NONE OF US CAN. Eliminating DADT isn't gonna automatically make every homo in the military be accepted by every other soldier. Like some magic wand. The sad but true fact is: Homosexuality, for the most part, is NOT widely accepted inside the military. The vast majority of the military is very conservative and intolerant of homosexuality. None of us can change that, but that doesn't mean I agree with it or think it's ok. The military is not like the public. It will take that social group a LONG FUKING TIME to accept homosexuals. Heck, even a large percentage of the public don't accept or tolerate gays. DADT is to protect homosexuals more then anyone else. It's so gays CAN join the military! Does anyone even remember the day gays couldn't even JOIN?! It's not like no progress is being made. It's too early, too soon. DADT protects military gays emotionally and physically so they can concentrate on defending our freedom.
