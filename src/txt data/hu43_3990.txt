 The Year of Gamera!
 So, for all the Kaiju Fans, as you all know last year was the 60th Anniversary of the King of the Monsters. For me, it was a time of much celebration, with a new Godzilla Movie, An announcement from Toho regarding an all new Japanese Godzilla film, and the announcement of Pacific Rim 2. It was a good year for Kaiju Fans. 2015, of course, is the anniversary of another classic Kaiju- Gamera! So, inspired by Kaiju-Artist for IDW Matt Frank, Kaiju fans of determined that for the 50th Anniversary of the original Mutant Turtle, there should be a year long celebration! So, in the spirit of the year of Gamera, let's discuss our favorite (and not so favorite) moments in the Gamera Franchise!
