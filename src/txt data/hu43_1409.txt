 The Chatbox
 Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. All of A4 rules still apply to the chatbox. Joking or making up crap about sex, suicide, rape and similar WILL get you a chatbox ban. Cybering is forbidden on the forums and via PM. This also includes the chatbox. Even if moderators and admins are not online, we do take the time to read the chatbox and there have been reports of incidents. The chatbox should be fun for everyone regardless of what their member status is. No one should feel weirded out by topics discussed in there. There is no need for it. 90% of the time, the chatbox is great, and people are having fun. We will be issuing bans going forward. If you feel that something is happening that breaks any of the above, please forward a message to a member of staff indicating the time of the incident (with your timezone) and it will be looked into.
