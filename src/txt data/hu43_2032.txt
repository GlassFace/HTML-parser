[Anime] 3 Reasons Why Fate/Zero Is Better Than Your Favorite Anime (Without Spoilers)
 Quick! Think of an anime you really, really like -- something that's close and precious to you. Maybe it's one of your first shows or maybe it's just something you really enjoy for reasons you don't completely understand. It's probably a show filled with characters you love, a story you really enjoyed, and just basically got you excited to keep watching. Got it? Good. Now, I need to tell you something: "Fate/Zero" is probably at least twice as good as it. And for the vast majority of you it's probably more like 100 times better. A statement like that takes a lot of gall, I know. Who am I to tell you that your favorite show is markedly worse than Fate/Zero? What does this show do so well that makes whatever you chose look like finely polished crap in comparison? Can't you just like what you like? I'm not really talking about personal preference here, I'm talking in terms of objective, tried-and-true, time-tested and respectable ways like cohesion, theme, and just basic writing mechanics and how they're used. Besides, it's completely fine to love something that's objectively bad if it makes you feel happy. Who cares if Naruto is an aimless, meandering clumsy mess? Who cares if no one really knows what the point of Bleach is or why it's main character doesn't really have a goal and is completely unrelatable and boring? Who cares if Shakugan no Shana is unapologetically taking advantage of hapless virgins and closet pedophiles? If it makes you happy then no one can take that away from you. Unless you actually like Shakugan no Shana. Then the police will. But Fate/Zero is still better. And, without getting into spoilers, here's a few reasons why. 1) The Entire Cast Is Interesting (And Crucially Important) If somehow you've made it this far without knowing Fate/Zero actually is here's the rundown: For quite a long time rival organizations and families have been gathering ever few decades to duke it out in Japan to decide who gets the Holy Grail. The Grail itself is understood to be omnipotent and pretty much limitless in power, and if you "win" it you will have a wish of your choosing granted. In order to participate you have to be chosen by the Grail itself, meaning you have to have some reason to seek it out in the first place, and upon being chosen you will be able to summon a magical companion called servants from history or legend to fight for you. Your servant will be one of the set classes that take part in every war, like the archer, caster, or saber, and it's up to you to outsmart and outmurder the other masters in order to win the Grail. Just understanding the setup should clue you in to how critically important it is to have interesting and well thought-out characters. Every Grail War has 7 masters and 7 servants, meaning that right out of the gate you have at least a guaranteed 14 characters to get to know (and there is more!). Anyone who has written anything probably understands how daunting something like that would be and how easy it would be to completely **** it up. "Man, don't I know it!" But Fate/Zero doesn't **** it up. In fact, every single master and every single servant plays an important role in telling the story, exploring the overarching theme (more on that later), or helping other characters grow. Hell, a few of them do all those things at once! Even minor characters with seemingly no importance are there for a reason, even if the reason doesn't reveal itself until much later. And the best part is that pretty much all of them are understandable and believable, even the guy who calls himself the King of Heroes and thinks that every treasure on the planet from every time period belongs to him and only accepted a summons to the Grail War to keep everyone else from taking what he believes is rightfully his. And that's because they're consistent, and any story worth a damn has that going for it: consistency. The key here is how crucial the entire cast is, though. If any one of them were absent the show would suffer for it and would probably have to clumsily make up for it somehow by altering another character to a silly degree. Even the most obvious wildcard duo, caster and his serial killer master, serves a purpose despite the fact that they're in the Grail War without knowing (or really caring) about it. They're pursuing their own agenda and seemingly play no real role in the war itself despite having been chosen by the Grail, but even then their activities play a major role in why the rest of the cast do what they do and the consequences of their actions fundamentally shift the direction of the war. And is the precursor the first "OH SHIIIIIT" moment in the show. That's all well and good, but even the best and most entertaining characters can't save a bad or fundamentally flawed show (see: Soul Eater). Their performance would be pretty pointless if they weren't contributing to something bigger than themselves. And that brings us to... 2) Everything Serves The Theme (Even When It's Not Very Obvious) Fate/Zero has a theme. And while telling you what exactly it is might be something of a spoiler for a few of you especially clever people I can tell you that pretty much every scene where the show seems to go off on a wonderful tangent for awhile is actually really important somehow, either in how the immediate plot will progress or by contributing to that theme I mentioned earlier. Two of my most favorite scenes in the show are great examples of this. The first is the interactions between the previously mentioned King of Heroes, a self-absorbed and ridiuclously powerful servant based on the history and legend of a guy called Gilgamesh, and a devout priest affiliated with the branch of the Catholic church that oversees the the Grail War as a neutral third party named Kotomone Kirei. Kirei takes the sin part of Catholicism pretty seriously and, being an aimless but dedicated fellow, assumed a supportive role for another master after he is chosen by the Grail to take part in the war. Besides being a terrible bore and unquestionably loyal to his betters, Kirei claims to be devoid of any personal interests whatsoever. Pleasure, he says, is a sin, and thus he has no use for it. Gilgamesh, a being who happily wallows in his pursuit of earthly pleasures and things of interest, finds Kirei fascinating and, over the course of a few scenes, relentlessly questions and challenges Kirei's beliefs. This begins as something of a side story, a bit of character development for a guy who seriously needs it, but the end result of their conversations completely changes the course of the war. This scene also happens to fuel vast yaoi fanfiction circles to this day. The second is a longer and wordier scene that fans of Ghost in the Shell would feel right at home in. It turns out that 3 of the servants summoned to the war claim to be kings, Saber, Rider, and Archer (Gilgamesh). So, to establish which king is the highest ranking one, they hold a banquet and talk about their accomplishments, their guiding principles, and what they hope to achieve if they win the Grail. Over the course of this scene Saber, one of the central figures in the show, has her central philosophy not only questioned but almost completely destroyed. Again, this seems more like character development for Saber more than anything and, while interesting and incredibly challenging to her, seems disconnected to the central theme. But her beliefs, even her very presence in the War, is paramount when it's time to wrap everything up at the show's end. It's not immediately obvious but this show does have a main character, and everything contained within its story serves as a means to challenge him as it comes to a close. The reason behind Kirei's lack of interest in seeking pleasure actually serves to tell something about the main character's goals and intentions, Saber's lofty and unattainable ideals speak volumes of the main character's motivation and where he'll end up, his personal history and family life illustrate his priorities and why they're kind of ****ed up; everything is centered around his personal philosophies, and it's his philosophies that give the show its central theme: what will you sacrifice to save others? 3) The End Makes Sense (Also: It Has An End To Begin With) Anime has a long and sordid history with endings. They tend to either take a completely different direction from a show's opening premise and end up making no sense at all (Evangelion) or they're rushed and filled with loose ends because no one on the team actually thought that far ahead (Xam'd... and Evangelion). It's usually somewhere toward the end the writers realize they haven't wrapped everything up or have lost sight of their original goal and just don't know what to do, sometimes because they were following source material that hasn't resolved itself either (Soul Eater, the original Full Metal Alchemist Series). But Fate/Zero is almost completely air tight, even though it's technically a prequel (one of the most difficult stories to write), and actually outshines the series he precludes in pretty much every way. Since this article doesn't deal with spoilers I can't tell you exactly what happens. But when it does it becomes clear that everything, from the characters to the plot twists to the very reason that these characters were brought together in the first place, was cleverly chosen to serve the story and the theme. I feel pretty confident in saying that there's no way you can guess how it will end yet it doesn't feel forced or out of place at all. It's consistent with the world, with the abilities of the people and entities within that world, and leads up perfectly to the lackluster series that technically follows it. Everything just clicks and comes together. It's a rare thing, especially in this medium, and more people should experience it. This point alone would put Fate/Zero about most other shows exactly because good endings in anime are so very rare. But this thing is the complete package, especially if you're looking for something a little more cerebral and deliberate than people banging their heads against a wall until it finally works somehow (which pretty much describes most shounen and even a lot of seinen anime out there). - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - I could go on and on about why this show is amazing, from the great use of imagery and foreshadowing to the clever cinematography and careful dialogue, but these are the major points I want to make -- these are the reasons why Fate/Zero is better than just about any other show you can come up with. 

 tl;dr 1. Gilgamesh 2. Alexander 3. Gilles de Rais I liked that you specifically mentioned my two favorite parts of the series: the conversations between Gilgamesh and Kirei as well as the kings' meeting. Those scenes are probably the best examples of the series' excellent writing. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 I'm biased in favor of GITS: SAC . Probably in two weeks time I could​ agree with you. You'll hear from me then.

 I don't see your Fate series beating my Favourite Animu, KT! Steins;gate is a masterpiece! No, but seriously I haven't seen Fate Zero yet so I can't really judge lol. I'll get on watching it soon enough. Nice review!

 Meh I'm sticking with sailor moon. Besides i haven't seen fate/zero either

 I watched the first hour-long episode to this series, and I was pretty impressed, though all the comments mentioned that viewers should watch the first series, Fate/Stay Night, first. Since I haven't finished Fate/Stay Night, I haven't picked this series back up. Anyway, I don't think this series can top Puella Magi Madoka Magica for me. Or FMA: Brotherhood. Ed's just too cute.

I'm not sure that I agree that Fate/Stay Night is required viewing to enjoy Fate/Zero. You'll get some additional context for the conclusion maybe, but everything in Fate/Zero stands on its own. Interestingly, you've mentioned two of the very few series that I would consider to be on Fate/Zero's level (Madoka actually has the same writer as Fate/Zero so you probably a have a good idea of what to expect). 

 I hope that it's as good as it's made out to be; I have both sets on order and I can't wait to watch them, but this here has me concerned; http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/revi...-ray-box-set-1 I want to disagree with this review, but I haven't watched the anime yet, but it looks like there are some angry fans in the forum. Just how it is, reviewers aren't always kind to our favorite shows, just how it goes. 
 
 Implying cute girls doing cute things isn't better than darkNedgy Fate/Zero. Actually, I liked Fate/Zero. I enjoy the F/Z fights, Saber getting told and the back story of Kiritsugu. The pacing of F/Z is a lot better than FSN anime adaptation. FSN was bad overall. 
 This anime owns for sure. But better than FMA:B? Hahaha, nah. Also, I kinda agree with the poster who said you need to know about "FSN". I don't necessarily think you need to watch the whole series or get the VN, but reading about what it is and understanding the universe provides GREAT context for this series. I know watching it I often wiki'd stuff about FSN and wanted to know more about the context of the heroes and how things actually work which is never really explained they just kinda throw you into it. But after reading about FSN I really enjoyed this series more. I give this series 8/10 maybe a strong 9, it's definitely good and I would definitely recommend it if you are into anime. Oh and the animation is ****in beautiful. Sick studio.

 Eh, seeing or reading F/SN may inform you a bit about some characters, what they do or will do, and certain events, but it's definitely not a prerequisite for watching F/Z. I only watched at most half of F/SN before I lost interest and dropped it, and I barely scratched the surface of the VN, and based on what I saw I know that none of it was needed to help understand F/Z. There was nothing in F/SN that I failed to understand because I didn't watch all of F/SN, nor was there anything that I wouldn't understand had I not watched any of F/SN. It'll help you recognize some characters, and F/Z will further explain a few things from F/SN, sure, but that's just in the nature of prequels. F/Z stands pretty solidly on its own, and F/SN is far from required to understand much. It wouldn't hurt, either, and there would be obvious advantages, but yeah, it's not necessary.

 Congratulations you just described Stiens;Gate, litereally to a tee. only real difference is the fewer number of characters 
 That reviewer needs to appreciate build up and pay off. He sounds like a Call of Duty player playing Bioshock: Infinite and wondering when all that silly talking is over so he can murder some pixels.

I wouldnt worry about him, or any other reviewer, or any other person for that matter if they say something negative about an anime you like; you like this series, you got a lot out of it, you appreciate it, thats all that matters. Ive pretty much realized its not worth my time to worry about other people speaking negatively about the shows I like, and since I like such a wide range of series; there is always a favorite show of mine getting dragged through the mud regardless of the type of series it is. No use getting butt hurt over it, besides; I like your assessment of Fate/Zero better, it assures me that I made the right decision to order it (along with some other shows), and, to be frank; its vastly better written than that review. Which reminds me; PSYCHO-PASS, which was written by the same guy is up for pre-order which I created an order for along with Evangelion 3.33 and some other shows. As far as ANN is concerned, well, theyre not in my good books, I can say that much, but thats a talk for another time. Peace out, see you round. 
 
 I actually prefer Eureka Seven as a complete and much better story. I loved the character depth and variety, the story, and the animation itself. The situation between the Coralians and the humans was done perfectly with a lot of twists and turns as well (especially when you find out the history of the planet) and the characters depth and development is top notch. They even gave you 50 complete episodes (hopefully people realize the meaning behind the name of each episode; and yes, even the titles of the episodes played a part in the anime) instead of a bastardized 12 or 13 episodes which allowed for the characters to grow and evolve with the progression of the story. Even the storyline itself was quite unique. and finally how many anime titles can fit into the slice of life, mecha, supernatural, romance, comedy, coming of age, adventure categories all at the same time lol. also I loved Code Geass and Yu Yu Hakusho much beter than Fate/Stay. Sorry

Oh and the animation is ****in beautiful. Sick studio. UFO Table knows how to use a big budgets, that's for sure. Originally Posted by Eamonisgod Congratulations you just described Stiens;Gate, litereally to a tee. only real difference is the fewer number of characters Thank you? I've not yet seen Steins;Gate, truthfully. I might pick it up sometime down the line. Originally Posted by legatoVIII I actually prefer Eureka Seven as a complete and much better story. I loved the character depth and variety, the story, and the animation itself. I could write an article about E7 as well, though I have some reservations about the ending and everything that followed the original series. It's easily one of studio BONES' best titles to date and a great watch/study. They even gave you 50 complete episodes (hopefully people realize the meaning behind the name of each episode; and yes, even the titles of the episodes played a part in the anime) instead of a bastardized 12 or 13 episodes which allowed for the characters to grow and evolve with the progression of the story. I take issue with this point. More episodes does not necessarily lead to better character growth and 12 or 13 episodes is not necessarily worse than 50. You mentioned Code Geass, a show that actually suffered immensely during its second season precisely because it went on too long. Death Note had the same problem, as did countless other shows. But a comparatively shorter show like Bacanno! or Madoka is exactly as long as it needs to be without overstaying its welcome. In fact, sheer length is an enormous problem with Naruto and Bleach, two shows that should have ended ages ago but are spinning their wheels in order to continue raking in easy cash. If Fate/Zero went on any longer than it did it would be drawn out and would suffer. Its greatest asset is its tight plot that does what it needs to and nothing more. Even E7 has trouble in this regard. A huge chunk of episode 4 is a complete waste of time, for example, and adds nothing to the plot or characters. I love E7, but it's got problems that Fate/Zero doesn't (or has much, much less of). 

 Unfortunately the shortness of the anime this time hurt Fate/Stay more than a long E7 anime. It didnt allow for the audience to really connect to all of the characters well enough before they fought. E7 was able to give you enough backstory while keeping the present moving as well. I felt as though it was mind candy trying to figure out the big picture of the anime before it was revealed. also I completely removed AO from the conversation. It was good near the end but...not good enough. I think of AO as a spin off more than a continuation. Fate/Stay makes my top ten but not my top five. For short anime I loved Gods Memo Pad. I hope for a second season. 
 I suppose the only question I have for you there is, What exactly was missing from the character development in F/Z that could have been alleviated by making the series longer? Which characters did you have trouble connecting with? 

 Do a review on Steins;gate! watch the show first of course! I think you will like it!

 ^ i agree do a steins;gate review plus youll appreciate the show 
 Originally Posted by KT Samurai I suppose the only question I have for you there is, What exactly was missing from the character development in F/Z that could have been alleviated by making the series longer? Which characters did you have trouble connecting with? Actually since you're a massive (obviously) fan of the series maybe you can get an opinion on this. I watched Fate/Zero as it was coming out. But the thing is I actually never watched Stay/night. I know the general plot and such only now after watching reviews for the show. At the time after watching Fate/Zero I thought it was one of the greatest shows ever, and was definitely my favourite anime for quite some time. But I'm usually one that changed my opinion with time, and after watching more shows it's probably around number #5 for me at the moment, behind Fullmetal Alchemist, Baccano, Cowboy Bebop and Steins;Gate. (In no particular order) Anyway I've sidetracked a little, here's my question. do you think I benefited from not watching Stay/Night, since I heard one of the major complaints was that stay/Night watchers already knew the ending and the majority of twists (Don't quote me on that I'm ignorant of seeing Stay/Night). Also I heard that a lot of people got a little confused with the plot line, I didn't really have this problem and had no real problem following the story. As a side note, just thinking about it... I can't believe I still haven't seen Stay/Night considering how much I loved Zero. 
 At #24 now, and while I am enjoying it, it really isn't making a lasting impression. Besides they just killed my fav char. Bastards.

(In no particular order) Those are all respectable choices as far as I'm concerned. Bacanno! especially since it doesn't just do established things well it does its own thing and brags about it all along. I adore Bacanno!. Anyway I've sidetracked a little, here's my question. do you think I benefited from not watching Stay/Night, since I heard one of the major complaints was that stay/Night watchers already knew the ending and the majority of twists (Don't quote me on that I'm ignorant of seeing Stay/Night). Also I heard that a lot of people got a little confused with the plot line, I didn't really have this problem and had no real problem following the story. If you know what goes down in Fate/Stay you'll know quite a bit going in to Fate/Zero. But I have to say that I, as someone who did watch Fate/Stay first, was thrown for a loop on at least a couple of things. For example, the very fact that there is a Grail war after F/Z should clue you in on a couple things like what likely happened to most of the servants and masters who didn't win. But even then there's some great twists that I didn't see coming and that I loved. Knowing what happened in Fate/Stay will give away a certain part of the ending but not the most important part, i.e. what exactly happens to the main character and why he makes the decisions he makes afterward. As a side note, just thinking about it... I can't believe I still haven't seen Stay/Night considering how much I loved Zero. Fate/Stay isn't as good, unfortunately. I wouldn't call it bad or anything but it's tonally confused in some areas and the main character can grate on your nerves a little. Originally Posted by Regnent At #24 now, and while I am enjoying it, it really isn't making a lasting impression. Besides they just killed my fav char. Bastards. Well, I'm happy that you enjoyed it at least. And yeah, that's bound the happen unfortunately.

You can watch the new FSN by ufotable when it airs. http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news...n-teaser-video Possibly a better choice than the DEEN version. 
 Yeah, I just found out about the remake last night. Super stoked! DEEN's version is pretty lacking, which is a shame since I do love Shirou.
