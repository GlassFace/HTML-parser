 [Mysterious Girlfriend X] Season 2???
 I just finished watching this series about a month ago on Anime Network on demand, so I'm not sure about season 2 either, these postings are from 2 years ago? Anyway, the manga has plenty of chapters to read if you like reading manga online. Also, the 2nd anime I've seen with a crazy scissors wielding girl, the first one was Dog & Scissors of course.
