 Attack on Titan Tribute Game
 The other day i found this video  Spoiler http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooTgW...9CPaGbi0AXDiWn An AoT game! It looked really fun.If you have not play this i recommend it, its a free Unity game. It takes some getting use to. Sadly i do not have many friends that like Titan (or anime for that matter) to have LAN adventures but hopefully we will get a server up to play this online with others. I invite others join if it works, for Humanity! Link to game  Spoiler http://fenglee.com/game/aog/ By the way i realize this game is not new but i did not find a thread for it here.
