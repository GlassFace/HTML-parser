[General Discussion] How do I get a girlfriend?
 This is my OkCupid profile. [NOPE REMOVED] How do I find a girlfriend with this OkCupid profile? Or should I be looking for a girl friend IRL and not on the Internet?

 You should look for a girl IRL its better because you can see what her pros and cons are rather then the internet only relying on what she tells you and plus what if your girlfriend is states across from you be surprised if already is either ugly or she is using you or you never know males like to act as females you never know buddy so its better in IRL. 

 IRL is better. But meeting up with people from the internet is useful. Just don't get caught up in long distance crap. Calm in everything. Smile. She'll dig you. Entirely ground yourself. Be a boss. Be yourself. Some girl will have chemistry with you. Don't rush it, find the right person for you. Bad website to ask this question anyway, but luckily for you, I'm here to give you this advice, follow it. Don't rush it, just do your best and work at it. Stop wanting to do it, and go do it. Again, don't rush it. Part of being more socially adept is working on yourself. Don't get discouraged. Keep moving forward. Good luck.

 Spend your entire life gathering together wealth and material goods. When you die, you might be considered worthy of some companionship. But that could backfire as well. I do not know. For every person it is different. Find your own style and stick with it if it proves to have any success. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OPossum | Homestuck
 Kinda have a hard time taking this seriously... You for real? Not hating or anything... Be social, don't force anything (like humor), don't be awkward, and never wait for somebody to talk to you first.

 It's kind of ironic to be asking for relationship advice on anime-forums. Some people here probably still sleep while hugging Hatsune Miku pillow.

If I take your advice to heart do you think I too can start private messaging girls on Internet forums with things like this? http://vocaroo.com/i/s1TR4YMhO75z Everyone, this is why we don't ask people on the Internet for relationship advice.

I imagine everybody who has actually had sex would unanimously agree that any woman who listens to that would fail to get moist for at least three months after.

You trying to imagine if I would make your vagina wet(lol @ "moist"l) if you had one... Dude, seriously, this thing you have for me really needs to quit. Keep your feelings to yourself. I don't even like you as a friend.
