[General Discussion] What's your motto?
 I've grown attached to the phrase "Fail Faster," as it helps me not over think things. It basically means that no idea is inherently perfect and needs to be molded through trail and error, so the faster you fail the faster you realize where you went wrong. Plus my uni work is pretty iterative so "fail faster" naturally applies to it.
