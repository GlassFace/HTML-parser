 Well I tried. I mentioned this before, but the lack of players really does kill an Rp, even before the thing is able to take off.

 The RP's quite okay at the moment. The only thing that is worrying is the participation.

 Nah, they haven't ruined it. Some dramatic people did cause some BS, but you kinda have to just leave it behind and move on. I think the important thing to remember is that some of the new kids might be trying their hand at this for the first time, and they need a nudge in the right direction. For instance, they should be trying to improve on their writing skills in order to get better at RPing, meaning that they need to maybe put a little more depth into their posts. Rather than throw the towel in on them, advise them. Sometimes a friendly word of advice goes a long way, especially when it comes to people writing one liners that don't really add much atmosphere to what their characters are doing. Forcing themselves to write paragraphs of at least 6 lines is a good start. Another thing that greatly helps in writing any kind of story, RP or not, is to read a lot of books yourself. Say if you're into fantasy RP, then of course you'll enjoy fantasy books. It will actually help with your ideas and ability to set a scene. These things are simple advice for newbies that the rest of you already know. They have to start somewhere. =)

 Originally Posted by Kaoru Asuna ​Yeah, at least two people have quit the Code:RED RP, and it hasn't een been open very long. It was a bit of a disaster for me due to my personal preferences. I don't want to say it sucked, because it wasn't awful or unenjoyable at parts, but I did not enjoy the behavior and gameplay of my fellow players and the overall performance of the GM. That's how I justify my resignation...and that feels damn good to get that out of my mouth. I didn't like Code: RED and I was expecting more of Simplicity Project when I entered. Those also feel good to confess. EY YO PEOPLE Be honest, it feels good. I certainly don't want to cause grudges or burn bridges with the friendly, intelligent people in this forum and I expect you all not to either. So, I hope those who enjoy this Code: RED RP can tolerate my criticism towards it. As for the comment on "kids ruining this forum" well, I'm a youngster but that certainly doesn't mean I'll stay as one. Same goes for the other folks like me. As ShanApp advised, advice only helps us move up. Personally I've been RP'ing for a while and am freakin' starving for a good one to dive into. So...PLEASE MAKE SOME THREADS 
 I can't help but infer your future resignation from Simplicity Project, Shmuser Name.

 I don't think the Kids ruined the RP section as I think it was more other problems with adults that caused the issues. With that said I have noticed the replies are generally short, and by short I mean REALLY short. A line or two is not really worth calling an RP post. There should be at least some effort put into it so that you can build up several paragraphs and create a story. Describe what the person is doing, where they are looking, what their tone of voice is. Originally Posted by Example of what I see in some RPs now: "Where do you suppose we should go?" Originally Posted by Example of how it can be improved: The hunter laid his palm on the ground and closed his eyes, taking in all the sounds and noises from the ever so quiet wildlife. He breathed slowly and rubbed the ground with a gentle touch. "Where do you suppose we should go?" the young apprentice whispered with a sense of curiosity. "Through the forest," He replied in a rustic voice, "Our prey is using it to try and cover his path." He said this knowing that it would be much easier for him as he knew exactly how to read the evidence that many people left while fleeing through thick scrub. Broken branches, torn clothing, even the odd footprint in mud was enough to lead them on their chase. See the difference? Now imagine how easier it will be to build a story and to participate as apposed to the first example which is little more than a lazy man's effort at role playing. Actually, really good name for it is a "quote war" since it hasn't expanded into what roleplaying really is about.

Nuttzy has the right idea for what I wish the RP's can be in the present. However the only two which are currently going on are the Code: Red one and Simplicity Project. The latter has a lot of potential as we're just cranking it up, and I haven't checked the former out after I resigned. You know what would make my day? Some apps for my own RP #shameless #flawless 
 Simplicity project has a good story and is well organized, reminds me a bit of Liar Game. It just needs more engagement. I thought about joining Code: Red, but I haven't had the time to read the IC thread and some of the character profiles seemed to have the potential to get OP very quickly. Anyhow, I find that the best way to make an RP more interesting, if its not your own nor to your liking, is to make actual suggestions to the creators; what can be improved? what can make this a really good story and fun? etc. Or, as said, even just writing more depth into your character/posts to help drive the story and character interactions. 

 I may be new around here, but I've also got something pretty unusual by RP standards... I'm looking for fans of the Magical Girl genre, as I'm doing something which incorporates elements of that specific type. I was wondering if I could get a fan to hopefully participate; in fact, it's how I was looking for stuff here in the first place. If anyone is interested in participating with what I have in mind, feel free to leave a message. =P

If anyone is interested in participating with what I have in mind, feel free to leave a message. =P I've never done any writing except for a James Bond rp on an old forum a long time ago. I also did a personal extension of somebodies fantasy writing that I kept to myself (very short add on that was to satisfy my need for a continuation of the story). That being said I might be interested in helping you out somehow. I'm not a writer by any means so don't expect much. But if you want story ideas or just somebody to bounce ideas off of I could help...... Though my participation may be sporadic.

No, not to advance the plot in particular, but to interact with one and another, work with each other. In this case, Simplicity Project is the best. You can take this Rp to practice yourself with others, to work things out. This is something I didn't really see for the time I was around, except on a few occasion. Which is you say ? Making friendly links with other role players. We aren't an extremely big community, but having a rival or anyone you can always enjoy having fun in rp's with is FANTASTIC. Over the what, three years I've been here ? I never truly see any of this. I always had this little rival thing with Dust, most of the time it was not even planned to be honest. But it made everything so fun and enjoyable because we knew that no matter what, we'd always end up on the same side. Having a love and hate relation with our characters, but it made it hilarious at points, enjoyable. I just think we should all make ourselves small bounds to each others. Pair each other. ''Wink wink nudge nudge. '' 
A calm . mind is the key to success.
 Was considering setting something up here. However, I would like to ask - do you believe that forum or chat RP is better? I have personally gone by chat RP, however I have never done forum RP in my years of experience. What would you lot say? 
I am sorry...
 Well Chiisana Akuma... I personally ship Randoms and Yoda in a (possibly) homoerotic relationship with each other, one is a bit serious and intellectually sound while the other is smart and charming, but also lively in a youthful type of way. loljk seriously I was doubting posting this but I was like **** it, I can always delete/edit it later if a mod hasn't deemed it inappropriate.

''Wink wink nudge nudge. '' Yes, this! In my past RP experiences, everyone pitched in ideas and character interactions were a huge factor. Overtime, we all became familiar with our character types and such, so things like rivalries, funny events/running gags, and alliances became a part of the flow. It was pretty awesome. I would really like to see that here D: Simplicity Project does have a lot of potential for this. *wink wink cough nudge wink* If I get some downtime this week, I might try to set up an RP as well. 

 A question: I'm not interested in having a group RP via thread. I don't enjoy having to reply via a forum to a constantly changing thread. I'd rather like, however, a 1 on 1 RP involving an AU Gunslinger Girl plot with OCs. (I'd like to RP a handler.) I don't see many "advertisements" for that here. (At all.) So how do I post such a thing?

So how do I post such a thing? You could try posting your plot in the section with your limitation to an RP between yourself and one other person. At that point it could go to IC in a PM thread. But I don't know how anyone in that section would appreciate a two person IC popping up. 
 HONK :O) 
 2 person IC is fine imo, so long as the posting is of a certain length and I think from looking at the OOC, this it what teezoen wants. You know how people can think along the lines of "someone else did it, now I'll start one and spam." I would probably close a thread if it was 1v1 one liners or something.

 One liners are not an issue. I've been used to para for years now. I can't write 3 page essays per post like some people can, but then, I have two jobs, so I have an excuse at the very least. 
 One liners defeat the purpose of thread RP all together. If you're gonna one-line it, just hop over to IM RP or something. Also whoo, first post after being dead for like, idk, half a year maybe?
