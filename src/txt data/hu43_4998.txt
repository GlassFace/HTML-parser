[Site] What Youtube channels do you watch?
 There's a thread on Youtube entering it's........10th? year, so that got me thinking: Youtube has millions of channels, so I'm interested in what channels do you watch/are subbed to? With this question, It'll help me discover new channels Me Personally: Dookieshed- Poketuber JWittz- Poketuber Game Theory- Crazy Theories about different games (For example, a theory that Mario is Anti-social and one that Link is Dead in Majora's Mask) He dives deep, doing pixel measurements and even physics formulas Watchmojo- Top 10s on just about everything CinemaSins- Pointing out the bullcrap in movies for comedy. Some of it is made up, while some of it is legit Music Video Sins- Same as CinemaSins, but targeting Music Videos (Like Party in the USA) There are probably more, but that's all I can name off the top of my head
