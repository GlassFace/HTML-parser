 Osu! - Page 5
 Dude it is blocked. Copyright is a ***** eh? Seems weird if the music was allowed on osu it should be allowed on youtube. Try adding 'Lets Play' to the start of the name and make sure you put the song and artist in the description. I got this one, did not beat it on hard but i only tried it once so i shall try again now.

 Finally gave this game a shot, but jesus it could use a better management system for uploaded tracks and removing duplicate entries. 

 If you are seeing multiples of the same song, they will be different beatmaps. Some will be a long or short version, some will be with or without video. For some the only difference other than the beatmap is they use a different image as the background, but it is still okay. I would not want 20 beatmaps for one song all under the same header. I have not tried the upload system yet but i do not have particularly high expectations considering the apparent frailty of the server hosting the osu site. First time you played this game?

 Yeah first time I tried Osu. It's fun, I just wish it was easier to search for songs; I get that different uploaders and versions are going to happen, but having pages of results for the same song when half of them lead to dead ends that the user apparently deleted two years ago is sorta silly. Just seems like they need to clean their database up and overhaul it to be more user-friendly, given the enormous popularity. 

 Yeah, would make sense. I wont now but if you want tomorrow i can link some good beatmaps or ones i started out with? dunno which styles you would prefer but i can categorize my list O:

 Sure! Whatevers fine, mostly just been trying out songs I like. Open to suggestions though! 

 http://osu.ppy.sh/s/17624 That was my favourite when I was starting out (If you like vocaloids) I still love it today.

If you donate to osu which is like 4$ you get osu premium and a more advanced downloader.

 I made some annoying mistakes but i am still chuffed to beat another insane beatmap. @Tak i did not know you could give them money, but i did now and i like the result! It lost a bit of quality being recorded at 1/4 frame rate, but i recorded in 1080

F&#k!!!!!!, my limit is a 4 star song, 4 1/2 with lots of mistakes Yeah those beatmaps are usually good! When i started i could manage a 4 star. Now i can do some 5star but the gap from 4 1/2 to 5 star (on most beatmaps) is crazy. I think generally ones marked as 'Another' difficulty or something all in caps like 'SOLO' or 'CRAZY' are the hardest. Hyper are probably the easiest 5 star level because they are really fast but have simple patterns. (Usually that is, they are all different)

 i also like the music now, never really actually listened to vocaloids until now isn't anything labled above hard (insane, crazy..ect) only really possible with a touchpad, not sure ill ever move my mouse that fast

 My mouse is almost 1:1 precision, if i had a touch pad i would need it to be the size of the screen. And even then, it would be hard to know where on the screen you are about to poke. A touch screen would be better, but it would not last long against osu! i dont think. Turn your system and game sensitivity to make, set cursor to unlimited frame. Also if you didnt know, you can press z and/or x instead of clicking. It is a lot easier, and i think you cannot do insane ones by clicking the mouse.

 WHY DID THAT HELP!!! I does not make sense to me but using Z for my click made it much easier! It feels odd but i think ill be a lot better soon. Thanks

 Assuming it was the same reason as me, with keys you can keep moving your mouse at the same speed but with clicking you will slow down or speed up your movement as you click, making you miss more circles.

 I watched the china vs switzerland (was that it?) match, never realized how boring it can be to watch other people play this realtime.

 Does anyone play OSU Mania? I prefer it to OSU Standard at the moment. Here's a video of me playing. I really failed though, this song is pretty difficult.
