 [HELP] Can't post/Can't post outside this section/Didn't get an activation email
 A few accounts seem to have this issue from time to time. Recheck your email inbox for an activation email from the forum, also check your spam as it can sometimes get filtered. If there is no email, and you still cannot post here in Introductions, please send a PM to Shian Kiri or any available moderator saying that you are unable to post. It may take 24 hours to get your account activated as an admin needs to put you in the correct usergroup. UPDATE: Hi guys, After making a post in introductions, you must wait for the site to update in order to post on the rest of the forums. The site updates accounts automatically every hour, so while it could be 5 minutes, others could be waiting longer. The maximum time you could be waiting to post in other forums after making an intro is 1 hour. As usual, if it doesn't let you post outside introductions after an hour, PM a member of staff. =)
