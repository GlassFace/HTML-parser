 Fantasy Books
 It's a new year and January is going to be a pretty good month for fantasy! First on the list we have Firefight which came out yesterday. This is a sequel to Steelheart from The Reckoners, a Sanderson novel about a world where a small minority of the population suddenly developed superhuman powers, which also induce psychosis. It's a pretty young adult kind of prose, but certainly enjoyable. I'm 40% of the way in and while not as good as the first, it's still been a nice read. On the 11th the second installment of Chronicle of the Unhewn Throne is going to be released. The first book was absolutely amazing and I can't wait for the new one. Unfortunately we won't see Doors of Stone this year. Patrick Rothfuss apparently won't get off his lazy ass to finish the goddamn trilogy yet so at this point he's gone full George RR Martin.
