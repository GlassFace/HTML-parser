[Anime] What do you think of harem anime?
 I agree that there are too many harem shows and most are pretty bad. The worst for me are ones that don't look like harem for the first season, then suddenly every single female falls in love with the MC for unexplainable reasons in the second season. Usually this main character is super timid/boring and the only thing going for him is he's a nice guy. I think the only 2 I have watched and actually liked are War on Geminar and Highschool DXD, both have a more interesting/assertive MC than most harem shows. The idea of a 3 way war from DXD is great, not that they have done too much with it, but for the most part it's boobs, comedy, boobs. The fact that the MC admits to wanting to become the "harem king" and that most of the girls are ok with it adds to the comedy for me, but I watch these when I'm in the mood for mindless enjoyment, not a tightly focused character driven story.
