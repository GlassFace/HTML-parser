 Hacking- What Do You Think, A4? - Page 2
 Is it right or wrong? Is it ethical? Where do you draw the line that divides innocent research from wrong doing? I'd like to hear what your opinions are, A4. What do you consider "hacking" and what is your definition of a hacker? Do you see it as a display of brilliance or do you see it as a crime regardless of its nature? 
 It was only a matter of time... Now I am one with the night and stars again... Thank you, Rhyme's Law, for your signature art work.
