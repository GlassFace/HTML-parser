[General Discussion] The super bowl 49 thread
 Welp, the coaching call messed up Seattle. I am ok with the Pats (except cheating out the Ravens), but Seattle messed up. Did they forget that Lynch is the best running-back? All else fails just run it Wilson. Welp, now Lynch has a reason to avoid the media and just sit back and eat skittles.
