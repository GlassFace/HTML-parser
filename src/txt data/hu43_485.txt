 Ranma 1/2 らんま½
 "Ranma 1/2. It's a fantasy, a comedy, a martial-arts and romantic mixture. If you like a little fun and action, I'd give it a try." I recently borrowed Ranma 1/2 from the library as I was keen to watch something 'a little different'. Most anime/manga seems a 'little different' to me, although I think Ranma 1/2 is pretty original. Ranma 1/2 has a sex-changing main character who willfully changes into a girl to advance his goals. The series also contains a few supporting characters whose eccentric personalities drive most of the stories and make them hard to forget. I hadn't read the original manga, only one of the two anime series. Produced by 'Kitty Films', Ranma 1/2 and Ranma 1/2 Nettōhen originally broadcasted on Fuji Television between 1989-1992. You can tell the anime is a little dated, the animation and colours are a little 'washed'... but it just adds to the 'unusual' feeling. I really enjoyed watching this anime series and would recommend it to anyone who likes a little comedy and action. Overall, I'd score it 7.5/10. If anyone knows a series similar to Ranma 1/2 please post any suggestions below; all your input will be appreciated. - Ohaius
