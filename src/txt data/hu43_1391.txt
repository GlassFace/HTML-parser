 Favorite Anime Girl
 So many to choose from... I guess my all time favorite would be Sango from Inuyasha. Hence, my username, lol. I love her strength and her passion to do what she needs to get revenge for her family. Also, her keeping Miroku in line made me chuckle a lot. =P An honorable mention would be Cagalli from Gundam SEED. Because she's a princess that rather not be one and wants to kick butt. =) 
 Banner was not made by me. ----------------------------------------- Current Sig & Avi: Asuran & Cagalli from GS/GSD Current Manga: Attack on Titan & Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi Current Anime: Tokyo Ghoul & Aldnoah.Zero Current Music: SHINee, シド, & Empire Cast
