 I would really love a signature.
 ♥Hi. I would like to ask you to make a Signiture for me please♥ Here the picture I'd like you to use. I don't want anything fancy, I'd just like the words 'I can't protect you without holding a sword,' across the top in dark blue (it's okay if it covers the top of her head), and the words 'I can't embrace you while holding a sword.' in purple across the bottom. Thank you so much♥♥♥
