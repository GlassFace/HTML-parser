 The Big 3 Manga (Is is worth it?)

It surely is fun for me. The manga obviously lacks colours but, other than that, looks better. Oda puts an adequate amount of information and action into the chapters and they're fun reading, I'm also still watching the weekly anime episodes. By the way, episode 389 can't be Fishman Island, 389 would be around Sabaody Archipelago? Or did you mix up numbers?
