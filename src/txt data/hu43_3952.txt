[Manga] Similar Manga Suggestions?
 Recently, I just finished reading an amazing manga called, "I Am A Hero". The style of the manga was something that I really enjoyed, also the dark tone of the manga, and the realism that it had. Unfortunately, I'm already up to date with the manga, and I really hate waiting for new chapters to come out as it takes forever. I tried looking up some other manga similar to this one, but I had no luck. The suggestions were nothing like what I wanted to see in a manga. One, it'd be nice to see realistic drawings like this manga had. Also, I personally don't like romance stories and such. The reason I liked this certain manga was due to it's gore and such. I also really enjoyed it because it was able to show how a zombie apocalypse would be in our world as of now. It had up to date technology (kind of, at least there were touch phones and such) and it just felt really real. If anyone could suggest a couple of manga like this one, I'd really appreciate it, thanks!
