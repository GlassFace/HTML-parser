[General Discussion] What do you do during holiday breaks?
 So what do you do during holiday breaks? I generally just zone out. Ill do the family stuff of course but other than that I really dont travel. With the thanksgiving break next month im planning on playing a lot of assassins creed unity and halo master chief collection. I also want to work on my guitar playing. Im nearly ready to play Pride by U2 all the way through. Though not perfectly but you can recognize the riffs. Ill also do some mini anime marathoning. So do you travel? Just chill? Host parties?
