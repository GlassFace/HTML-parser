 [a certain scientific railgun] best episode and season 3?
 hey guys, as you can guess im asking which was your favorite episode and then if season might happen. I loved the first episode of railgun S -spoiler in coming- where Misaka railguns the helicopter, loved this because the team work between Kuroko and Misaka is funny as hell and then its just boss the way Misaka just annihilates the helicopter (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6f5NljlFDk) â€‹-spoiler complete- I really hope there is a season three as it one of my favorite anime and there are more thatn enough manga to go on. I really hope FUNimation makes another season!!! what do you think?
