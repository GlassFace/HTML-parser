[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Well my top 3 favorite songs of course. Those would be hysteria by nano, passion by Utada Hikaru and yes it's the kingdom hearts theme. My third would be I guess roller coaster by Luke Bryan I don't care for country but this song has a ton of re listen to value.
