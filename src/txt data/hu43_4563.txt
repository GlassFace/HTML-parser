[Anime] "Romance Anime"
 I have recently discovered the world of "romance" anime. Most of them are themed in high school, but I can't help it, I just can't get enough of them. I'm wondering if anyone has any more recommendations of these in particular and I was also wondering if there are any out there that are a little more mature? (Not themed in high school) A few of what I'm referring to: Blue Spring Ride❤❤❤ Kimi ni Todoke❤❤ My Little Monster❤❤ Kotoura-san❤ Wolf Girl & Black Prince❤❤❤ Clannad/Afterstory❤❤❤

 Why has no one mentioned Toradora or Golden Time?! 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils?

It's up to the poster to choose. Wondering Son and Otome Wa Baku are interesting crossdressing ones with romantic encounters/triangles. (both school ones).

 Inuyasha+Inuyasha the Final Act The Legend of Condor Hero -------------------------------------------- Those are the top two anime with the strongest romance aspects in the history of anime. After them, check these out Elemental Gelade(an insanely great romance aspect for a series so short, make sure to watch this dubbed. the voice actress for ren, is the only one who could pull this off in the entire industry, It's amazing how much emotion she can show, without saying much of anything) Spice and wolf(note: sadly the romance aspect is way underplayed in this, but still a very good anime) Zero no Tsukaima(technically It's a high school, but not really, and anyway it function more like a bording school. Think of it like the Hary Potter of the anime industry, but even better. Awesome romance aspect, but don't watch the dub, watch it sub only) Nana(this is great, until the ending, it has got to have the worst ending ever created, would/ve been better with no ending at all) Hanasakeru Seishounen(this is just pure great story telling, and although the romance aspect Isn't that strong, It's always preasant throughout the series) Akatsuki no Yona(It has been light on the romance aspect so far, but that's because Yona is dense as hell, but there is a insanely strong romance backdrop, so the romance aspect should go through the roof at some point) 
 [IMG][/IMG] It probally wouldn't be a good idea to get on Qiang Lei's bad side.
 It's tough to find not school themed anime. First a couple of impressive movies that blend sci-fi into the school genre 1. Voices from a Distant Star: This is about a girl and boy separated when one goes to fight in a space war. They send mail to each other and as the physical distance grows between them, the emails they send take longer and longer (This is on crunchy roll I think). 2. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time: This is about a high school girl who winds up finding a time jumping device one day, and uses it to try make her life better in small, unimpressive ways. And a couple of great series that are set in college. 1. Honey and Clover: About a bunch of art students in college. This one was on netflix a while back. Not sure if it's still there but worth checking out in this genre. It follows them graduating and going out into the working world. 2. Nodame cantabile: This one's about a couple of music students in college, one who wants to be a kindergarten teacher and another who wants to be a conductor. Pretty much traverses their relationship and careers. And although they don't really count as romance, they have great love stories in them 1. Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal - This is about a boy swordsman who joins the meiji revolution. A woman who's fiancee he kills attempts to kill him, but instead winds up living with him. This is a 4 part OVA that's a side story to a much longer anime on hulu called Rurouni Kenshin. It was also called Samurai X I think back when I bought the DVD. 2. Cowboy Bebop - Kind of a spoiler, a bounty hunter who used to be a gangster leaves the mob, and asks a woman to come with him.

 There is Ano Natsu de Natero (Waiting in the Summer). Thats a SciFi/School/Romance. Kamisama Kiss is a sort of supernatural romance. There is a romance aspect of Bakuman although it is mainly about two guys making Manga. Those are the main ones I know of that haven't been mentioned yet. 

 My top 3 1.Oran high school host club(highly recommend) 2.Toradora (all time great) 3.School Rumble (more comedic than romantic but it's hilarious) Wildcard: DBZ (it doesn't get any better than Vageta×Bulma) 

 Alright strap on your romance shoes here comes the romance train of love. Toradora (school setting, really freaking good) Golden Time (it's really just a "feel good" romance that's average in my opinion. Still worth watching) Inuyasha plus Inuyasha final act (it's just awesome. It's pretty old, but still worth watching) Angel Beats (sc-fi fantasy) Sword Art Online Love Hina plus all the Love Hina specials Zero no Tsukaima Lovely Complex Dusk maiden of Amnesia kaichou wa maid-sama (this one is perfect for you based on what you've watched) Same thing with "Say I love you" Say I love you and Kaichou wa maid-sama are probably the best for you

 Thank you so much everyone! I will check as many of these out as possible! I really didn't know there were so many different romancy types of anime out there! Amazing.

Amazing. You're quite welcome. I thought I'd be doing you a disservice if I did not mention 5cm per second. It's a 3 part series combined into a "movie". It's just over an hour or so it won't take a lot of time. It's a unique romance show that's worth watching. I don't really want to say too much. Don't want to spoil it for you and you should make up your own opinion of it after watching it.

 Angel Beats was not a romance anime.

 Yeah you can't really shoehorn a relationship into a show and call it a rommance. Doesn't work that way I'm afraid

 People praise SAO for its romance, when I really didn't see a lot of solid feeling or emotion in this ecchii harem drama. Um, it was one of the worst love-stories I ever watched - my opinion includes that of the events of the Aincrad arc. @Broda Angel Beats had a nice, pleasantly surprising relationship blossom through the series albeit subtly. It wasn't a centerpiece of the plot, as romance anime are categorized by. Would I call Star Wars a Romance because Han and Leia or Padme and Anakin fell in love with each other?

No it's not focused as a romance necessarily, but it's still a romance. Clannad for example has only Drama for about 18 of its 24 episodes (is it 24 or 26 lol). Clannad seriously has no romantic communication for about 75% of its episodes. It's either focused on separate people to develop characters, or it's focused on the relationships and problems of all the characters. Yet, people still say it's one of the best romances of all time. Even though it's a great show, you saying that Angel Beats isn't a romance would be saying that Clannad isn't a romance. Clannad focuses on drama while Angel Beats focuses more on action.
