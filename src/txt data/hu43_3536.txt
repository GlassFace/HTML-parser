[General Discussion] Which hair styles have you regretted wearing?
 So which hair styles have you regretted wearing? I've pretty much worn the same style for years. Just a simple part nothing fancy. But I did remember the spike I wore in middle school for a short while (late 80s early 90s). So are you haunted by the big hair of the 80s? Did you have a Mohawk?
