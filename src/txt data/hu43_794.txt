 My theory though.  Spoiler I don't think he is dead because he mentioned earlier in the episode that he never sucked anyones blood so thats why the Demons inside of him do not respect him. They later mention that the demons inside the little girl are killing her rapidly because she is not a vampire. So my theory is he somehow is alive but barely, they go on to defeat that old man and he sucks the girls blood making her a Vampire and extending her life span. 

 Whether or not he is dead, I will continue for Yukina-sensei. This just gives her more motivation.

 Maybe he needs to be resurrected or something XD

 I saw the frist episode of this series looks very good so far

 Just watched ep.4, still great  Spoiler Was really expected it to pick up where it left off last episode with his head in her arms, but I liked the way they went about it. Really liking their relationship, though I'm kinda worried about the whole she was sent there to be his lover thing that crow said. Could possible tear them apart for alittle bit or atleast but some distance between them which would be really sad, but I think the way the characters are it'll be more of a strengthening of their relationship when they find out 
 That moment you realize that your job will never be completed...  Spoiler And by the way... I'm not naming names, but you know who you are... -_-

 There you go, everything was daijoubu. XD He's an immortal vampire after all. It wouldn't be called Strike the Blood without him. "Hmmm, You hurt her, she bled, and she had to get checked, and it was a safe day, so the results were negative?" Thank god it was negative XD

 I wasn't a fan of "Oh are you awake yet?" "Oh I died didn't I." But they made up for it with an awesome fight, and the soundtrack...DAMN THE SOUNDTRACK so good. The ending was pretty funny with the checking of the blood haha 

 I loved that their adversary turned out to be a brave and noble hero...

 Ned Hopefully you saw the most recent episode. I know you are not missing out seeing Yukina in a dress XD

 INTENSE!!! Loving this show. 

 This episode had very well-paced action!

 who's your god now?! huh? I'm still going for Kujou x Asagi. NOT Himeragi.

 I'd have to see what kind of pantsu Asagi wears before I could choose between the two. It wouldn't be fair otherwise, since I've only seen Himeragi's pantsu. :3
