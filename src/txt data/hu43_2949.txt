[Fantasy] Sora no Method (Celestial Method)
 Crunchyroll’s stable of shows for the fall season grows once again as the service will be adding Sora no Method this season under the localized name of Celestial Method. The show is set to stream on Sunday’s starting on October 5th, at 10:30 AM Eastern Time. Premium members will get first dibs for a week and then free members can check it out. The show has a decent bit of availability about it as it’s open to audiences in the USA, Canada, UK, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and Turkey. The series stars Natsukawa Shiina as Nonoka Komiya, Inori Minase as Noel, Haruka Yoshimura as Shiiba Koharu, Kaito Ishikawa as Souta Mizusaka and Aki Toyosaki as Yuzuki Mizusaka. Celestial Method is directed by Masayuki Sakoi, who worked on the Needless series as director as well as Princess Resurrection and several other shows over the years, going back to Strawberry Panic. The show has an original concept and script by Naoki Hisaya, who worked on the two Kanon releases as well as the original creator for Sola, which gives a few clues as to what kind of show this will be like. Character designs will be handled by QP:flapper while the adaptation of them is done by Yukie Akitani, who is also serving as the chief animation director. Plot concept: The story revolves around a group of girls whose wish becomes realized with a miracle, changing the landscape of a town. "In the skies above this town, a disc is always there." PV:

 Awww the first episode was great I can't wait for the next one! Definitely following this one ! If nothing changes I will be shiping NoelxNonoka! 
  Spoiler "If the king does not lead, how can he expect his subordinates to follow?"
 I'm hooked. Animation, Music, characters, all great so far. 

 ...Everything is great but predictable, I love the animation, and the music, but the rest falls short for me so I'll give it a few more episodes. I'm not saying it's bad at all, just a reused story.

 Spoiler Alert Noel Invades Earth, kills all humans except Nonoka. That would be one hell of a plot twist lol. I like how only one person remembers Nonoka...its quite irritating. 

 And now everyone HATES Nonoka haha. This show is pretty good though, I just wanna know what the hell they wished or wanna wish for.

I don't understand this hate thing.... They were kids so they called the big giant thing in the sky so what??? They didn't even think it will work.. and it's not like Nonoka left on porpuse ... she was a kid!!! So I don't understand why hate Nonoka?

The only ones who are understanding are Souta and Koharu. I hate Yuzuki, I know she must have her reasons for hating the Saucer, but no one cares and they don't wanna join the fight. The only person who did wanna help her GOT THE **** SLAPPED OUT OF HER. I liked Noel getting embarrassed about the saucer lol

I liked Noel getting embarrassed about the saucer lol The cutness rules the world!! BTW I don't understand one thing... Nonoka didn't ask one question that she should be asking when she got her memories back '' Why do you look exactly the same as you did back then?''

 The only way I can describe this episode. T_T 

 Why don't they remember??I already cried the previous episode I don't wanna cry anymore!! 
  Spoiler "If the king does not lead, how can he expect his subordinates to follow?"
 Well they never explain anything, but that ending was good. And that animation at the end...wow. Also the Sunflower scene earlier had my heart racing, very well done. 

 Wanted a little more details about everything, but I'm fine with the ending. Could have been a little more powerful though...

 I'm still unsure how to even feel about this anime after it finished airing. The characters were sometime meh, the plot being driven around those characters kind of turned meh, but the art was great and the plot did have promise at first. I guess I wish that they had actually talked about their problems from the get go, and minus the saucer, I think a lot of it could have been resolved rather quickly instead of going around in circles for 12 episodes.
