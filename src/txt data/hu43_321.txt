He deserved that one.

I remember when he used to wish cancer upon everyone in the game friend and foe alike, and now i watch him pretty regularly, and the FIRST thing he does when he starts a game is mutes the whole other team. Every game. He literally says nothing to them during play, and when post game comes up, the lobby doesn't even materialize and he leaves. He in the VERY LEAST makes an effort to improve himself and the community by setting the example because he knows how many people watch him. Get dat scarfed, Spanish polla outta yo mouf, boi.

 You can't argue with Regi yo he will kick your ass off the team. Thats the main reason why Chaox got kicked off the team. Chaox was the only one that stepped up against Regi, arguing with him every time. Regi got annoyed and kicked Chaox when he saw a opening (was late for practice once) thats why everyone hates Regi and its not just bandwagoning. He is really immature and childish for a team leader. I'd argue he is as bad as Hotshot when it comes to being a team leader, kicking people just to play his own role. Hotshot has improved a lot though past few months. seems a lot more relaxed after stepping down, too bad we will never get to see the why nunu whys again. Reginald refuses to listen his other teammates opinions. Which is why I hate Reginald and am happy why he stepped down. The whole Reginald attitude is "I am right, you are wrong. admit it. I played flawlessly that game and you cant prove me otherwise"

 Not sure if there are **** ton of ebayers in NA gold. because I've never seen a team only get 8 kills in total, in 38 mins while feeding the sh*t out of the enemy team. BONUS Someone in ranked got mad and challenged me to a 1v1 http://www.twitch.tv/shiankiri/b/476630860 Here is it recorded the audio is slightly behind

 Yeah, the guy is obviously a douche no matter how you spin it. Perhaps it is due to the responsibility of managing a successful team, and the stress and anxiety from fear of losing would certainly arise from that, but to constantly demean teammates for taking initiative over a call they don't feel comfortable about, and using that "If you don't listen to me, get out" is a pretty poor standard of captaincy, and a vice he had never worked on improving... probably because he's a douche. ----Anyway, I'm Silver II. Top is my favourite role and Volibear is a currently my go-to champ. Starting to enjoy Jayce as a number 2. yay

Well I do say though Regi wasn't the best mid laner though and he totally sucks with fizz.

 Do you guys think Dominion should have a ranked mode...that would be cool man. I love playing Domininon and playing competive games would be awesome too.

 ARAM Ranked would make more sense since people actually play it.

Every mode should have ranked teams and solo ranked. But it will never happen because of their nooby "not enough players". Be happy with that you have... OCE can't even play 3v3 without stupid custom games.

 Nobody plays dominion. Nobody would care about a ranked mode -- just like how no one cares about ranked 3s.

I was thinking on taking back my Singed, I just remember the time I'd spend going man mode on everyone, like any other Singed actually. I really and always enjoyed him, I don't know why I stopped playing him, I was also thinking on picking up Syndra, is she viable in Ranked?

 PopstAhri AMGERD. It's funny because Ahri's a shitty champion now. Usually they release a skin and THEN nerf the champion, but I guess when you go beyond a nerf and neuter a champion completely, you release the skin afterwards to rekindle interest.

Skin for female champ. Doesn't matter what state the champ is in, foreveralones are going to buy the newest outfit for their dolls. Right Ixi? ^____________________^

Right Ixi? ^____________________^ I'm seriously considering skipping this one. I do want it, but it's a matter of principle. I won't be bought back with something like this. I'm still angry and I still think that the way they went about Ahri was wrong, and until they do something to address that issue, I'll be keeping my money.

 I'll just do it on matter of principle considering I own all other skins excepting Midnight Ahri (which I think is dumb).

It can't get any manlier without having more men and being gayer. + We have a smaller battlefield, there is no room in 3v3 for scared noobs who want to run around.
