 Galatasaray 0-4 Borussia - Bye bye CL for Galatasaray. And I don't think we can made it for Europa League either. Fantastic goal from Reus. Liverpool 0-3 Real - Easy game for Madrid. And great pass from James to CR7! Roma 1-7 Bayern - WOW! Actually I was expecting more from Roma. How come they are in the first places on Serie A? Chelsea 4-3 Sporting - Looks like a entertainment match! Olympiakos 1-0 Juve - Olympiakos look strong team at home. They already beat Atletico and now Juve.

 Thank you Roma for making me look like I don't know wtf I'm talking about. Bayern were amazing in first half they would've blown away most teams. Also Roma should've have at least 2 more goals. Nuer had no right to save some of those. http://gfycat.com/WaryDecentBinturong THAT IS A FILTHY FILTHY SAVE! With Man Sh1tty crapping the bed the return at Roma is gonna be an awesome game. Anyway. Heeeeeeallz yeah Poldi. About time we won. Disappointed in the Pool/Real game. Way too easy for Madrid. ChelseaSchalke 4-3 Sporting - Looks like a entertainment match! You're losing it man. You're losing it. Sporting also got boned by a ridiculous pen decision in the last minute as well!

 For shame Prandelli. I expected more from Gala. My halftime reaction to Bayern-Roma: I mean how the **** does Robben pull off the same trick day in and day out. Cut in from the right flank with his left and that swirler. I mean the whole world knows what he's about to do and Ashley Cole doesn't get it. A humble humiliation of Liverpool, oh so delighting. If only Suarez manages to bite someone in his 20 minute cameo tomorrow and ManU can put a 3-1 up Mourinho's arse on Sunday, it would make for a magical weekend. All right, need to get back to watching Supa Strikas. You know what that is, right? Click

 Supa strikers? looks a lot like a modern remake of the Hurricanes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERSxT9eoqjc watched it a lot when i was like 7 or 8, but anime's like Captain Tsubasa and Ganbare Kickers were more of my thing

 Originally Posted by TucemStriso but anime's like Captain Tsubasa and Ganbare Kickers were more of my thing I never felt like trying out Captain Tsubasa. It seemed like kiddy stuff. You could try out Hungry Heart Wild Striker and Giant Killing. Okay, gotta get geared up for the Manchester derby.

 Kuze, you underestimate me :P watched Hungry heart, Giant Killing, Whistle, Aoki densetsu shoot, A knight in the area...all football animes You're right about Tsubasa, it is childish, anti realistic and all that, but that show is from 1983...that's 31 years ago. I guess back then it didn't matter it took them like two episodes to go from one goal to another, and overhead kicks from 30 meters away combined with some fantasy athletic shots...but i watched that show when i was 7 or 8, it has more sentimental value than actual quality. The remake was shite, it had no soul in it, nothin... The other ones were actuall all kewl, but the only one that came close to portraying some reality in it was Giant Killing. That show kicked ass, it bended all the "anime rules" and it's actually the only one where the protagonist ain't a player but a coach.

 Seen some of Captain Tsubasa, appreciate the effort but seems like I was a decade late in it actually fitting in my viewing habits. Now The Hurricanes...loved the opening theme. But the main bad guy team (they played in white.....Germany, OBVIOUSLY) were sh1t. Seriously. I liked it when they played some obscure team who were good guys and used some kind of goodness related to their geographical location. Yes, I can't remember sh1t about that show and am just making stuff up. Anyway, Supastriker looks like something I should give the first 4 episode treatment to. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Aha, sentimental value. I get it Tuc. It's the same reason why I still find Beyblade(season 1) awesome. Okay, somebody please kill me again. I thought we'd be rising from the ashes of Moyesy's failure. The attitude's changed but not the fortunes. We don't throw away games now but we're still not peaking. The devil's luck has left us with Fergie. Boy I hope we can return the favor come Christmas and when Falcao's fully fit.

 i have no coaching qualifications. but seems to me that Moyes and Van Gaal both didn't see what was actually missing in the ManU squad and thats a tempo dictating central midfielder. Those players are rare (Iniesta, Xavi, Modrić...), but since Scholes left the club they don't have any. They need someone who plays simple one or two touches football, who always passes the ball where it needs to go. Their roster is filled with world class winger/second strikers/strikers, but they are wasted without a real central midfielder. And of course, a REAL defender...It sucks to see Rooney trying to be one, runnin around the pitch without any firm position. I used to be a fan of United when i was a kid, back in the 90s...now when people ask me who you support i say "the weaker side". How things stand, i'll once again become a ManU fan

 Ffffffffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuu..... Welp, at least Europa cup winners get a Champions League place this year. 5TH place best place. Also... http://giant.gfycat.com/IllegalPortlyGermanshepherd.gif #alexisonfire 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 didn't know about that change. but maybe for the good, the big teams might put a bit of effort in it, not just playing with third reserves like Tottenham. Alexis goal was awesome, but how they managed to concede those three, that's something only the gunners can. And two of them by the forgotten FM wonderkid Vanden Borre

 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahaha. Maybe shitty can now get back to giving Chelsea a challenge in Prem. Don't think Southampton can beat those guys. Haha, someone else mentioned 'FM wonderkid' when talking about the game and Vanden Borre. Naturally, told him to stfu. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 lol, but actually compared to a lot of other ones he still made a good career. But i guess most experts predicted that with 27yrs he'd be something like Kompany is now. I don't really now what happened to him, was it injuries, gambling issues, cheating girlfriend or just wrong club choices ? 
http://myanimelist.net/animelist/TucemStriso
 From now on I'll be watching the Galatasaray games only. Four goals guaranteed. After Sanchez's goal I can pretty much say I'm disappointed that I've yet to see someone score with his arse. I've personally witnessed my friend score with his d1ck (he would have won the Ballon D'or if it were an international match and not a school tournament) but yeah, someone needs to raise the bar.

 Alexis you beautiful beautiful man.

 Arsenal is all about Sanchez at the moment. I feel their form will pick up once Ozil comes back and Girou starts sniffing around the box. [obligatory]**** Liverpool.[/hate]
