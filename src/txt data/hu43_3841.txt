 First Time Cos-play Help
 I trying to cosplay as Choi Mochimazzi but, I have no idea how to cut the dress. It has no sleeves and is short in the front but longer in the back with a detailed collar, also she has thick gold bangles on her ankles and wrist, and a gold choker necklaces. I have no idea how to make. Any ideas would be great!
