 Anime North 2015
 I use go there annually with friends back in high school and I think, twice back in college. I got bored of it. It's the same thing each year with lackluster guests. I guess it's fun the first few times and you're joining events/cosplaying. Now it's just a waste of money and ticket price are way too high for me to consider. Only if AN 2015 invites good Japanese voice actor/actress I might consider it, but I doubt it.
