[Supernatural] Blood Lad
 Staz is the vampire boss of a section of the demon world, but he has little interest in human blood. He's more infatuated with Japanese culture. When he learns that Yanagi Fuyumi, a Japanese teenage girl, accidentally wanders into the demon city, he jumps to the occasion. However, while Staz deals with an intruder on his turf, the oblivious Fuyumi is killed by a monster and becomes a wandering ghost. The disappointed Staz vows to her that he will find a way to bring Fuyumi back to life.

 The cover really reminds me of Durarara. I know this is retarded but that gives me hopes for this anime XD (I'm joking), nah but it looks cool. 
 never seen a vampire anime, but this actually looks pretty good. ill definitely check this one out. i like the animation style too 
"I'll say it once more. I am the mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!"
 I am liking all those red eyes, yet the girl with the shy guy mask in the back is a bit disturbing. Ill watch this for sure 
 Liked the first episode, the comedy was definitely there but I'm curious to see how Staz and Fuyumi's relationship progresses. One thing that I am hearing is that it will only be 10 episodes long which is extremely disappointing considering the fact that I'm really looking forward to this series but I'm hoping that what I'm hearing isn't true. 
 First episode was great, i'm looking forward to the next.

 I think I'm actually going to like this anime. I felt like the blood scene was a reference to spirited away when chihiro almost "disappeared". 

 I like this show a lot! Love the main character's attitude towards keeping promises / always sticking to his goals. Kind of reminds me of Gintama where it can be funny but at some times really serious and touching. I'm expecting great things from this show!

 I watched the first two episodes, really liked it and i cant wait for more ^.^ 

 Although not bad, I won't be continuing this anime...of all the anime I am watching this season this one isn't as enjoyable.

 For me animation style was good.And the plot seems enjoyable to.I really like the protagonist and his behaviour.Lets hope the producers of this anime won't screw the plot.

 1st episode was great, I may have to keep watching this. 

 I put of reading the manga for the longest time that I'm pretty sure I have know idea whats going on anymore, so I'm going to just start watching the anime. Is it on Crunchyroll? 
 First episode, and this anime is hilarious!

 I saw the first episode, and idk its not my kind of anime but I have to admit I laughed a fair bit and I'll probably marathon it when its finished airing.
