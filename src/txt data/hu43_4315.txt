 Skyrim, and What I Think of It (Not a Formal Review)
 A4, Do you play Skyrim? I picked up on it here of late, and I haven't enjoyed myself so much since several years back when I played Final Fantasy XII (12). The gameplay is amazing, the story line is amazing, and the mods available are incredible. So A4, for those who play it, are there any tips and tricks a newcomer should know? 
 It was only a matter of time... Now I am one with the night and stars again... Thank you, Rhyme's Law, for your signature art work.
