[Romance] Golden Time
 Golden Time (ゴールデンタイム) is a light novel series by author Takemiya Yuyuko (Toradora!) and illustrator Komatsu Eeji. An anime adaptation has been recently announced. Tada Banri, a newly admitted student at a private law school in Tokyo, found himself completely lost after the opening ceremony, trying to find his way to the freshman orientation. Just then, he ran into another lost freshman from the same school, Yanagisawa Mitsuo, and they hit it off at once. As they were hurrying to their intended goal, with hardly any time to spare, there appeared in front of them a beautiful girl holding a bouquet of roses. The girl whacked Mitsuo across the face with the bouquet and handed the flowers over to him. "Congratulations, Freshman!", was all she said, and then she left. The stylish, well dressed, perfect woman that had swung at Mitsuo was his childhood friend, Kaga Kouko. As children she had promised to marry him one day, fulfilling her dreams. In order to escape from her, Mitsuo had gone out secretly and taken the entrance exam for this well known private college, but now there she was in the freshman orientation hall. She had taken the law school entrance exam too, and had caught up to him there. Facebook Fanpage: https://www.facebook.com/GoldenTime.GT

 I will watch an anime of this! Because i do not already have enough things on my list S: Sounds like it could be funny!

 After the genius of Toradora, I have high expectations for this! <3 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 Toradora was excellent, i hope this lives up to the expectations. I know Horie Yui from bakemonogatari and dog days, but i am unfamiliar with the other VAs. That is not a problem though.

 Great first episode! This one had lots of interesting characters... 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 Interesting ending too! 
 Dubstep Chaos Theory - ShockOne l Siren - Kat Krazy ft Elkka l Faith - BlasterJaxx 
 I am surprised I dont hate any of the Female Characters yet. Linda is probably my favorite so far, but we know little about them. And the ending I was screaming...  Spoiler WTF ITS ONLY EPISODE 1?! HOW CAN YOU END IT LIKE THAT?! lol Edit: And I just saw that Ai Kayano does the voice for Linda so that is probably another reason why i was drawn to her. Ai is one of my top 3 favorite female voice actors 

 Kinda feel bad how Kaga is always getting ignored, that's one hell of a unrequited love, but hopefully Banri is there to pick up the pieces so she can actually love someone who gives two shits about her. 
 Shes a stalker, so I cant blame Mitsuo for wanting to avoid her. She is kinda crazy, but besides the stalking thing I like her. I like Linda a lot too, but from the opening credits and everything thats happened in the first two episodes, I know she has a 0% chance of ending up with Banri. 

 Just finished the second episode! Its awesome! I hope Banri and Linda end up together. 

 BEST TEA CLUB EVER. does Banri really have a 0% chance of ending up with her? DOES HE REALLY? Surely, they'll get to know more about each other and get close. OH episode 2 has got nothing to do with episode 1 ending. WTF

 I think Banri is definitely going to end up with Kaga, and I can see where you could call her a stalked but she really cares for the dude and he just wants nothing to do with her and on top of that she has no friends so you could only imagine how she feels being blown off and not having anyone there for support. Banri notices this and he's making an effort to at least show her that someone cares she's lonely, but I do like Linda as a character and potential love interest but she really does have no chance. 
 Originally Posted by Tαќeshi I do like Linda as a character and potential love interest but she really does have no chance. Idk, I think kaga and banri wont end up together. I put my bet on linda and banri. Kaga is too obsessed with Mitsuo even though banri is showing that he cares about her I think she will just blow him off.

Did you take the time to watch the intro? lol She's going to end up with him it's basically a given all I'm anxious to see is how the story progresses and how their love develops over time. 
 Yeah I saw bits of Toradora and if this is better I'll totally check it out.

Yes but the intro could also be from the mind of banri. Your probly right but I just like linda too much to believe it.

 I'd join Linda and the Festival Club :3

Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 That tea club is too OP, it must be nerfed. 
 I think this is more about Kaga than Banri. It just seems like it, even thou it's always Banri that you see. ....that fact the she is in the front cover...:P

"Banri Tada is a newly admitted student at a private law school in Tokyo. However, due to an accident, he lost all of his memories. During his freshman orientation, he encounters another freshman from the same school, Mitsuo Yanagisawa, and they hit it off at once. Without any memory of each other, their lives become more and more intertwined as if set by the hands of fate. But what is their fate, and will it lead to happiness or another memory to forget… " 

 If I didn't know any better and I read that description blind, I would think this was about Banri x Mitsuo... xD

 Uh well that was a preyty intense episode. I knew from the start that it was some kind of cult. I hope 2D-Kun is a main character as well hes pretty funny.
