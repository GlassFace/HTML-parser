Kaga did say she was like a dog, and compared herself to Hachiko... didn't she?

 All I want is for nana-sempaii to abuse me! XD It's okay, things will still get complicated for Banri.

 Yo this was the best episode so far in my opinion. That moment when Banri went and got Mitsuo I could not stop laughing. Also his moments with Linda and that ending...omfg. Kaga is starting to get on my nerves as well.  Spoiler She's one of those clingy girls who always want their man to be focusing on them and nothing else in the world. I hate girls like that. Like he's trying to see if everything is alright between Mitsuo and Chinami and she just does not care. And she hates Chinami for no damn reason. 

 Episode 8:  Spoiler Hope for Tada and Linda is officially restored! 

 Nooooo, Linda-semmmpaiii why you say no? Yeah, Banri pretending to be gay with Mitsuo made me cry. ****ing funny.

 I have a fishy feeling about this lol I honestly think he just might end up with Linda. 
 Yeah, there is a possibility that the old Tada Banri could come back and go for Linda. 
 Dubstep Chaos Theory - ShockOne l Siren - Kat Krazy ft Elkka l Faith - BlasterJaxx 
 Yup, it looks like he forced himself to the surface for a moment there! The big conflict in this show could be an internal struggle between new Banri who loves Kaga, and old Banri who is in love with Linda... 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 I like the whole Idea of him being with Kaga but the time the new Banri spent with Linda in the show just felt right. He just seems like he belongs with her more. 
 Just started and caught up with the show and I find it to be really good. I have to say I like the idea of both Kaga and Linda so it's kinda hard to say which I would rather see him end up with in the end. Like a few people have said it just feels more natural the connection between Banri and Linda, but considering hes the new Banri and currently dating Kaga there will definitely be a internal struggle between the two like Ned said. Regardless of the outcome for the time being I'm happy with either relationship, however I do believe Kaga needs to mature a bit and not be so dependent. 
  Spoiler "In the same way"? So apparently the Banri way of comforting girls is with a french kiss! That sly dog...

  Spoiler Oh shiiiiiiiiiiit, the Old Tada Banri actually came back. I'm confused, do I want Linda and Banri or do I want Kaga or Banri? can't wait for the next episode.

I wondered the same thing while reading the light novels, and I'm wondering it again now. It's funny how great this story has translated into anime... it gets me to watch every week. That said... am I the only one getting all teary-eyed at some of the drama in this series? 
 
 Omg I jumped right out of my seat at the end of this episode. BANRI X LINDA ALL THE WAY!!!! And they may have made a sexual reference in the preview...Eiffle Tower... XD

 Episode 10  Spoiler AHHHHH!!!! I still want linda! lets go to the beach it doesnt have to be paris Lol Tada is gunna get Laid! what a great episode. Oh and found this in the comment section on CR Well played 2D-Kun, "Who knows? I don't really understand 3D girls." 

 Oh wow... looks like Banri and Kouko are gonna get it on! o_O Remember when Kaga said that she wanted to wait for their "first time" to be in Paris? Then we had this suggestive dialogue from Episode 10...  Spoiler Banri: You want to go, just the two of us? Kouko: Yeah, I do. It doesn't have to be Paris. I want to go to the beach with you. Banri: You mean... You mean.... o_O

 I love nana - semmpai. She can take care of me any day. also, it's going to be one of those beach episodes like in OC with someone getting lucky.

 The show is already good to begin with but a crazy plot twist at the end would have been if Banri was like; "Yo where's my damn picture of Linda and myself" That would have been awesome. But I feel that it will def come up in this beach episode or soon. I'm still about Banri and Linda, but 2D-kun is freaking hilarious. 

 Episode 11: Amazing episode!!  Spoiler Tada enjoyed being dressed up a little to much.
