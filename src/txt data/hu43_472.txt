 Toradora
 Here she is, the palmtop tiger, who's really cute and very feisty, she even beats up the student council president. This is one of the best pure, (ie, non fantasy) romance comedies in anime, and it is intriguing to watch just to see how it will turn out. Which boy will she choose? I recommend that you watch it if you like romance comedies, it even holds up against live action movies in that genre, or TV series etc.
