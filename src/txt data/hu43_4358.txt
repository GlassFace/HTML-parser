[Image] Girlfriend or Beard... Which do you choose?
 http://whisper.sh/whisper/050d9a56e2...rd-I-chose-the Didn't paste the pic because it was too big. Didn't know how to shrink it. Wanted to do the one where a 21 year old said he got stuck in a children's playground slide... dk where it went. But besides that, there's rude comments less-than-often, but it's okay as long as you ignore those. And some issues people talk about. Although you don't need a username to comment, you need an Ipad or similar to actually comment. Thinking about cat screams woke me up... 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
 I'd say both. But to probe deeper, is a woman's distaste for beards a blown up statistic or a realistic fixation. Do women imagine bearded men as aggressive, drunkards or future batterers? Or is this just an internet phenomenon that has led to a bandwagon effect in real life female society?

 I'd say it's an internet phenomenon, giving people an excuse to feel something like that when they feel otherwise. Internet and media are neither good or bad. If a person had a company that kept going against trends, they'd lose pretty much everything (mostly) and get a bad reputation. Internet's like that, especially when stuff spreads like wildfire in good+bad ways. It's a double-edged blade in that it puts things that the majority likes at the top, and it makes it harder for the minority to find stuff that's different from the norm, but when you find hidden gems, it's really awesome but can also be harsh depending on content, which is why it's a good reason. So culture's involved in that too. Lots know that feeling all too well. Reflecting on this makes me feel motivation to go out myself and explore the world. I will keep this in mind, Kuze. Thanks man.

 I don't mind beards. I've never dated anyone who grew out their facial hair though beyond a mustache. I do find when it starts growing out that I feel discomfort with kissing, but I have super sensitive skin. :s I don't think it'd be a deal breaker for me if a guy had a full beard though. I'm not the biggest fan of facial hair personally, but I know girls who like it or don't mind it. And really, I'm not going to let facial hair be the decider of whether or not to keep a relationship going. haha For me, it'd just be hard to be intimate with someone who has facial hair because my skin breaks out.

 You made me laugh, Shi. Reminds me of somebody I know (not putting "used to" because I will always know that forum user's kindness no matter where I go.)

 Never had a girlfriend, but I have had a beard. So i'll go with the beard. I'm big on facial hair and I wouldn't be happy being clean shaven.

 If you suddenly find yourself in a poisonous gas attack, the beard will prevent your face mask from making a good seal. Your girlfriend's going to live, you're going to die. How about them apples? 

 Generally, I like a bearded guy. *shrug*

 Haha, I'm not a fan of beards, but I don't mind beards so much if they are kept. When I see someone with a big ugly all over the place beard, I think "Eww... a bird could have built a nest in there." Sorry, but I wouldn't want anyone coming near me with that thing. Haha. Some women love beards, others don't. It has nothing to do with phenomenon on the internet lmao.

 I dont think there is anyway to generalise attraction. Everyone is different and will like different things. I went through the same ordeal when getting my tattoo and came to the conclusion that it made me happy to have it. So other people didnt have to like it, but if they do its great

 I only like certain face structures bearded so I would say it depends but if I like the guy and he doesn't look good with a beard like I'm not attracted because of that he should get rid of it and then let me be attracted to him without one XD lol 
 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses.

 You should never need to choose. If you want to have a beard, you should date someone that likes them, or likes you enough that a new look (should you go from no beard to beard) won't negatively affect the way they feel about you. I got lucky and have a beard that I love, and a girlfriend that loves it just as much.

 Basically everything struggz said and some. If a woman doesn't like your beard, then keep it movin to the next chick. Most chicks that don't like facial hair are usually young and haven't yet been with a Manly man yet. They are still into Justin Beiber looking kids. -_- Look at all the male celebs. Everybody went from clean faced to rocking facial hair of some kind.

 Um it's just a beard. I highly doubt a beard in of itself has ruined many relationships... The contempt, distain, and stubbornness causing either side wanting/not wanting a beard may be the last thread that unraveled a relationship. But there were definitely many other issues that led to that point.

 I for one, love my beard, and would not be comfortable shaving for anyone. imo some people are not meant for beards. If you can't truly grow one/yours is unruly.... please do us all a favor and shave it or keep it maintained. However, I don't have a preference. It depends on the person.
