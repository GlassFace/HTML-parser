 Can Americans Make Anime?
 Can they? Read on here! http://www.bubblews.com/news/4465510...ans-make-anime P.S. Yes they can :3 
High as a kite in another world.
 I just glanced through the article. Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't the robotech shadow chronicles movie American made? It was good but just didn't go far enough to recapture the original series. Also it ended in a strange spot. Good movie though. Edit - yes yes I know the original robotech was a redone story of the macross series which was Japanese. Of course I know that....

 From an art style perspective, why not? From a country perspective, Japan already outsource some of its animation, so why not?

 "Anime" as we think of it falls under several definitions. If the definition of it is "japanese animation", then no. If the definition encompasses the style of art, then yes.

If the definition encompasses the style of art, then yes. This. Americans are capable of doing it, although the term they use for the style is animesque. Series like these include Avatar: The Last Airbender, Legend of Korra, and the old Teen Titans cartoon.

 Sure they can! I don't see why not... 
 Yes they can ...but I don't think that a from comics made show can be called anime ....

 Western style animation is called 'cartoon.' i.e. Southpark, The Boondocks, Simpsons, Etc. Movies from Disney or Pixar are called animations. Japanese animation is called 'anime.' Because of universally distinct designs. You won't be able to name many anime (Excluding 3d animations) that did not follow this formula.

Japanese don't make a distinction between whats made in Japan and whats made elsewhere in the world. The concept that only animation from Japan is anime is specifically a western concept. In Japan there is no distinction between art styles either, even Disney movies are called anime in Japan.

Yes, I agree. It is a social construction by culture, but the premise of the thread is, "Can Americans Make Anime?" Which should then be discussed from the American perspective; rather than looking at the base root of the word. The article OP posts uses the lack of clear juxtaposition between american cartoon and Japanese anime to make an argument of comparison. But I take fault with that since it disregards social vernacular in favor of concise language (like you pointed out, but the author of the article is kinda BSing you).

 Tekkonkin Kreet (http://myanimelist.net/anime/2154/Tekkon_Kinkreet) is an anime written and directed by westerners (though it's Japanese) and is considered anime, so I'd say yes, we are capable Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk 
 Human beings can do almost anything if they put their mind and hearts into an art or an idea (and also when a sufficient or good budget allows). Even China has borrowed and learned from American, Japanese, and also Korean animation techniques to a point to where they are now able to do this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA0JVAeSibc This gives me the chance to add here that the history of Japanese animation, as mentioned in interviews from Japanese animation production artists, is that they were inspired, learned, and borrowed techniques from America, France, and Russia while developing their own style within their own culture.

 "It's all about family -- really."
 The Five Killers would had been one, but too bad it was canceled. 

 Couldn't get to the article, but we would definitely be able to do it, but the real question is if we would actually do it. We definitely might have some of our own ideas for what would be in it and our type of comedy or something would be thrown in, but we might even have some new really deep stories stuck in some of our heads that could very well become a new really popular anime in and out of good ol' Murica

 Yes you can make an anime style animation, but it cannot be considered an anime if it is not from japan, because the only difference between a anime and a cartoon is that anime is a japanese cartoon, and a cartoon is just, a cartoon 
 since anime is such a specific niche in the US, it's highly unlikely that we will see anime massively produced in the US, but it's not entirely impossible. A good team, a good streaming site, Youtube and Patreon donations could cut the job 
 There are people on this board who didn't watch Totally Spies.  Spoiler I guess it's French Canadian, but I think the question was really "can western entertainment emulate Japanese anime style." Yes, yes it can. Also Teen Titans.  Spoiler And yeah I picked crappy clips, and yeah the quality is bad, fiteme1v1m8 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 Well, I mean, Teen Titans and Avatar: The Last Airbender are explicitly inspired by anime.

 Well think about this. Several "Japanese" anime is animated in Korea. Since Japan didn't animate it, it is anime? My standing is it doesn't matter who animates it, its a style of animation that allows it to be called anime.

 America can do ANYTHING! We will take your ideas and make them better! Ha! ...Or, at least, we're pretty good with taking cultures and making them semi-awesome. Maybe a liddo cheaper, less awesome. Idk. Butcheah. We're awesome ^_^

But I do agree we can take other peoples ideas and make em cool in our own way..... Not that they weren't cool to begin with... just cooler in a different way....

 You could call Teen Titans an anime............. or you could call it a cartoon with an anime feel The Last Airbender and Legend of Korra are definitely considered anime shows though 
 Technically not since an Anime's creation is dependant on it's Japanese origin. Americans, and pretty much every other nations can make an animated series using the same style as an Anime, but it is still not an Anime by definition of the term. 
 No, they cannot. They can copy the style and make cartoons that mirror or appear like anime, but they cannot make an anime that isn't made in Japan. Avatar may look like anime a little, but it isn't. Rwby may look like anime, but it isn't. I'm not dissing american animation, but just because something looks like anime doesn't mean it is.
