 How do you stay motivated??
 Signing up and putting money down for an event keeps me motivated. XD Especially $350 worth of my money into a running event. That'll get me motivated to make sure that I'm fit enough to at least finish! That and my annual doctor visits and my attempt to beat my cholesterol score. XD
