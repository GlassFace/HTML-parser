 If you could turn a game into an anime...
 If you could choose a game you played that you would want as an anime, which would you choose? I would choose 'Yume Nikki'. It's a Japanese made game about exploring one's dreams (the sleepy kind). An RPG maker game so already quite similar to the anime style, very surreal and symbolic. I think it would be good. It's a masterpiece of a game, methinks.
