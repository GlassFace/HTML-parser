 Japan outraged at ISIS Beheading of Hostage.
 http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31075769 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan "would not give in to terrorism" and that he would expand his support to countries fighting IS. IS has cited Japanese aid as a reason for the hostage taking. The video comes less than a week after the apparent beheading of another Japanese man, Haruna Yukawa. Mr Goto, 47, a respected journalist known for his work covering the suffering of civilians in war zones, went to Syria in October, reportedly to try to secure Mr Yukawa's release. The video, which has all the hallmarks of previous IS propaganda videos, has not been authenticated, but Japanese officials believe it is genuine. Rupert Wingfield-Hayes: "The Japanese PM has taken a very tough line" Mr Abe called it a "heinous act", adding that Japan would work with the international community to bring those responsible for Mr Goto's apparent murder to justice. There has been strong condemnation from the US and other allies in the fight against IS. Mr Goto's mother Junko Ishido said she was speechless at his death, saying he had gone to Syria out of "kindness and courage". Japanese officials had been working with Jordan to secure the release of Mr Goto and a Jordanian pilot, Moaz al-Kasasbeh, who was shot down over Syria in December. However, earlier on Saturday they said negotiations had become deadlocked. An IS video released on Tuesday had said Mr Goto had "only 24 hours left to live" and Mr Kasasbeh "even less". They later gave a deadline of sunset on Thursday for a deal by which Mr Goto would be freed in return for Jordan releasing captured Iraqi militant Sajida al-Rishawi. But the deal may have been complicated by Jordan's demand that Mr Kasasbeh also be released. Was a bit reluctant to post this..but seeing as this is one of the few current events I've been following as of late, it's apparently come to the worst conclusion that there is. Thoughts and opinions?

 I saw a small blip of the story on CNN at work. I was just really really saddened. I couldn't even think about it.

 I feel bad that I can't do anything about it... anything can happen after this. If I could, I would shoulder the whole world on my shoulders, but it's really up to every person to make the decision. A scar is almost never great at first, but if you get comfortable with it and wear it proudly towards the end, then your love for people will become even stronger. That's one way to warm up. Our generation has the power to do this as we become stronger, no matter the age. 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.

Two Italians and one Dane are officially kidnapped by ISIS. Several other reporters and foreign NGO workers might be held captive as well. .

Lay off the drugs and stop trying to make every comment some profound philosophical statement. The beheading was in the news today but it didn't seem to have any more priority than normal. If there is an outrage the news didn't make a note of it. No one I know is really talking about it. Its just typical shoganai as usual here.

I find it interesting that it didn't take priority in the news there. Here, the media covers the story until they wring it dry. BREAKING NEWS was stamped at least 3 times on every news channel. It makes me wonder about the differences between American news/media/journalism and that of Japan's.

It makes me wonder about the differences between American news/media/journalism and that of Japan's. There aren't corporate news channels like FOX and CNN etc. Its just local news shows that come on at set times of the day. Every news I saw lead with the terrorist story but it didn't consume the entire broadcast like it would in the US. Unlike in the US, news in Japan is still about informing the public and not about keeping people watching for as long as possible to make money.

I respect the courage people have to go on the line, even if it gets them killed in the process. It's a shame they were captured, and while their outcome won't discourage others with the same interests I guess the only thing I can say and hope for is that IS have less success in future.

 Sadly ISIS is gonna keep existing until they make someone mad enough that they wipe do something drastic and cause a massacre. Either way, it's definitely a tragedy. I think the best advice that everyone should hear is... STOP GOING TO THE MIDDLE EAST!

I think the best advice that everyone should hear is... STOP GOING TO THE MIDDLE EAST! ISIS is a problem now because the US decided that Al Qaeda needed to be wiped out. ISIS will just be replaced by an even worse group if the US continues to drop bombs and kill innocent people in the collateral damage. The US causes otherwise harmless people to take up the cause of jihadists when they see their family burned alive from a Predator drone strike.

You mean 'harmless' Sunnis that looked the other way when Shiites and other minotires were slaughtered? Don't fight terror when it doesn't affect you, not your problem. Fight the US when they make a mistake trying to fight terror. Great logic, I hope as many of those 'harmless' flock to the jihadists so we can wipe them all out.

Great logic, I hope as many of those 'harmless' flock to the jihadists so we can wipe them all out. Shia and Sunni muslims lived together peacefully until imperial intervention in the middle east which overthrew diplomatically elected leaders and replaced them with puppet dictators who imposed religious law which led to religious persecution of the Shia minorities. Meanwhile 9/11 was perpetrated by Saudi Arabians and the Saudi government is an absolute monarchy that imposes extreme sharia law on its citizens and beheads 4x the amount of people that ISIS does but nobody bats an eye. It couldn't possibly be because they supply the majority of the worlds oil could it? What was that about not fighting terror when its not your problem? But you have a point, US intervening int he middle east with massive violence has worked so well for the past 4 decades we have to be close to solving the problem. Maybe we only need another 10, 50, or 100 years of more violence and killing another 200,000 people and THEN all of the middle east's problems will be solved! Or you're just an idiot, could go either way.

Yeah and what difference does that history lesson make now? Maybe the USAF should start dropping history text books. Originally Posted by Grey Meanwhile 9/11 was perpetrated by Saudi Arabians and the Saudi government is... ...What was that about not fighting terror when its not your problem? . Am I talking about Saudis or US foreign policy? Originally Posted by Grey But you have a point, US intervening int he middle east with massive violence has worked so well for the past 4 decades we have to be close to solving the problem. Can you quote me on that?

Or you're just an idiot, could go either way. Lol would of been easier just to call me an idiot and save the rant, or you don't have much of a life, could be either one. haw haw haw I'm witty too. F*** off.

I think the best advice that everyone should hear is... STOP GOING TO THE MIDDLE EAST! It took this many hostages for the US to say this. Plus the fact that there are 17 soldiers not being shown on tv that have been murdered by isis. You can find these videos on Worldstarhiphop 

 Sure... Blame the U.S. Cause it's not like a million other people already are. Cliche. People like ISIS are always gonna exist. World peace will never be achieved as long as Humans are the ones trying to secure it. To say dropping bombs or not dropping bombs will change anything is foolish. Either way, someone is gonna die and someone will mourn that death. It's a tragedy none the less. Eventually someone will decide to wipe out ISIS, or our world will eventually revolve around trying not to die at the hands of terrorists. Once they die, someone new will rise up. As you say, death breeds death. So how do you suppose we stop more death at the hands of men seeking blood? I'm not going to say I support bombings. But for someone completely against it, I do want to know what alternatives you have in mind. 
 I'd blame the world telling the Syrian rebels to **** themselves when they desperately needed help rather than a military campaign against extremism. Does a military response help drive up recruitment to these things? Yeah, just look at how Isreal drives the Palestinians to conflict by disproportionate use of force among civilian populations. Really though Al-Qaeda was pretty much finished, so much so that we saw several leadership splits with Mama-queda. The more they're associated with attacks on civilians throughout the Middle-East the more they push sympathetic populations away. If you look into recent events in Syria you'll find that the original phase of the conflict was fought by a coalition of fairly secular units. There used to be journalists embedded in Rebel units, with many of the rebels dying to get these people to safety on the hope that their story might gain the sympathy of the rest of the world. Iran and Russia stepped in, and the US came down with a case of cold feet, leaving the rebels to a meat-grinder. Naturally they turned to the people with money, weapons, and manpower in the region. This bolstered the status of the extremists real quick as they could claim they were fighting to help their fellow muslims. Gradually it no longer became a choice, you either joined up with the Big-Baghdadi gang, or you were permanently on its shitlist. It was really only a matter of time before the forces were radicalized without outside intervention, now it's rare but there are still a few secular forces fighting both ISIS and Assad's regime.

Pretty much that. Also, ISIS are pretty useful for furthering geo political and domestic aims of....well pretty much every relevant nation on Earth. They ain't going anywhere for a while and its not because 'herp derp we can't kill all of them.' Killing people has never been a problem for a modern army. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro?

They are waging a war with words, spilling less bloodshed than most wars, and have yet to really be stopped. They use the media to their advantage. That takes a certain element of skill.
