 great episode, once again **** is going down. L-Elf revealing the truth about the Chancellor of Dorussia, what will the world do? the ARUS president is tied up with the council of 101 as well, are they going to turn on Dorussia and side with the "monsters?" Will Haruto lose all of his memories about Shoko and die? Find out on the next two remaining episodes! Two episodes remaining? it happened so quick, I don't want it to end.
