 Dark Souls 2
 Well.. This game has taken over my gaming life for the most part. I love the game, its deliciously difficult! I have a lot of fun playing it and the boss fights are massive in size, and are incredibly rewarding. So? Has anyone else played the game? And if so, what boss did you have the most trouble with? And what boss if your favourite? (Note: I did not beat the game yet... So please no spoilers.) 
 I dont' understand the appeal of a game that is purposely set to an insane difficulty level? Or at least the constant death thing. Is it the Rocky mentality that you always got to get back up into the fight no matter what? I like a good challenge don't get me wrong. But I want something that's winnable. Or at least not something that is total grinding without much variety. by the way I haven't played either but i was just wondering what the appeal was......

 Liked it at first (152 hours played and platinum trophy), but then I played Demon's Souls and the first Dark Souls, and recognized just how disappointing it was in comparison. The first dlc pack was just released, and I'm not even going to bother with it.

 It's the weakest souls game but it's still addicting as ****. My favorite boss is Freja. I had the most trouble with the ruin sentinels. I didnt dislike the boss, but it does have a lot of double team/crowd control bosses. I prefer one giant monster. Although I guess technically Freja is crowd boss as well. 
 See your seeing the game at face value, "Why would I force myself through a game that is SO difficult?" But its more complex then that... My best example for this is when I was playing the game there is a boss called The Pursuer, he hits hard (Killing you in about 2 or 3 hits at the normal level you fight him) and moves fast. I fought him and died many times... MANY times, but I didn't give up. I learned his attack patterns, and learned my weapons, I learned when to strike and how to beat him. Its much like a chess game, and when his Health reached 0... I-I felt amazing, it was the most rewarding thing ever. You might also be confusing difficult, for unfair. Which Dark Souls is not... Ever. Dark Souls is completely fair in every way, there is no auto hitting from enemies, every attack can be dodged or blocked, and every boss has its strengths to watch out for and weaknesses to punish. You see a Dragon in the distance? You have a bow? You can hit it... Every move, every action, every single thing is telegraphed in the game. And the rewards for beating bosses or finding hidden rooms.. Makes the whole game worth it. (You could gain multiple levels worth of souls, or a new epic sword that does so much damage and looks awesome, or even you could get a new ally!) The appeal in short, is how rewarding the game is, to conquer the the beast when the odds are equal. To learn about your enemy and make strategies. I hoped that helped you understand! 
 Well, your probably looking at the game in comparison to how iconic the other games where. I mean EVERYONE remembers the four knights and how awesome Artorias was. Everyone remembers Solare and to Praise the Sun, and everyone remembers the Dragon God and how epic the fight was. And yes the difficulty is a little lessened in some areas in Dark Souls 2, but in my opinion it has a stronger story. Where in Dark Souls 1 it was a conflict between the Undead and rekindling the first flame (Or not). In this its a more internal conflict between the fear of losing ones self and losing everything you were. The hollowing was done much better in Dark Souls 2, and it is treated the way it should... Its horrifying! To forget who you once were and turn into some monster. The Hollowing itself is actually an allegory for Alsymers Disease. I personally like Dark Souls 2 more because of the story. 
 How'd you beat the Ruin Sentinels in the end? I managed to find a summon sign for this NPC cleric who just blasted the living hell out of them with lightening.

None of that is what DkS2's story is about. It's not the focus, anyway. It's just fluff. The story is about traversing the obstacles Vendrick set up before retiring to the Crypt, which he created to prevent Nashandra from reaching the Throne, which she swoops in at the end in an attempt to take, after using you to open the path.

 .... What... What did I say about Spoilers... Your just seeing the story on the surface! Why did the Undead first go the Drangleic? To reverse the Hollowing, that's what the whole first cut scene is about. The entire theme of the game is about losing ones self to something out of their control! 
 What you're talking about is still a tertiary part of the story. The underlying story is still the perpetual and inevitable waning and waxing of the First Flame, and that it's seemingly a never-ending cycle of light and near-dark. Hollowing and everything about it is just a symptom of this cycle, as hollows multiply as the Flame wanes. It's not, and never has been, a central part of the story. It's a jumping off point for the games, and helps explain some of the mechanics (just like convoluted time and the crossing over of worlds is used to explain the multiplayer).

 Very true.. Perhaps I should do a little more research myself. Though my thoughts about this are more, personal I suppose. Because I go into Dark Souls 2 much like the character did, not knowing what he's doing but simply going where he must to try and beat the curse, and considering I haven't gotten much plot yet other then that, I formed my ideas on that fact. And to be the Hollowing was the thing most characters talked about in the game. My favourite character has to be Lucatial because of this, a noble and fearless warrior, horrified at the thought of forgetting herself. I found her story tragic, so I suppose I guess I attached myself a bit to much to that theme of losing ones self. Though in my defence I would like to say this.. In the first game, it was more focused on that. The cycle of the First Flame, in this (As I said) it seems more focused on the individual and the effects of the hollowing. Though I have not beaten the game, so what do I know.. It might pull a Bioshock and within the last hour completely change the story. 
 @ecilam - OK if its fair that's better. I have so many games I still need to go through I won't even think of trying it. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

The only things in this game that deal with that are the opening cinematic, the encounters with Lucatiel, and some other npc dialogue here and there. Like I said, a springboard and fluff.

 I think your being a little unfair! Just because you don't like it doesn't mean everybody else shouldn't play it! 
 Originally Posted by Ecilam-Nellus I think your being a little unfair! Just because you don't like it doesn't mean everybody else shouldn't play it! It's more than me simply not liking it as much as the others. It's not as good as the others. It's an extremely watered-down Souls experience. The atmosphere isn't there. The music isn't there. The enemy variety isn't there. The difficulty isn't there. The level design, and world cohesion isn't there. The coherent lore isn't there. Dark Souls 2 was developed by FromSoft's B-team, and it's painfully obvious. Unfortunately for all of us, is that it was financially successful, and with it's greedy episodic dlc, it's only going to be more successful. This tells From to produce more of the same garbage, rather than returning to form -- hopefully we'll get this in Bloodborne, though, with Miyazaki's influence (whose absence was too noticeable in DkS2).

 Wow.. You really are a sour-puss aren't you? This is all your opinion. Because EVERY person I know says the games okay. Just because you left the game with a bad taste in your mouth doesn't mean everyone else should just avoid it. And oh? You would have liked it to go financially unsuccessful? Okay, maybe From Software can just make money from nothing for the next game. I'm not trying to be mean, but your being unreasonable! The game is fine! Sure its arguably not as good as the others, but I still have fun with it, and I know millions of other people would agree with me! Just let it be what it is, a good game! I started this thread to discuss the good times people had on Dark Souls 2, not argue about it being bad. Now can we get past this and just agree that you don't like it and many other people do?

Agrees with me but still argues, "well, that's just like, your opinion, man." top lel I never said it was a bad game in general. Just that it's a bad Souls game. In general, it's pretty good, but pales in comparison to its predecessors; it's disappointing. Maybe you should agree that you like it and many others don't? c wut i did thar?

 I have not played Demon Souls, I own Dark Souls 1 though. (Demon Souls is one my list.) And I heard this from someone and think it fits. In the world we live in almost all good games that come out are seven out of tens where Demon Souls and Dark Souls are nine point fives, and Dark Souls 2 is an eight point five. Little point.. I only know one person who has ever said "Top lel" before... and for a moment I thought you were him. XD Little note, I got the DLC and started to play it... Holy poop, I almost dropped my fudge within the the first five minute's because I walked forward to a thing that looked like a giant ass dead dragon with a big spear in its back (Much like Orinstiens) It had green blood, and a silver body... I walked to it and said aloud... There is no way in hell that thing is dead. And sure enough it gets up and pimps out. The next thing I said was" I'm going to have to kill that aren't I..." It was a large range of emotions... 
 Demon's Souls - 8.8/10 Dark Souls - 8.8/10 Dark Souls 2 - 8.5/10 Going to Demon's after playing the Dark Souls games is going to feel weird, though. It's easy to forget how floaty Demon's Souls feels. Of the three games, Dark Souls feels by far the best, control-wise. Dark Souls nails the interconnectedness, and Dark Souls 2 does a merely decent job at recreating it. Dark has the best level design, despite a handful of really stupid things. Dark Souls 2 improves the AI a lot and simplified crafting, both for the better. And Dark Souls 2 is still better than 90% of anything out there.

The Dark Souls games are both extremely floaty -- DkS2 much more so. The movement and combat in Dark Souls was weighty, but rolling, jumping, and falling were all very floaty. Demon's Souls was extremely tight, responsive, and immediate. The rolling and i-frames are ****ing beautiful in that game. As far as things like fall damage go, though, Demon's Souls is absolutely floaty. Fall damage hardly exists in DeS (which I was very thankful for, going back to 2-1 so much, dropping down to the smith to avoid needing to use the elevator), whereas it's increasingly deadly in the Dark Souls games, becoming actually pretty ridiculous in DkS2. Dark Souls does have the overall best level design, although Demon's Souls has a couple unmatchable high points for me -- Tower of Latria is goddamn perfect, and the Valley of Defilement is everything that Blighttown and the Gutter/Black Gulch aspired to be. Dark Souls 2's is horrid, though. Areas feel too much like video game levels, and not actual locations. Then of course there's things like the infamous 'Iron Keep being located in what could only be a separate dimension above Earthen Peak' thing...etc.
