Apologies I meant Elementz since Chaox left the team I haven't liked TSM at all really, and I think its a little rude to insult people right off the bat like that. TSM didn't win that game, but Elementz did. Simple as that. That was all I wanted to say. Also Buddy if I focus on LoL I won't have time focusing on other things thanks. I don't camp out and watch LCS all-day and likely won't be watching the all-star game. Last year I missed the championships even, so forgive me if I mix names up. I don't make LoL my life and if people acted less like it was a simple way to earn a living and dreaming about it maybe people wouldn't be so arrogant to people who would rather enjoy a game. You fell in love with Hafu so hard that her attempt to get more male attention drove you into a rage of jealousy so bad that you abandoned your quest for her heart, yet I'm the one with no life? LOL. Just so you know it's not exactly hard to remember things. Humans are actually programmed to have functional memories, but you apparently can't even remember two players' names. I know you're busy with your minimum wage job, but you should at least try harder.

Nobody mentions any of Dyrus or Wildturtle's mistakes that and it's all about "hurr Regi TF so bad." In the end their teamfight coordination was on another level from the other NA teams and that brought their victory. It's worth mentioning that although it wasn't the best idea at the time, Reginald's split push at bot contributed to the win as well. Pursuing Dignitas when they were pushing mid was quite dangerous and TSM was at least going to lose an inner turret there either way. They took dragon and split pushed bot, and ended up losing an inhibitor, but it could have been a lot worse. That was more of Dignitas playing smartly than TSM playing poorly. Honestly, as much as people hate to hear it, Regi is probably the best NA mid. He can't compare to EU or KR mids, but it is what it is. Scarra's just not that good. I mean, he's surely in top 3 in NA, but Reginald is better. Like all other great mids he doesn't focus on winning his lane, but working with the jungler to get bot and top as fed as possible. People love to give Regi **** for his gameplay because it's just another bandwagon to jump on, and the LoL community loves bandwagons. Regi had a few poor placements with TF's ult, as everyone who has ever used TF has, but overall he used it effectively. He used it safely. Every time he failed to secure a kill with it, Twitch chat exploded, because they expected him to port into the middle of Dig as they were running away, because who cares if you suicide when you don't need to as long as you get that kill, right? People love to ignore performances like his Karthus game against GGU just a few hours before the Dig game.

 Nah man if Genesis were supporting instead of Elementz he would have won that game. If there are two things he's good at, they're LoL and making minimum wage. LOL!

 Supports = Backbone IGN: Renegade1880 
 Lol... all dat talk bout da high playerz... >.> I watched a stream few days ago, don't see its so epic. Anyways... I went like 1-13 with diana, biggest fail ever lol... and it was a leblanc/leesin who owned me. Got dced at lvl 2 and **** went downhill when I was a -2 diana 1v2. I hate champs who can jump in, do a lot of damage, then instantly jump out. But on my smurf, people don't always ban blitz So free wins there. Also... I like this song... but it pisses me off at the same time, because I keep thinking hes saying Baron Nashor -.-'

 Just carried hard as a 2-16 or something ap xin. LoL is sooo fun when you can solo destroy both nexus turrets at full hp without your own minions or any team mates, and 2 of the enemies attacking you. I am the kawaii Moon, Enemy nexus is Earth, the tsunami is my overwhelming power and the innocent people are the enemies. =D  Spoiler

 I was just wondering, What are you guys, top 3 champs as far as win ratios go? Ya know like which champs you played that have you have the most wins with. Im honestly just curious to see who people are good with. For the most part It looks like Im a tank kinda person. My top 3 just happen to be Malphite, Blitzcrank, and Nautilus. Makes sense though since when I have a losing streak its always one of those champs that get me a win.

 Idk about ratios, but my top 3 used in ranked are: Diana, Caitlyn, Sona/Morgana Just had easiest ranked game >.> I was 3 lvls higher than the 2nd highest lvl... Didn't noticed until last 2 minutes of the game and was like wdf? why you all so underlvled -.- http://img802.imageshack.us/img802/378/easygame.png

Morgana 9-0 100%, Teemo 75% and (EUW) Lee Sin 100% 9-0. my other winratios are quite average but I think I have atleast 55-60% on champions that I main.

 Originally Posted by BuddyLee I... I don't play that much ranked. Same. I've only got about 25-30 games played in ranked, and the most games I have played with any one champ is 7, and that's Master Yi (jungle), and I won 5/7 of those games. Everyone else are at 1-3 games, most of which are perfect records one way or another--all wins or all losses. Once I decide to get back into ranked I think I'm going to stick to playing adc whenever possible. Despite it not being my preferred role, it's the one I do the most consistently well in. I should probably capitalize on that.

 Out of the champions I play in ranked often Jax is my highest win rate with around 70%. The other 2 are Caitlyn with 65% and Tristana who I play the most with 60%. If it counts im 2-0 as Warwick xD

 So Elementz is now a free agent. I heard that he was leaving Curse a few days ago, but I couldn't find any info on it at the time, so I thought it was just a rumor. Now I find out it's actually true. Still a reserve player for the team for a while, but as of now he's been replaced by Rhux. http://www.surrenderat20.net/2013/04...-and.html#more

 Yep, read about it a few days ago. Not surprised to say the least. Saint was too much for him.

 Nasus nerfs incoming. At least on his wither, I'm sure. He's pretty much omnipresent right now.

 I have been playing really well lately. I normally would just play whatever role was available but I have started to ask for mid every game because it is the role I enjoy playing most and have been able to make plays and have had really good games over the last couple weeks. What makes it even more fun is that I have had success with a good number of champs mid lately and not just taking advantage of one.

Leona and Lux I think are both above 50% for me on up to 4 games each I think. I love it how I main support but no one wants to play top in ranked because they know they suck in ranked which is why so many people play it in normals so they can get better. Sadly I fill in all the time which is a bad decision. I'm around 50/50 in ranked games I think

Sadly I fill in all the time which is a bad decision. Thats a good decision... I main support. But unless you have a premade team, you NEED to play a carry role such as adc/mid/top/jungle to ensure that at least 1 of the people on your team can carry. Because face it, a 7-2 support wont carry anyone. Unlesss your an ad pantheon support... I'd much rather have a bad support and a good mid laner or adc.
