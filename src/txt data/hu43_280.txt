 Server Downtime
 As I am sure many of your noticed, A4 was down for the last 24 hours or so. This was due to some much needed server maintenance. However, it wasnt expected that it needed to be done this early hence no warning to the users. On the up side, the forum should be "snappier" with its page load times. 
Owner and Admin of A4, Feel free to message me but PLEASE make sure your question isnt already answered in the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) Forum located HERE.
