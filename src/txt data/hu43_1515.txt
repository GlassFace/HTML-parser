 'Sup.
 Hey guys! Just wanted to say hello, and I was wondering if you'd seen a Shinigami anywhere. You know, tall, immortal, and as ugly as my pet toad when it scrunches its face up. Thanks! 
 Yo welcome to the forums, mate! Nope, I haven't seen an ugly Shinigami around here. But I did spot a good-looking one, he's standing beside me! 

 Welcome. Weird question, and description of your toad >.> But... Have fun on A4.

 Welcome to A4, and no I have not seen anyone like that 
  Spoiler 
 Hey "I'm a gay Th gil" (read your name in backwards... sorry I couldn't resist XD) Yeah, I've seen him. Killed 'em with a bunch of Quincy arrows. Didn't put much of a fight. I thought he was gonna slash me with his zanpakutou, but then he pulled out a black book instead. Sorry... Anyway, Welcome to A4, mate

 I thought you were talking about the new breakfast cereal based on the monster. (Uh, it goes well with milk - and vodka too I think). Welcome.

 Haha, you guys are hilarious.
