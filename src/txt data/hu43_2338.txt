 The 1632 Series
 This book series, by Eric Flint, is an alternate history book series. It focuses around the West Virginian town of Grantville and it's residents. Without going too far into it, basically this late 20th century town is, through a freak accident, transferred to 17th century germany, in the region known as Thuringia. Labeled as wizards and witches at first, the German people, and most of the rest of the world, begin to see the future Americans as a miracle from God. Or, in some cases (particularly for the French), they are seen as Devils, come to Earth to ruin the 'good Christian people'. What ensues as a result of the 20th century meeting the 17th is both hilarious and appalling. You see the result of it change history across the world. Everything from military arms to political situations are changed. In this 24 book series nations rise and fall. People who should be dead live. People should live die. People who should have never been are born and take their place on the world stage. Truthfully, this is one of my favorite book series, despite the convoluted written order by the author. To reduce confusion, see the suggested reading order below. Love it or hate it, this series is one of the best in circulation. 1632 Ring of Fire I Grantville Gazette I 1633 Grantville Gazette II 1634: The Baltic War The Danish Scheme Grantville Gazette III 1634: The Ram Rebellion 1634: The Galileo Affair 1634: The Bavarian Crisis Grantville Gazette IV Ring of Fire II 1635: The Cannon Law 1635: The Dreeson Incident 1635: The Tangled Web Grantville Gazette V 1635: The Papal Stakes 1635: The Eastern Front 1636: The Saxon Uprising Ring of Fire III 1636: The Kremlin Games 1636: Seas of Fortune
