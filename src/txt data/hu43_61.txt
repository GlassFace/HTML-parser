 isn't it weird
 when i write something out onto the forums to share with the people, it's always neat and well written and sounds kind of intelligent, but when i would try to say it to someone face to face, it will come out clumsy and disorganized and just the exact opposite of how i see it mentally? cmon who else is suffering from this disease?
