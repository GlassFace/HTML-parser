[Action] Seirei Tsukai No Blade Dance
 Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance (精霊使いの剣舞 Seirei Tsukai no Bureido Dansu?, a.k.a. Bladedance of Elementaler) is a light novel series written by Yū Shimizu with illustrations by Hanpen Sakura. It was one of five MF Bunko J light novel anime adaptations announced at Media Factory's Summer School Festival event on July 28, 2013. Kamito Kazehaya (カゼハヤ・カミト Kazehaya Kamito?) The world's only male elementalist. While lost in the spirit forest he wanders upon Claire purifying herself in a lake and subsequently being attacked. He follows her to a sealed sword spirit which runs wild and in order to save her forms a contract with it. While initially unable to open a gate to the sword spirit due to his past contract, he manages to do so when Claire recklessly tries to contract a demon spirit. He was raised as an elite assassin by the Institutional School where all emotion was destroyed. But after meeting Restia, who taught him everything about the world he changed. He later escapes along with the sealed artifact holding Restia when the Institutional School was destroyed by a rampant spirit. Three years before the events of the novel he participates in the Blade Dance under the guise of Ren Ashbell and becomes The Strongest Blade Dancer. He is constantly embarrassed about this when the girls say how they admire Ren Ashbell and Fianna uses this to tease him. He is oblivious to his team mate's (and other girl's) feelings for him which often gets him into situations that he doesnt quite understand only for Claire to incinerate him. He is called 'Demon King of the Night' (and eventually daylight) due to his somehow making every girl he comes in contact with fall for him.
