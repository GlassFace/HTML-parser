 Osu!
 Recently got into Osu about 3 or 4 months ago and I have to say I really enjoy it. The skill level cap is absolutely insane, but I think that's why I love this game. This game can be either extremely fun and casual or extremely serious and competitive. I just wanted to know if anyone plays Osu. It's a pretty fun game in my opinion and it also has anime stuff in it as well which is always a nice touch.
