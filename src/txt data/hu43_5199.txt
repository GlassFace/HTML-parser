[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Seems like Haruto is finally starting to grow a spine. I thought for the longest that he and Kira Yamato was having a 'spineless off- ignore the reality of the world' competition. I just wish they showed more backstory with the various factions and how they all came to power.
