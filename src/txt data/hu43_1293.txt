 Scared or Nervous Around the Opposite Sex?
 I've kind of been noticing a bit more lately that I'm a bit nervous when around any guys I don't really know even if they are cute and perfectly nice guys. Especially if a guy shows an interest in me, I kind of freak out and skip a beat on the inside, and I've even stopped dressing up for the most part (literally just wearing a t-shirt and loose kung fu pants most days even on outings). I know it's kind of a lame thread, but I've been in a thread-making mood, and just wondering if others ever have trouble being around the opposite sex (or the same sex if that works too).
