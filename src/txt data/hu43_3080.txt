 Which halo books would you recommend??
 Originally Posted by Rhyme B Read them all, there's seven of the individual novels which are really interesting. The first is 'Halo: The Fall of Reach'.

All in all they are really good books so I would recommend you begin with the, as previously mentioned, 'Fall of Reach' book. Enjoy. Great! Thanks. When I'm done with my James bond books I'll check em out.
