 [WINNER: RAFFEE] MS Paint Someone a Valentine's Card
 It's straight forward really. We want you to use MS paint, or similar program to create a Valentine's Card for someone on A4. In the interest of funsies, it HAS to be an A4 member. If you don't have MS paint, you can use something like this: http://www.onemotion.com/flash/sketch-paint/ and save to your computer. Then upload to photobucket or similar. I will not accept perfectly photoshopped creations. Must be paint.The idea here is what you can do with the tools given.It doesn't have to be a masterpieceand I will be giving merit to those that can make us laugh. I have a 48hr Crunchyroll Pass that I will PM to the winner of this contest. Closing date 12th February 
 Do you RP, or are you interested in learning? Join our Role Player's Society here on A4. Would you like a baseball bat to shove up your ass along with that stick? You're a mod, please act like one A4 is on FACEBOOK
