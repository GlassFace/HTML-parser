 Vegeta vs Hulk!

Where people say vegeta could not destroy planets, I seem to recall the final flash move he trained in the time chamber and then used against cell threatened to destroy the planet. Likewise with goku's IT kamehameha. They only didn't because they were directed away. I think we can assume that in the buu saga both goku and vegeta are more powerfull. Also, battle of the gods is canon, and when angered vegeta lays some hurt on the god of destruction. judging by the clip at the end before beerus sleeps, he can destroy things (planets) easier than anything in a comic book so if hulk punched bulma in the ovaries, vegeta would probably beat hulk senseless Likening one character to another and A>B, B>C, therefore A>C arguments don't work in this sort of context. This context being one where we use empirical evidence and data to decide if one cartoon could beat another cartoon. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
