 Do you still buy physical books or just ebooks? Or none?
 Do you buy actual books or just ebooks? I just buy used books at garage sales mostly. I did buy a few James bond ebooks when amazon had a sale awhile back. Still haven't gotten to them yet. How about you? Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 I buy both, though I read nonfiction almost exclusively so it's not unusual for a book I want to only exist in print.

 Depends on what you wind up reading most. The last book I read was Scoundrels about 6 months ago. Before that was A Game of Groans about a year ago (highly recommend this one for Game of Thrones fans, and no, don't let your kids read it). What I normally wind up reading, though, are the rules for games. Yes, many are available on-line but I usually wind up reading the print version as it came with the game. I prefer the manuals in print form, though, as for some games you need it out on the table in order to set up the game (try setting up Merchants of Venus or Battlestar Galactica without the manuals and see you far you get).

 I usually go for the physical print cause I lose attention pretty quickly while reading ebooks.

 Ebooks can't replicate the feeling of a book in your hands or the turning of the page. I also take pride in my physical collection of books which isn't the same as a list of books on a tablet or PC. I do buy Ebooks sometimes if its relatively cheaper than a physical copy or getting my hands on a physical copy is just too much of a challenge.

 Books all the way. ebooks are like steam games for me. Seem like an awesome idea at the time aaaaaand they're forgotten. Plus its called google books. Sh1tloadfs of awesome lit for freez. I did enjoy my kindle when I had it a lot more than I'd thought I would. Looking up meanings of words when reading Cormac McCarthy at touch of button was a godsend. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Although I like to buy books some are too expensive so I usually read online. I mean what's the point of buying books when you an read for free?

 Usually physical. I cant see myself reading books on my computer, even though Im almost always on it. It's true that reading somethign without the printed copy in your hands with pages and all, it isnt the same. But sometimes it can get spendy.... ;( Another plus though, when people see me reading a book they often assume Im smart even though Im not

 I prefer actual books just because I love the feel and smell of a real book. However, there are some few authors who only publish through e-books. Very few that I know of, but yeah in that case I would get the e-book.

I also like the sensation of holding and real books. Though I'm not anti technology it's just like others I don't seem to have the same focus reading a digital version of something. 
 It really depends on my proximity to a book store. Most of my books that I read often are physical books because they won't break like my kindles keep doing, and because I tend to buy books I know I'll reread when I'm near a book store, which is almost never. Otherwise, it's ebooks(usually free ones) because they are easier for me to read for long periods and get on my phone.

I'm using a generic hard case for my nexus7. The one I'm using folds over and turns into a neat stand. Also what about the invisishield to protect against scratching? I bought one for my nexus but I haven't put it on yet. You do mean physical breaks not software crashes right? Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 I do both. My dream is to have a big house with an immense library when I get old

 I've grown up loving the feeling of an actual book, shuffling through the pages and having it warm up after a long period of holding it. I've never really liked ebooks - they are an awkward format for me to read and I only enjoy reading ebooks when I'm lying on my back/side in bed. I only use ebooks as a backup for my physical copy if I have a novel study for English. 
 
 I translate rather old (for lack of a better word) texts into English, German & Dutch (among other languages); which means I am required to purchase them (primarily from collectors, antique stores, etc...). Although, if your question were to be rephrased as "what format do you get most of your books in"? I would say that I periodically go to every local library & empty their throw-away bins, while occasionally buying eBooks on my Paperwhite. So physical > digital, in terms of quantity.

Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk Physical breaks, yes. The actual screen doesn't break, but rather the sort of inner area that has the actual image breaks, even in a case. Usually with a fall of more than a foot or more than soft pressure. I only had those problems with the keyboard kindles, but the one that is entirely screen has done fine. All of them have had cases with hard insides and soft outsides.

 @altozicity - wow that's surprising. How many did you go through? Do you have the new paper light one or whatever they call the newest one? Or did you step up to a full fledged kindle? I would have gotten a kindle fire hdx since its faster than the nexus 7 by a little bit. However I wanted the Google play store without rooting it. I don't regret getting the nexus 7 at all. Its played all my video files and I can use any app on the play store without any annoying "your device is incompatible" messages. Plus I was able to upgrade to android kitkat right out of the box just by clicking the update button. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 I prefer reading from an actual book

 I buy books from bookstores or borrow them from libraries, but at times when I can't find a book I want, I would read it online on my computer. Though reading an actual book is more enjoyable for me than reading it on a computer.

 Both. I still prefer a book. Also, has to be on a eink reader. I can't stand to read on a backlit screen. 
 I don't buy ebooks, since I have nothing to read them on. If I wanted to hold something to read, I'd just get a book, which is what I tend to do -- if there's not an audiobook version, anyway. Audiobooks are my preferred method of "reading," with physical books ranked behind it. I'm too lazy to read books either way, though. I've got a bunch of books on my iPod still waiting to be listened to, and even more, physical books, on my shelf collecting dust.

 Audiobooks are nice, but they get on my nerves because it reads in snails pace. Takes forever to read something and I'd rather just read on my own pace. Physical copies only but ebooks can save space if you're traveling or whatever. 
 I still like having the physical book in hand for reading, but ebooks are a nice alternative if I don't feel like bringing the physical book (doctor's office).

 I just found a book I have to buy. There is a new to me book in the great X Wing Star Wars book series. It's the 10th overall. I've read the series twice and can't get enough of it. I don't have it anymore but I'd love to start a new book in it. It came out in 2012 but only just found out about it. Fortunately I still have a barnesandnoble store nearby so I might actually be able to buy it at a store. Since it's not a brand new release the other big box stores probably won't carry it if its not a current best seller. Hopefully they have it otherwise I'll have to order it online and wait for it. 
 I love e-books. They give me an excuse to use my tablet (not to mention, Googling anything instantly from whatever I'm reading). Super easy to find/buy/download. I like lying in the dark on my bed with the back-lit screen, too. No more paper cuts on my pretty fingers 
I preserve my sexy, and I'm packin' heat, so don't disrespect me.
