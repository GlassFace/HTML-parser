[Event] 1st Annual: A4's Greatest Anti-hero vs. A4's Greatest Villain
 1st Annual A4's Greatest Anti-hero vs. A4's Greatest Villain View before reading any further:  Spoiler Now that the tone has been set with that piece; what’s all of this you ask? Well, it’s the first annual anti-hero/villain contest here on A4. Kinda got tired of the traditional spoils, and decided to make a new one. Most of the title is pretty self –explanatory. Who’s the biggest badass villain-like person here? Both intentionally and non-intentionally. And.. who’s that anti-hero-like person that comes in to defuse or not defuse things, depending on their appetite and mood for the day? All questions to consider when submitting your own entry, as well as nominating others. How to enter: It’s simple. Enter yourself here by username, with the category you want to be filed under. So for example, for myself I’d put: Demon Eyes Kyo [Villain]. Oh, and for those looking to duck and dodge such an event, nominations for either category are totally legit as well. So if you’re not quite interested in entering yourself, throw someone else’s name under the bus and see where it all lands. Who’s Eligible? Anyone, and everyone (barring admins; but mods are free to get into the mix). As for members that are really-really new, they’re welcome to sign up as well. However, there is a limitation here. From the day this nomination thread goes up, anyone who registers for A4 after that date, will not be eligible to enter, nor to nominate. Rules? Yes. Fortunately, and unfortunately for you, there will be a rule standard in place. 1. Only one entry for either category. The same person can’t be nominated for BOTH categories. And if by some chance it happens, through someone ninja’ing a post, the judges will convene with the nominee and make the final call. 2. Polling will be worth 60 points. The judging panel weighs in on the other 40 points. 3. The entry deadline is a week from today. So, 7 days to get your **** together and nominate. Extensions can be made, depending on the severity of the circumstance. (There are exceptions if technical problems on the user’s end hamper their ability to enter). 4. After the nominations and entries are firmly in place; it’s time to campaign. No holds barred on this one. Solicitation is encouraged. Slander your opponents, and spread rumors. However, death threats are not encouraged, or allowed. VM and PM people for votes if you want. Pull no punches with this one. 5. I deem this one the “Mihstah Clause.” If for some reason Mihstah is nominated, or through some weird stroke of sanity, enters himself; he is forbidden from soliciting votes through PM. VM solicitation is allowed, but PMs are means for an immediate disqualification. This rule needs no elaboration, he knows, and everyone on A4 knows why this clause is going to be in place. 6. [Edited and revised 8/19/14] : You can nominate whomever you like. Names are bound to repeat throughout this nomination process. But in essence, this becomes a 'voting' process in itself. If the total of nominations of an individual for anti-hero outweigh those who have nominated them for villain; then that person will be placed in the anti-hero pool. What’s the prize? A personalized award graphic signature; either villain or anti-hero. I was going to go with some anime theme or something, but it runs the risk that some members just may not know who the hell the character on the award is from, let alone the name of the show. So I’m going the way of the archetype anti-hero and villain; Batman and The Joker. Everyone knows who they are (at least you hope so). So that’ll be your template to get going. So either run a campaign to be the maniacal, psychopathic genius Joker. Or, the intelligent, brooding Dark Knight type of person, with all that entails the title, but unfortunately none of the billions Mr. Wayne has at his disposal. Bribe and coerce to your heart’s content. Think you have what it takes then? Think you’re badass enough to take on the others? Think you’re the stoic, stealthy anti-hero who only does the minimal amount of ‘good’ when it benefits him/her? Well, you have to win the title first, then you can brag about it later. Mock those who lose. Give a middle finger to the establishment by wiping your ass with said award and title. Or ego stroke yourself with this one. I don't care. Nomination run-time: 8/18/14 – 8/25/14. DISCLAIMER FOR POTENTIAL CONTESTANTS: Are you prone to crying fits? Prone to tantrum throwing? Prone to *****ing, moaning, whinging, and believe the world isn’t fair? Then you need not apply.

Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Yeah, looks like I edited my original post too late. You're free to nominate two people for each category. If it's limitless, there'll be a shitload of 1 vs. 1 threads that follow. Can you narrow it down to two each? 
Individual Eleven: Rise Up. Never conform. 
 No, not really. Maybe try running an event you can stay on top of? But seriously, just total up the noms and have about 2-4 for each.

Nah, I could handle the volume, but then this contest would be heading far into 2016. All right, I'll cherry pick your first two choices for each then. @Yoda313 - Zoltor? That's a sin. Nominate away.

 @demon eyes - hey I was nominated as a villain! That's a tragedy!!!!! And nothing against zoltor, were buds after all. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 Anti-Hero: Wuhdever Villain: Elfa 
 One choice for each category otherwise your first choice is all that counts. Up to you if you want to narrow it down or it just gets done for you, perhaps the first one that hasn't been nominated yet 

 Struggz would be my anti-hero. I don't care which one of my villains were chosen. They're all equally atrocious. 
 8/21/13 Never Forget 
 Well soyuza and mihstah have respectively been voted in many times, fondless is a good choice but irrelevant now... guess we have a winner with kayla dono lol 

 This forum needs more villains. 
 8/21/13 Never Forget 
 *kicks arch in the shins* That help? 

 Only if you were wearing a flamboyant costume while doing it. ;D

 All right, it's been updated accordingly. If an overwhelming amount of individuals nominate a certain person for a category, then the list may be re-calibrated accordingly. ONLY, if those who have yet to submit their nominations/entries by the 7th day deadline. 
Individual Eleven: Rise Up. Never conform. 
 Anti-hero - Myself (of course) and Oh Snap. F**k everybody else. Villian - Shannon Apple, Shian, Ian, and Kt. Why? Cuz I aint scurred. 
  Spoiler VIDEO GAME: Pokemon Black, Silent Hill 3, Yoshis's Island 2 ANIME:Chaos Head, Heaven's Lost Property, City Hunter, Aquarion Evol MANGA:Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tale, Toriko, One Piece 
 I've come to a conclusion. The persons who receive the most nominations for either category, that's the category they're going to be placed into. So for example, if Snap or Struggler get more nominations for anti-hero more so than villain; they they'll be put into the former category. So expect the nomination list in the OP change everyday throughout the week, until this shuts down next Monday. Makes it easier for me, and everyone else. So keep throwing out names, as I'm sure many are bound to be repeated. 
Individual Eleven: Rise Up. Never conform. 
 Villain: Ta-Ka, Dunn x Dolo Anti-hero: Green Bird, Captain Picard
