Due to the constant workouts and cardiovascular exercise his asthma improved. Not fully healed. Improved. He found himself being able to tolerate Fitness class a lot more without his asthma dominating him, this was in like the 11th grade so I don't know if his has improved further or gradually weakened again. Anyway all in all regardless of whether it had a unique effect on him personally or if exercise actually helps reduce asthma in general, working out and fitness is essential to keeping healthy so try your best! :3 In my case, going back to the OP, I actually workout frequently when I have spare time which has overall helped improve my stamina greatly. I've found I can progressively continue running for over 15 minutes without starting to get worn out. It's not as if I was unhealthy before I started Kung Fu and Karate, I was just really weak.
