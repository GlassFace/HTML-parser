 An Anime I watched many years ago...

In one of the ep, all of them find them selves at the gate way to some ruins. I can't remember for sure, if any of the scenes with that villain in it, has a storm going on, but there are storms in this anime, so It's likely. The Mysterious Cities of Gold Hearing the theme song jogged my memory of this series, so perhaps it will do the same for you as well. Here's the 30 years tribute video, which at the end the theme played. This is the one that I watched, that made me remember: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmMxBOqhyco and here's the pure OP video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ki99YBVKyw Yes. I think u nailed it (:
