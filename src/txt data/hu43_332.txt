 People like that aren't permabanned because Riot doesn't personally review your behavior until you've been suspended like 8 (or so?) times, and would rather delegate the task of managing misconduct to 13 year old boys who spam punish on the Tribunal.

And those 13 year olds are too fat and slow to catch that baller-as-**** Rammus

 Buddy Lee is an expert on the inner workings of the Tribunal as he has been there many times before.

 League of Pick Shyvana or Lose. It's pretty annoying playing against her. 
 Shyvana's good but not that good... It's pretty easy to beat shyv if you can play against her right. I just use my smurf account: Gethyon And my favorite champ is probably Kha or Kassadin, although Nasus top/jung is definitely my best.

 Anyone think she might be a bit less powerful if they changed her abilities to do physical rather than magic damage? Since she does so much of both its hard to itemize against her I think 

 Anyone experiencing client crash after a game? It didn't happen the other night, but just started going crazy this last one. 

 Idk, I haven't played for a couple days. 

 Only thing I been suffering is from a huge case of f-ed up supports. Teemo support, Vicktor support, Sion Support. Oh and I had a game with a Nidalee Adc, and Varus was her support. Wtf.

Oh and I had a game with a Nidalee Adc, and Varus was her support. Wtf. Ahh no you just have to play well to make an odd support work. I've gone bot lane 3 times in a row and won each time. Once with a Sion support (me on Jinx), a J4 support (me jinx again) and one where I played Pantheon (with a Karma support). Only won the last game though, but absolutely stomped the lane each time.
