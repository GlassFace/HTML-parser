[Extended Discussion] EXTENDED DISCUSSION PREFIX (Read before posting)
 Newer members (since 2012), please read this thread post 1 and 2. Too many misuses of the extended prefix. It is for debate topics. EXTENDED = debate/more in-depth discussion for people who like to discuss intelligent topics in more detail PERSONAL = Topics about real life GENERAL = Everything else
