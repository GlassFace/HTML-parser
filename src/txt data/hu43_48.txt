 Dreamweaver
 I still want to set fire to adobe for discontinuing the HomeSite (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomeSite) franchise when they bought Macromedia. Homesite was an awesome program for coding for the web. IMHO, Dreamweaver is annoying and only in the way. It is also -useless- if you try to do dynamic homepages (php/asp/whatever) which is much of everything on the web nowadays. Make sure you know how to do things without dreamweaver. Never do anything in dreamweaver that you do not know how to do by hand. Dreamweaver is the calculator, x/html/css is the math. Don't "trust" a tool to do something for you that you don't know how to fix if the tool does it wrong.
