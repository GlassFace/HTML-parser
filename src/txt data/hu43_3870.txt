 "New" 3ds xl to be released Feb 13th in Canada
 I assume it's the same date for all of north America as well. At EB games (Game stop in the US) u can trade in ur old 3ds for 80$ and ur old 3ds xl for 100 towards the new console. Starting at $229 Canadian so probably like 200 US Main additions: 1. Extra thumb stick 2. More powerful hardware will be able to play games like xenoblade chronicles... 3. Some games will be exclusive to the console.
