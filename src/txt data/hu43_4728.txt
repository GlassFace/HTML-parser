 Spider-Man Finally Joins the MCU - Page 2
 HAHA YES! YES! FINALLY! SUCK IT DC! WHERE'S YOUR MAN OF STEEL NOW?! Ahem. Sorry. YES! It's finally happening! LOL God, I'm clearly freaking excited about this. Hopefully, he would appear in an end-credits scene at the end of Avengers 2, but realistically speaking, I'm with Jeremy about him appearing only in Infinity Gauntlet - as much as I want him to appear in Civil War! Oh god. It's like the prodigal son returning. Welcome home, web-head. It's great to have you back. And yes, I know that Captain Marvel and Black Panther are being pushed back for Marvel's #1 cash-cow. Honestly speaking, I was kinda interested in Black Panther, and a mildly intrigued by Captain Marvel as well (though Wonder Woman is obviously more interesting as a feminist superheroine), but you know... it's Spidey, man. It's Spidey returning to Marvel. And as one of the web-slinger's biggest fans, I just... can't get that depressed about those two other movies being pushed back, nor about the fact that Andrew Garfield not playing him anymore. His portrayal was too hipster for my taste anyway, even if it's arguably better than Maguire's portrayal. That being said, I'm not that hot about the speculation that the new Spidey might be Miles Morales, because... eh, I like Peter, I grew up with him. *shrugs* So anyway, what do you think? Which movie do you think Spidey might appear in? Leave a comment below. Damn, I'm excited.
