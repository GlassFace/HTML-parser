[Sports] 2014 NCAA Tournament - March Madness
 I have to admit March Madness is really just cheap thrills for lousy fans. That being said I love it and watch as much as possible. To be honest I think without March Madness (64 team brackets+) a lot of fans wouldn't even watch regular games. Everything is based on this one tournament and all the stars have their chance to shine. Love those Cinderellas (dayton/mercer). Also, huge UK fan. Gonna give Witchata their first loss tomorrow!
