 Jurassic World

Sure, he's just a generic invincible zombie with a hockey mask and a machete... but he is the one and only invincible zombie with a hockey mask and a machete. I'm just saying, he became a pretty iconic horror icon in pop culture, whether the movies are actually acceptable within critic standards or not. I guess you can say it's kinda hypocritical of me to accept Jason and not the string of mediocre movie icons we get today. I guess it's just that Jason was pretty memorable for me as an icon, whereas there are a dozen copies of what Jurassic World is trying to do today. If this came out back in the heyday, maybe it might have came off as fresh. Who knows. With art, whether a movie feels original or not, whether if a story seems interesting or entertaining or not, are all matters of subjective opinion. I know people who finds The Godfather to be a bore. And then there's the matter of whether personal perspectives throughout our individual lives would affect the level of standards we have for each art piece. I hate it when people have objective standards for movies, anime, or just about any kind of art form. My views about Jurassic World, for example, are just a subject of my own opinion. We all have our own different feelings about how art affects us in different ways, even if logically, some art pieces should not do so due to 'camera angles' and 'poor pacing in the script'. Art and logic hardly go hand in hand very often.
