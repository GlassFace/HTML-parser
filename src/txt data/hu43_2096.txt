[Slice of Life] SoniAni -Super Sonico the Animation
 Super Sonico is an 18-year old college student who plays guitar for the three-girl band Fastest Speed in Space and models for pin-ups. In spite of her busy schedule, she still finds time to her grandmother at her restaurant. One night, her band members Suzu and Fuuri, are late to a concert, forcing her to play alone. The result of that show will have far-reaching consequences for Sonico.

 I just finished watching episode one and noticed there was no Thread made so yeah I stepped up haha. But I enjoyed episode one. Sonico is a cool character but not as cool as her manager haha. 

 Haha, I thought for sure there was a thread for this but I guess not. xD I haven't had the chance to watch the first episode yet, but I've got it ready, lol. PS, you'll need to find a new image for the first post as the ANN one is showing up as "No hotlinking".

 Aw man this last episode was really emotional. Tomano Senpai is AWESOME!!!! That end was brilliant and I hope she comes back in future episodes. 

 I've seen 3 episodes and I have to say, they are fairly enjoyable. And while I like Sonico, her manager is probably my favorite character. 
 Irrelevant slice of life episode lol 

 Isn't the protagonist a vocaloid? O__O If so, awesomeee.
