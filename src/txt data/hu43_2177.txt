[Personal Life Discussions] Have you ever met a person in real life you that you knew from a forum or online game
 I haven't. The closest I got was I did actually speak to one forum member over skype one time. Nothing really exciting or anything. Though I do remember it because I'm in the US and he's Australian so hearing a different accent is always intriguing. Especially since you don't get that localization with just text, other than some local slang that might not be obvious at first glance. How about you? Or have you gone on dates or even married after meeting online? 
 I may be meeting someone soon in the next few weeks, but whether or not that meeting will actually occur remains to be seen. Other than that, I did date a girl I met online some time back. But she moved away after a month and a half. And before her, I met another girl whom I wished to date, but she got back with her ex instead. So, I have met a few people from online. Only seems to be for a short time, though. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OPossum | Homestuck
 @lord darkton - had you exchanged pictures before you met?

 Yes. An online friend I met at Unichat ages ago. She made a visit to Toronto when she had a conference in Quebec City. Did some traveling afterwards and came to visit for a few days. A girl I met on another forum. We met up a couple of times. 
 Not yet, but I'll be hooking up with an A4 member soonish whereby I'll be brutally murdered and my body parts consumed. Its gonna be well kawaii. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro?

 Yeah I've met a bunch of A4ers, a bunch of peeps from an MMO called Puzzle Pirates, and some other online acquaintances in real life! Only regret meeting two of them out of dozens. 

 Met up with some dudes back in the day from an old America's Army clan. Most of them were pretty cool. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 I've met one person who happened to come out to Sydney from the UK. Old friend that I talked to occasionally on the EA games forums. Basically just had a lunch and walked around Sydney while she waited for her sister to finish work so they could head off elsewhere.

 Thanks for the replies. Nice to know you can meet total strangers and not have it turn into something horrible. 
 I've met plenty of people that I've only known online, one of them is like my super besty now. its pretty rad. You just have to be careful, and use common sense, public places, no booze, lots of boundaries all that lol As for A4, I've met Kidanarchy, and we hang out fairly often considering the distance, we even went white water kyacking this summer! It was super fun =3 I've also met Quul a couple times, but I'm pretty sure she thinks my husband is a dick, so I can't say things went super well XD 
 Both Thanks to Sl33py =3 My Tumblr Click me and feed some needy shelter animals, for FREE! 
 Le playing Extinction last night, Hear kid talking, ask if hes from Pennsylvania because he sounds like my cousins, got it right, thats the closest Ive gotten XXD 
 Yup! I've met 3 people from A4, and about 150+ from the other forum I frequent. I've met B00B (Morgan,) Pinky, Gan/Lif (Who isn't my friend anymore because he's a misogynist *******,) and Kidanarchy (who doesn't really come on here anymore.) With the other forum I go to; every year we would set up a giant party in either the east or west coast. We'd call it "Bootycon" (A joke play on word of the website, which gives you a hint to the forums name I guess!) Last year we met up in Chicago, the year before that was LA, and the year before that (my first huge meetup) was Atlantic City NJ! I also hung out with a crap ton of them at Magfest 12, about a month ago. I don't really have any group pics for Chicago. I only have pics of me pathetically hungover from that trip. Anyways, Here's some pics! Atlantic City, 2011  Spoiler LA, Disneyland (Only a few of us trekked out to Disneyland, everyone else did their own thing back at the hotel we were all staying at (we'd rent out blocks at a time for rooms.) So, there are a lot more that were in LA with us than pictured here.  Spoiler Magfest 12 (2014)  Spoiler It's pretty fun!

 8/6/12 Never Forget. T.O.B RIP Gwenny 4/30/13. I love you.
 I have met a few Europeans from another site, yes. However it was more of a chance meeting where they were coming here anyway and we arranged to meet up. 
 Do you RP, or are you interested in learning? Join our Role Player's Society here on A4. Would you like a baseball bat to shove up your ass along with that stick? You're a mod, please act like one A4 is on FACEBOOK
 Nope.Not a single time.And I doubt that it will ever happen. 

 met a dozen of people like that. And most of them were totally ok, cool, normal dudes who weren't "socially inappropriate". But then again there is always a couple of stereotypical loosers. Not to mention those were the "loudest" guys on the forums. One guy was like the ultimate troller, who dared to take a sh** on everyone and everything. Then his friend showed us a picture of him. After realizing his Napoleon complex, we kinda let him be our forum bully 
 I have not;however, there are a few people on these forums I would like to meet one day. Oh Snap, Zer0, Ian, Strugs, Pured, and Black Templar.

 I met this guy called 'BloodyAzzy' on League/Dragon Nest in real life, this year. He came to my suburb after I finished school o 3o It was a guild meet up and we just went out for a movie and lunch. So yeah. Nothing much really.

 I haven't, though not for any real reason aside from the fact that virtually no one I've met here or elsewhere lives in this part of the country. There are only two people I know of from A4 that live even remotely close, and they're still two states away. Most people I've spoken to that live in NA seem to live on one side of the continent or the other, while I'm almost dead center in the middle. Oh well, such is the way of internet socializing. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 On other sites I have met a few of the people there. On this site no, but a few of the members The only ppl close to me right now on this site is Zero, and Chicanary. Im pretty sure one day we will meet up at some convention they have here in Philly. Zero will probably be drunk off his a$$ and Chica will be trying to make me eat some dayum Special Cream of Wheat that she made. -_-

 I have not, but I sure wish I have. I've exchanged snail mails, pictures, and gifts, but never got the chance to meet my online friends in person since they tend to live in a different continent, far far away from mine. Maybe someday I'll get to meet them, hopefully. 

 I've exchanged awkward eye contact with Zer0 on more than one occasion. I usually walk into the nearest house when I see him walking down my street, his long mane flowing behind him. I think I can confuse his superhuman sense of smell by leaving my scent in all the houses on my block. He'll never know which one is mine. Other than that, nope. I talk on Skype with a few people and have a few Facebooks but everyone seems to live lightyears away.
