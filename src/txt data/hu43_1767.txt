 Best mods around?
 I'm talking about gaming mods, not A4 mods just to be clear. What are some of the best mods you've played? I have a few FFVII Advent Children mod  Spoiler GTA Vice City Back to the Future mod  Spoiler Left4Dead San Andreas  Spoiler 

 Counterstrike (HalfLife) Project Reality (BattleField2) Napoleonic Wars (Mount and Blade Warband) Natural Selection (HalfLife) Killing Floor (Unreal2k4) Insurgency (HalfLife2) ZombiePanic (HalfLife/2) ZombieMaster (HalfLife2) Red Orchestra (Unreal2k4) NeoTokyo (HalfLife2) The Haunted (Unreal2k4) The Hidden Source (HalfLife2) Many of these are their own fully fledged games now, some of which made the transition better than others... 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 Does Gary's mod for counter strike count? I've never played counterstrike, but I watch videos and some of the game modes just look so fun. I like the one where you pick an object e.g. a tin or a boot, run around and the other team has to shoot you.
