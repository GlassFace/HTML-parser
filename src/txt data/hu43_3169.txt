[Fantasy] Juuou Mujin no Fafnir
 With the sudden appearance of the monsters that came to be called Dragons, the world had completely changed. Before long, within the human race supernatural girls with the power of the dragons, called "D," were born. The secret existence of the only male "D," the boy Mononobe Yuu, was forcefully thrown into the school where the girls of "D" gatheredMidgar, where he saw the naked body of one of the students, Iris. Furthermore, meeting his long-lost sister Mitsuki, Yuu seems to have been enrolled into this school...?! "When there's really no other choice, Iris, I willkill you." "Can I really... believe you?" The curtains open as the "one and only story" about the boy who was supposed to become the strongest assassin and the incompetent girl unfolds! Unlimited School Battle Action! Coming for the 2015 winter season starting in January!

 I liked the first episode. Though the Iris girl is annoying already. 
  Spoiler "If the king does not lead, how can he expect his subordinates to follow?"
 I like it. It is kinda different...kinda. But I like the MC and I like these chicks. 

 Si Iris is not only annoying, but annoyingly clingy... Loved the principal! The new girl is soo kawaii! She is now my favorite just like Mitsuki.

 I'm digging this show. New Pink hair is annoying but Iris is growing on me. I need more of Pig Tails with glasses...woof 

 Episode 5 was a disappointment, there were points I was like "WTF is happening?" The preview for episode 6 they pretty much spoil who the Dragon is. I thought it was Honoka and my prediction might still hold the only difference was the eyes. 

 The headmaster is officially my favorite character in this series.

 Loli cutness power!! Why do I think that Kili person will be that girl with glasses?? Iris is still being annoying. Mitsuki is awesome!

Honoka was my prediction being Kili I mean they both have long black hair, the only difference was the eyes but I figure they change color once the dragon powers awaken.
