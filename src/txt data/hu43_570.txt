 [PLEASE NOTE] Genre Prefixes
 Hey guys, We've implemented prefixes in this subforum for your convenience. When posting a new thread, choose the genre that best suits it from the dropdown menu. It will make it much easier for everyone to find information on the type of anime that interests them right away. (If you want to add one to a thread that you've already posted, you should be able to by going to "edit", then "go advanced" and choose the correct one from the dropdown menu on the top left.) BTW: If you double click on a genre prefix in the forum (for example "romance") it will seperate all threads with that prefix out. It's kinda cool.
