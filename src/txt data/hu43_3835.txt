 Yotsuba, All Grown Up
 I'm a huge fan of Kiyohiko Azuma's "Yotsuba&! and was curious how other fan's of the series would respond if Azuma took the story of Yotsuba in the same direction that Yumi Unita did with Usagi Drop. The series is relatively stable, and readers of Yotsuba already know sort of what to expect with the series. Being a predictable manga doesn't necessarily take away from the story's appeal, but I'm just curious how the story would be if it jumped 10 years into the future. What do you think? Would this be something you'd like to see, or no? I, personally, would love to see a spin-off manga.
