 Bleach 573
 Kenpachi coming back to kick some ass. Unohana's death is confirmed for all the nay-sayers. Gremmy's power, "The Visionary", allows him to manifest his imagination as reality and makes his body harder than steel, but Kenpachi still cuts him. With the honor of "Kenpachi" on the line, Zaraki is gonna make this one hell of a show.
