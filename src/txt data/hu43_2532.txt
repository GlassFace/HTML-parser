[Mecha] Aldnoah.Zero
 I'm really loving this season so far, I just marathoned the first six episodes of season two earlier. The OST for this season is really wonderful, I find myself enthralled in some of the scenes due to its spectacular music. I'm really hating and loving Gen Urobuchi right now, he's weaved this dramatic Sci-Fi plotline, and I'm always wondering when someone's going to die or how something's going to go bad as I watch. It's SO THRILLING. 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils? Join Super-Powered and get in on the action! Â Spoiler http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...-Super-Powered
