[Anime] Do you get the same satisfaction when you marathon a show as you do going slower?
 I just watched Yuki yuna is hero in basically one sitting. Ive never really done that and its a twelve show season. I actually didn't enjoy the experience as much as I thought I would. It kind of felt like a mission. I just had to get to the next show. It wasn't exactly that gripping of a show. Its just that I felt the need to complete it in one go. But I kind of feel empty after doing that. I've done four or five shows at a time before of course. But then I can look forward to the next batch of shows. By doing one season all together I didnt get to experience that bit of wonder and anticipation you get by waiting between shows. Do you prefer to watch as many shows at once as possible? Or do you like to spread a series over multiple viewing sessions??
