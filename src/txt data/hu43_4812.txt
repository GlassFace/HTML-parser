[Anime] Space Mechs Fighting and Years lost
 Hi All, I was at Otakon a few years ago and remember seeing a really cool Anime movie. It was about the space mechs fighting aliens. I remember at the end they fell into the one zone where they lost time. By the time they got back to their home world 10,000 to 40,000 years has past. When they arrived the planet lit up and said welcome home. Anyone know the name of this anime?
