[General Discussion] Guys realtalk: The snow attacking New England is insane
 For the past few weeks or so, snow has been stacking up higher and higher in my neighborhood. My city is kinda in bad shape in some areas, and now we're in risk of having school in July. Things that's been pissing me off is people not shoveling their sidewalks and people not shoveling the sidewalks on some roads. You have to walk on the streets and if you live in Rhode Island it's like asking for a death wish. I like to know what it's like in your towns or states. 
 Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide. *Bill The Butcher - Gangs Of New York*
