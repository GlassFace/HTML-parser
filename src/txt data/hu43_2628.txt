 Question about Fullmetal Alchemist
 The first series has a better beginning and is written to explain things better. I also believe it has better scenes like when ed fights the lion and bird chimera at the start. That being said, Brotherhood has a much better storyline overall. It feels more thought out, feels like it gets into a proper depth of engagement, and concludes in a way that seems more uplifting and for-filled than the first series.
