 What are you currently Playing?
 How is sunset overdrive? I see your description but I was wondering: Is it like infamous? From what I've seen it seems like a light hearted version of the free roaming infamous. Though it'll be awhile before I get another game. I've got too many to go through right now. Actually... its exactly like Infamous, take that game, add tony hawk pro skater, boom.
