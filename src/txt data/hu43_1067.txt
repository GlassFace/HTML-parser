 [EVENT] New Site Banners for A4
 I think it's about time that we started taking submissions for a new banner rotation. Dimensions: are 1000 x 200 Format: Jpeg. - There is no point in uploading massive png files to the site as they take too long to load. Theme: Anime - preferably summer scenes and 2013 anime, but you can create banners on whatever shows that you want. Staff will choose the best 20 or so (more if we have a high standard) and they will all be put up in the next rotation. Deadline: May 30th 
 Do you RP, or are you interested in learning? Join our Role Player's Society here on A4. Would you like a baseball bat to shove up your ass along with that stick? You're a mod, please act like one A4 is on FACEBOOK
  Spoiler Too lazy to repost the other ones left in mod forums.

 Lol... After seeing those I won't even bother, really liking those banners and the fact they aren't league of legends. Shame some are from underaged porno but oh well they at least look good.

 If you're not going to enter any banners, don't post in the thread. BUT, I'd like to understand what you mean by this as well. I see nothing sexual about any of those banners. Please explain.

 Here is my measly pitiful attempt of a banner 
  Spoiler 
 Okay, back to photoshopping spree. And I have a question. Can I have two same entries with slight difference? The base picture and design is same, but the wording is different. Here's my submission, more is to come in the future.  Spoiler EDIT: Found some left. Made this a few days ago, and kinda rushed, so maybe it's not that good.  Spoiler

 I do not have photoshop or anything like that. My ability to do stuff is limited to only MS Paint. So here you go...not very good but whatever.  Spoiler

 I'll try making more/better ones. It's been awhile since I've done this. :/

 ^Your images are stretched. We don't use stretched images in our banner rotation, if you are using photoshop try to hold down shift when resizing your stock so it wont stretch left and right. - I'll whip up some banners when I have time, which is probably next week. 
 Credit to Token for the signature! poke him if you want one 8D Check out the Osu! and the Wallpaper Thread

 Shikinami definitely has the best ones.

I was planning to, but this thread was easier to find, and assumed these ones and the sweet sakura ones will be put in the same rotation? @Chunibyou, there is nothing about child porn that makes it a good banner. Apart from the 3rd last one... Didn't know it was child porn until I saw his others :s
