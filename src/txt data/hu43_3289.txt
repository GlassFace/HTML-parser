 World never fails to disappoint me.
 I am absolutely against this decision and all it brings, but blaming religion as a whole is just as foolhardy. You cannot lump everything into a neat, little package and say it is to blame for all the world's ills. Religion is not exactly a Pandora's Box. When you open it, it does not unleash all the evil into the pure, unmolested world. Yes, people have done horrific, vile acts in the name of religion. But remember, people have done horrible things in the name of science, in the name of themselves, in the name of their country, in the name of their family, you name it. Religion is like a mirror. It only reflects what a person is. Religion is just another aspect of humanity. Whether or not you like it, it is here to stay. It is ingrained into every culture imaginable and it cannot be so easily dispersed. I understand the frustration as I am too am upset at this, but blaming all religion is not helping. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
