 You can now buy a mech
 If I could sit in the cockpit while watching TV along with a bunch of popcorn right now, then I'd be happy. You don't have to be mecha to be one. You just need to smile and shoot down your enemies... with BB bullets. 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
