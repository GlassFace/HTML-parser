[Review] CastleCrashers review
 Gameplay: It's a fun arcade type game. If you played the Simpsons Arcade game, TMNT arcade game, and/or X-Men arcade game - then you know what I'm talking about. The controls are simple enough: Attack, Jump, Item, Magic. (I think there is one more.) Multiplayer: This is the reason to get/buy the game. It's a fun game to play with friends online or at home. You can compete with friends and/or work together to finish each stage. Visuals: It has a cartoony feel, but that is really what I think the developers were shooting for considering the whole basis and story. Music/Sound: Everything sounds great and doesn't get too repetitive after a minute or two. They're catchy and level appropriate. To me, nothing sounds out of place. Overall: Good. It's a fun game. But it's definitely buy worthy if you have many friends coming over and/or have a lot of online friends who buy/play the same type of games. I still play it from time to time to unlock all the characters and to have each character beat the game. Again, overall I give the game a "Good" rating.
