 BREAKING: Bored individual makes forum account while pondering life.
 Hello all. I'm not sure there's much to be said about me that would interest the average forum dweller, but ah well. I'm more-or-less you're average person, of average height and weight and gender. Anime is rather big hobby of mine, and I'm fortunate enough to have a job which can support such an expensive hobby. I also enjoy games, certain sports, subordinate clauses, and generally being alive. I did the forum thing a lot back in the mid-2000s. Met a lot of cool people and had a had a great time, but around 2008-2009 life started happening and I more or less quit and spent the following years full of fulfillment and social interaction in the real, outside world. Well, now it's the wee hours of the morning, and I'm sitting up thinking about Space Dandy, and I'm not really sure if I'm hoping to recapture some of the excitement and fun that came with being an angsty teenager on an Internet forum, or if I'm just bored and looking for a good way to kill a few hours. Regardless, I decided to dig out that old email address that, having been made back when I was 14, no one can ever know of and made my account here while I try to figure out that answer. In either case, to anyone who suffered through my rambling, nice to meet you. tl;dr: HAI GAIZ! 
 Hello and welcome abord ! I hope you find what you are looking for here...
