[Anime] Incredible anime crossovers
 So i recently so the toriko X one piece special and it made me wonder what o you think would be an awesome crossover. mine would be shaman king X KHR but those are my two favorite anime anyway. 
 I would prefer to see Black Lagoon x Jormungand or Amnesia x Uta no prince-sama my all time favorites.
