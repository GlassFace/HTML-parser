[Action] Akame ga KILL!

All our nightraid characters made their exits just fine imo. I was ready for the deaths cos they were already dropping dead one by one since the beginning anyway. Akame v esdeath was the coolest. Esdeath's love story could have ended differently! And the eye patch boss could have more actions too despite having lost susanoo. And I'm unhappy about tatsumi killed by that emperor.. Overall its a good series considering how far it deviates from manga.  Spoiler Tatsumi wasn't killed by that emperor.. Tatsumi chose to let himself die in place of those citizens.
