[Futuristic] Terra Formars
 Terra Formars (テラフォーマーズ) is a Japanese manga series written by Yū Sasuga and illustrated by Kenichi Tachibana. It is serialized in Shueisha's magazine Weekly Young Jump since 2011. Viz Media has licensed it for an English-language version in 2013. Two anime adaptions are planned to be released: a television series, covering the Annex 1 arc, and an original video animation (OVA), abroading the Bugs 2 arc. Also, a spin-off manga titled Terra For Police starts on May 10 in Jump Kai. In an attempt to colonize Mars, 21st century scientists were tasked with warming up the planet so that humans could survive on its surface. They came up with an efficient and cost effective plan of sending cockroaches and mold to the surface so that the mold would absorb the sunlight and purify the atmosphere, while feeding the insects whose corpses would help the mold spread throughout the planet. Five hundred years later, the first manned ship to Mars lands on the planet and the six crew members are attacked by giant mutated humanoid cockroaches with incredible physical strength later labeled as "Terraformars". The crew members are easily wiped out, but not before sending a transmission back to Earth. Decades later, a multinational expedition is sent to exterminate the mutated bugs and take control of the red planet only to be wiped out as well, except for two survivors who managed to return to Earth, with one of them swearing to one day return to Mars and avenge their fallen companions. As a third expedition is assembled, questions are raised about the true origin of the Terraformars and their connection with a mysterious disease that is afflicting mankind back on Earth. To fight the Terraformars' strength and agility, the members of the second and third expedition undergo genetic modification to inherit the characteristics of other organisms, only possible after having a special organ implanted inside their bodies with only a 30% chance of surviving the surgery.

 Omg Ned is back! Wow, this is so much more action paction than what I previously believed. These huge humanoid cockroaches are actually creepy...and the main characters are going to be brawling with these buggers?! Cool! I don't know how to feel about this series, it's so...masculine based off of the trailer. I expect every member of the cast to either die, get sexually assaulted, or commit suicide. 
 This show is rated under the "seinen" category (geared towards mature adults, not young boys like the shounen category). So yeah, your assessment sounds like it should be spot on, Shumser. 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 Why they go hand combat only when there should be advanced weapons at that time keeps me wondering. Anyway its a great action series. Thx for sharing. Looking forward to ep 1 
 I expect every member of the cast to either die, get sexually assaulted, or commit suicide. Well ****, Ned, I don't want major characters to die or get raped. 
 Episode 1 is aired now!

 I were watching it just now and stopped halfway due to the whole screen being censored in the bloody scenes. If you know a source that doesn't censor ridiculously much I'd appreciate if you tell me here or via PM. I don't want something as pity as censoring to kill my enjoyment of something that looks like a promising show. Otherwise I'll just have to buy the series when it is complete.

Unfortunately, the root source for all the newly aired episodes will be the Japanese television broadcast, and that's where the censorship is coming from. Changing the source you find it on the internet won't help. If you really want to watch it uncensored you will need to wait for the DVD release, which will be some time after the season has completed. Yeah, I'm worried there will be a lot of censorship on this one. D: First episode was awesome though! Hizamaru Akari... Sheila x Eva. <3 Michelle Davis...

 The illustrated animations reminds me a lot of Fuun Ishin Dai Shogun, and I ****ing adored that anime. I have to make time for this anime. 
 Yeah... this is an art style that comes from seinen manga, which Terra Formars is. We see so many shounen titles that this one is refreshing. 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 It haven't intrigued me after the first episode , but I will try few more just to be sure... Though the line '' The war between Humans and cockroaches '' did make me laugh... 
  Spoiler "If the king does not lead, how can he expect his subordinates to follow?"
 I think the whole advanced weaponry aspect of this is probably due to them being on Mars and not being able to test functionality of said weaponry in the Mars atmosphere due to the infection. I'd say brawling is the only way for now. Otherwise they wouldn't need a select few. Or the advanced weaponry that we think has happened is like the Back to the Future hover board we thought would exist by now. (Movie was set in 2012-ish)

 I don't understand the appeal of racist space bug anime at all. Especially not with the ridiculous censoring I've seen in screencaps. 

 Cant wait 2 watch it

 The idea seems like a joke.

 There's legitimately no reason to watch this until the uncensored BDs come out. The manga is better, and the entire point of the manga is a joke. It's got some "suffering", but it's not meant to be an entirely serious manga. They really screwed the pooch by censoring it to Hell, though. 

 Wow, Episode 4 totally caught me off guard and blew me away! I really cried. It looks like they're laying off the censorship now, too. This show has gotten so good! 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 Yeah I wasn't expecting that was the first to go. I mean, They're way too careless. Don't they know already their previous tech was stolen? Anyway, I'll enjoy the fights without thinking too much (:

I'm sure they didn't expect cockroaches to be able to analyze and reproduce the most advanced human technology! The roaches people are used to aren't that highly evolved! But wow, them feels.... T_T PS, Marco was pulling off limbs and decapitating roaches, then beating up with their own body parts. None of that was censored, so I think you guys can stop worrying and complaining about the censorship. :/

 Just... Trying to put a blame on captain leaving the ship too far. U know, can't handle the feels nicely... );

 Got all caught up myself with this and...I don't get why they are fighting them, if they are intelligent which we've seen there should be a way to communicate with them. Instead they regard them as insects and kill them, now we don't know about the first meeting of the two but this seems like a Columbus coming to the West Indies. Even though we're the ones who made them though a mistake, we should come to understand them instead of beating the ever living s*it out of them. My question is why they haven't visited that yet. Over all the show's decent but they don't cover something as basic as that. In this scenario we're the vermin.

 Yeah, the settings are not solid I should say. But I just take it as humans are too proud to coexist with them, or those higher ups people = roaches, whatever. I'm into this just for the action Their evolution into humanoids are questionable too considering the lack of predators, food abundance (lots of greenery n water) and lack of need to fight/self-defend on mars for ~500 years Wtf just watch it and don't think too much when it comes to this sort of story
