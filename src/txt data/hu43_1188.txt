[Action] Kill La Kill
 That article was just the views of the author, it's not necessarily over-all agreed fact. As for KlaK, it was definitely a silly parody and should be treated as such, while also respected for the extra work that went in to crafting the plot, the sound, and the animation itself. If you dropped it already, then there's not much I can do about it. I mean, as things picked up with the reveal of the secondary antagonist and the larger plotline, as well as more internal conflict with the protagonist - and you found that as "meh" then that heavily implies it really just isn't for you.
