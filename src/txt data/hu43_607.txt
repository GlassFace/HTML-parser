 Night Angel Trilogy was really good... the last one was pretty devastating though. For more quality stuff by Brent Weeks you should check out Lightbringer. It's one of my favorites and book by book it just keeps getting better. The third installment just came out and I'm a bit sad that the next one will be the last.
