[General Discussion] What is a Stereotypical British Person to you?
 Like the title says. Was reading this article ( http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/how-o...ource=vicefbuk ) Whether they're all true or not, Been an Englishman, I know some of these are true for the majority but not all. For Example, Their is definitely a drinking problem in Britain.. Wayyyyy to many people drink.. I personally don't. Granted I'm 17. But still I have no Interrest in it. My Friends drink, I don't, 1- don't like the taste, found a few I do like though.. 2 - See no point, most people drink to 'relax'. I watch anime.. Too Nationalistic.. ENGLAND IS THE BEST COUNTRY!! joking.. It isn't all that good... Decent history (Not the wars, but inventions and events like the Industrial Revolution) SOME good landscapes, Cities are okay... We have a Queen (Personally can't stand the royal family)... Racism is definitely, again I am not racist in any way.. Couldn't care if you Black, White, Christian, Jew, Muslim, Buddhist etc... Humans are Humans, some you will like some you won't... But yeah, This got me wondering.. What is a stereotypical Brit to you/where you are from?
