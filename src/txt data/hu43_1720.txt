[Manga] Manga Virgin
 Hello everyone, I am a manga virgin. I have never read a manga. So I figured why not start? Is there a place online where I can read it or do i actually have to buy the "books"? Also what do you suggest my first manga should be? P.s. please don't hate on me for being noob 

 Only two legal sites I know of off the top of my head are http://www.yenpress.com/yenplus/ and http://shonenjump.viz.com/wsja anything else is going to be an illegal scanlation site and disallowed from being mentioned by our forums rules. If you'd like some recommendations for stuff to check out, maybe you could tell us what you've enjoyed watching. From there, it's pretty simple to just google the title. 

 Berserk. Read Berserk. After you've done that you can move onto reading other things, and Berserk will be your standard for judging them...forever...and nothing will measure up. There are countless manga sites, but I don't know which, if any, are legal, and illegal ones can't be mentioned so you're better off just Googling "read ___ manga online" for whatever you want. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 Thanks for the information guys! I appreciate it! I will check out Berserk http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Kluxe Those are all of the anime I have seen, I will just google and find good rated slice of life/romance manga. Happy to take suggestions! 

 Am..I have never read One-punch man but I hear its awesome. And you should check out The Breaker. The Breaker isn't a manga because it comes from Korea so its a manhwa but its still the same concept.

 Oh try Ao No Exorcit! Its awesome {or so I hear} p.s I'm a manga virgin to ^-^" 
 Just make sure that your first time is a special one. Light some candles to set the mood, have a fancy diner, or take the manga for a walk in the park before reading it. On a more serious note, Berserk is awesome 

 Manga virgin good name to call people you never read manga before.But,definitely berserk like struggler said. 

 try Tower of God, its also a manhwa so it in color. it would be a good first read

 There's an app for iOS which is just called straight up "MangaReader". It's awesome, it has almost any manga you can think of and for free, plus you can download volumes within seconds so you can read them even without internet. If you wanna read on your computer, just google search the name of the manga you want followed by 'manga reader' and within the first few links you should find one. Personally, I prefer the books. I like being able to hold what I'm reading in my hand, but the iOS app is so simple and smooth that I'm starting to move away from my need.

 I tend to not read Action like Attack on Titan, Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail or One Piece. I enjoy reading Shoujo anime or Ecchi manga. But this is my preference, maybe you had find a different approach to reading manga.
