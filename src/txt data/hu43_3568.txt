 Vegeta vs Hulk!
 The question is who would win between hulk and vegeta. Basically a single battle. So Vegetas "Unlimited Power" wouldn't count here. If it was more than 1 battle then yeah probably vegeta, but a single battle at their current strongest? Maestro/World War Hulk vs. SS4 Vegeta. Hulk would own him hands down. Vegeta for some reason or another pretty much just loses if hes hit once from anybody other than Goku. Every villain that seemed to get a nice hit pretty much owned vegeta. Vegetas battle usually follow the same setup. Fight stars - Vegeta Gets Hit - Spazzes on Energy Shots - Vegeta Loses. ^_^ Win for the Hulk.
