 Brutal Legend
 This game was awesome. I finished it yesterday, and I'm easily going to replay it (after I've found all hidden items...) and go bash it out in multiplayer on xbox live. The story of this game is, imho, totally brutally awesomely legendary. Also, it features an ACTUAL ENDING, something that many games of today does not (Oh, you've finished the game? TO BE CONTINUED! Wait for the sequel...if there is one! Mwahahaha!). I actually feel like I've played an _entire_ game for once, instead of yet another oh-maybe-theres-a-sequel-so-we-leave-everything-open-and-give-you-no-closure-game. I actually felt like I _cared_ about the characters in this game, that doesn't happen often. About the 3rd person strategy. Yes, it was highly unexpected. But I welcome it. I've seen millions of the god-of-war-clones now, and it felt good that this wasn't just another one. The stage battles are somewhat weird at first, but once you get into it it's quite satisfying. The game also had a good pacing, presenting the concepts to you in chunks of the right size. I really honestly enjoyed this game. Do yourself a favour and don't overlook it just because the demo didn't show you the entire gameplay. If it had shown you the full blown stage battles, you would have been overwhelmed. It takes a while before you get a hang on those. This game was fun, had a great story, good gameplay and is not yet another clone of some other old game (like pretty much all games nowadays seems to be..). At least rent it, the story alone is worth it. For me though, this one's a keeper.
