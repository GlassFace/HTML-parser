[Comedy] Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. - Page 2
 Not sure what's with me but the past episode I wasn't all that into, what I mean by this is half my concentration was on something else for what ever reason, but yah, this episode was great, I love the emotionless girl singing and getting embarrassed by him showing up. And near the end the episode went crazy XD.

And near the end the episode went crazy XD. When she was wearing his shirt in the kitchen and singing I was laughing so hard. Like you can tell she was trying to show feelings but she just couldn't! But something I kinda disliked was he summoned Azuki so he could see her in her swimsuit and he knew he could send her back to Okinawa but he didn't...so what are the two friends she was with at the beach going to do??? lol something to think about. 

 Wow episode 7 was real emotional. So Yokodera has some past with the Tsutsukakushi family, which makes things interesting, and of course there was the end. I thought it was a great episode and I am looking forward to next week. 

 Someone wanna help me out with that ending? Like is the sister real or is she non existent, anyone have any ideas what the heck is going on? I'm glad they're introducing the Rabbit I knew it was somewhat evil from the opening. As for the episode I thought it was decent, one thing I did not like was the fact they they pretty much swept the Steel Kings kiss with Yokodera under the rug. When Tsukiko was on the bike she talks about how all the younger class-men hate him. Idk if it was because of the kiss or just because he's so close to the Steel king. Also when he was playing catch with the panties...I was laughing so hard. BUt EVERY week a cliff hanger. And with only 4 episodes left I do not know where this is going, all I know is that The Tsutsukakushi sisters are my favorite girls and I hope one of them win. 

 I'm going for the blond haired girl. That being said best fan service episode ever. Who wouldn't go to a school where that's the standard uniform. Also that new girl introduced came out of no where which is pretty bad considering how the plot has progressed so far. I thought she was an alto ego of the blond hair girl till the last part which would have made senses but then they added in that she is someone completely new. So lets see where this can go, a lot can happen in 4 episodes.

 Read the manga and saw one episode of the anime. All I can say is that the anime is substantially better and ****ING AMAZING ERMYGAWED. I'm gonna wait for it to finish airing then marathon it but yeah this series is just fantastic.

I am actually surprised that I want the "Obvious" one to win because usually I root for the underdogs haha. But yeah a strong amount of Fan Service in that episode made an already awesome episode even better. 

 Tsu-chan ftw!

 episode 8 was by far the funniest episode from this show so far. "Dynamite drill", "ecchi sketchy ouji ji !!" XD

 Well I guess that just happened in episode 9. At least they didn't leave the episode on a cliff hanger. And I guess it just proves that  Spoiler the cat god has Tsukiko's smile. Or that he gave it to Asusa after she wished to be different, either way I really do not know how they are going to wrap this show up in 3 more episodes, if it doesn't I would expect a season 2 Also am I the only one in the world who does and enjoys this dance during the credits? 

 I always watch the ending sequence, I love it. Good episode either way.

 My jaw seriously hit the floor after that episode...like what the hell is happening? This anime is so good, and next weeks episode looks hilarious. All I have to say is "Barbara-san, you're alive?" lol 

 ^ XD I loved that part, would have been just as funny if he didn't notice and began snuggling. I have a feeling time travel is involved with all of this, not them simply going to the past, but a lot of stuff is going to be explained now.

 Agreed looks like everything is going to wrap up, but Im hoping it doesnt and they have a second season in the works. 

 Well these are interesting developments. I love the emotionless girl's reactions to everything in this episode...but it's going to be interesting to see how the mom's stuff is going to go down.

 I'm pretty sure I had a heartattack when I saw little Azuki Azusa...so damn cute! Anyways, it looks like things are sorta clearing up about Tsukiko and Yokodera---sorta.

Anyways, it looks like things are sorta clearing up about Tsukiko and Yokodera---sorta. I had an heartattack and nose bleed when I saw Azuki, same with when the emotionless girl put young Yokodera under her shirt. No idea why she did that but I want that to happen to me...younger me XD. Also I knew time travel was involved in what is currently happening after they brought it up. Makes senses. I felt really sad when Steel pushed young Tsukiko back into the car so they can leave and she was crawling over the bench seat to see her mom.

Yeah that was brutal for me, I was like "NO, STEEL DON'T DO THAT LET HER SEE MOMMY!" Actually, her mom's really quite the cool character, I mean, how can you NOT like those "PJs"

"You have to grow up the same way you are now, not into a Hentai-san" I LOST IT!!! Hahaha Also Drunk Tsukiko had me rolling. But the end left it on a cliffhanger...even though we already know what happens to the mother... 

 Brought me to tears, both happy and sad. I really hope they make a season 2, they have enough story to do so. If not im going to read the VN's. I loved Henneko my 2nd favorite of the season. 

 Such a moving last episode... T_T I grabbed this screen capture (from the commercial break cut) and am now using it as a wallpaper on my home laptop. xD So much fun!

 Good ending for an anime that has 'hentai' in it's name, and surprisingly, not even ecchi. Second season is welcomed, though I have no idea what to continue after this.
