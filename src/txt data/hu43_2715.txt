 Avatar; The Legend of Korra - Book 3
 Well we're almost done with the season, but by far this is the best season of The Legend of Korra. Hardly any romance and more plot is developed with a great story. The latest episode had some of the best fighting I've ever seen in Avatar and there are a few WTF moments as well, mainly since it's a kids show. Some stuff I never would have thought to see in Avatar but it's great. I thought I wouldn't like Korra when this first began but she's grown on me.

 Glad you posted this. I just watched the last episode. Seems it's gotten more violent since it moved to online-only. The action is tremendous. I didn't like it as much as Avatar, but now I find myself looking forward to each episode.

 I doubt they added more action, it's the same amount, although they may have censored a bit if they put it on TV, I'm not sure. They are premade episodes, they wouldn't change stuff on such short notice.

 The season has been amazing. The last episode was the stand out of the season. It's the first time since Book 1 since we've seen Tenzin really let loose.

 You mean fighting wise? Either way, the fighting is way more like an anime than previous episodes.

 Yes fighting wise he hasn't done much since the fight against the future industries robots. I'm not sure if the fighting being more like an anime is a good thing or not lol

 ... During Book 1, I didn't like Korra, during Book 2 I grew fonder of her and liked that there was less love to it. And now, with Book 3 finished, I'm in astonishment at how good the story is. This Book blows the past Avatar the Last Air Bender story away, and for sure the past two books away. Anyway I'm now more then ever looking forward to Book 4. That being said, a few days back I had a dream about the Legend of Korra. It may be foolish to believe in dreams but after the end of Book 3 I see my dream having a possibly to be. My only thing is how many years have passed. So in my dream 71 years have passed and the world of the Avatar looks like the 90's. Korra is an old woman now, she's still alive that is, and what ever Book number this is, it's called Lure.

 Yeah the ending to Book 3 was Avatar at its absolute best. That tops the Last Air Bender finale for me by a long shot and has me unbelievably excited for Book 4.

 I keep forgetting it's a kids show, lol!  Spoiler I was wondering why it was so cheesy yet had some pretty violent scenes when it was taken off air. I don't get it...they want to show air being bended out of someone, but they can't make the series better?? Better character development and a decent plot? 
 Definitely an intense ending! I don't know if I can say it is better than the The Last Airbender finale. It's more mature for sure. I can't wait for book 4.  Spoiler P'Li's head exploding in the metal bent armor. Insanity! I hope they don't spend the entire next season dealing with a depressed Korra trying to find her way. Snap out of it fast! 
 ^ Irony, for me I hope we see Korra stuck in that wheel chair, I don't want to see a depressed Korra but I still want to see her as we saw her in the end of book 3. Now time to go look for a new avatar of the avatar.

 Book Two Korra was terrible, I despised her as a character. The supporting cast was awesome, every one of them had great skill, charming characterization, and personality. Book Three Korra was fantastic, and her struggle meshed well with her steadfast personality. Zaheer and his group of fugitives were really good enemies. The bittersweet ending and plethora of developments in the last few episodes were mind-blowing, what a hype season. I sincerely am awaiting the next season with a lot of hype, Book Three was terrific. 
 It sucks there's no new episode tomorrow
