 The new movie Dragon Ball Z "resurrection of freezer
 I'm always excited for a new movie. The Freeza saga was awesome I'm glad freeza gets another crack at Goku how freeza gets a new body or escapes hell is what I'm wondering. The most obvious is Freeza gets wished back by his minions by the dragon balls. I'm gonna bet my left arm a time machine is involved.
