[General Discussion] Hero V. Villain
 Villain His name would be Vukolak. And he would be deeply, deeply envious of others success in particular fields. So envious, that he uses his powers of energy manipulation and element bending of fire to murder those people he feels are better than him. The sad truth is that his pursuit of being better than others is what keeps him from succeeding where they succeeded. Vukolak will never be satisfied for long and never truly be happy. Always driven by his erratic emotions, he never ceases in his campaign against all he views as superior. Eventually, his envy will drive him utterly insane to the point that he has to be killed in order to save others from his blind rage. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
