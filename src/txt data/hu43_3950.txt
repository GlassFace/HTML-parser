 School days is the best one because of the fact that at the start it presents itself as nice then slowly degrades into evil. xD

 Hentai doesn't count...or should it? If so, this thread should be drowned while it is still an infant. Oh, mandatory contribution so as to avoid getting molested by moderators, Rainbow Nisha Rokubou No Shichinin Purpose of this thread is to just name the more darker anime that have been released? That's just a broad can of sadness that I personally don't find entertainment from.

I don't want to rustle anyone's jimmies, so I might as well input a personal selection of mine that seems to fit this thread's categorical spectrum. IS it a bit hypocritical of me to speak about how I, like many other people, dislike watching sad or dark anime? Is so, I never said I wasn't a hypocrite. 
 Beef alert! Monster is pretty appropriate for kiddies. Every kiddy should watch monster.

Afro Samurai uhhhh... Black lagoon? I just don't watch that very many child appropriate anime. And the ones I have seen, were already listed.. I watched elfen lied and loved it. I need more G rated anime.

 Taikutsu, you are sick. In a good way, lol. This thread is just misunderstanding waiting to happen though. Some will just see the topic and then look starting post and pick first one. Now we just wait until someone will come to report how their child is ruined. Ah My Buddha! Koi Kaze/Love Wind Onee-chan ga Kita Also I must have missed someone, since I'm sure someone must have said Yosuga no Sora already. Well apparently not. About school days(plot spoilers):  Spoiler School days is great because it starts being like kawaii-mode, this guy likes this girl and this girl likes this guy, but they are too shy. And that lasts what like 2 or 3 episodes? Then it goes full harem/hentai/echhi-mode and you think like, "So this is what's it gonna be". Then like towards the last 3 episodes it goes into this full drama/tragedy-mode with like all these things going public and the baby and stuff. And then in the end.. psychopatic/WTF-mode with well.. the ending. So basically it's rollercoaster of kawaii-ecchi-tragedy-WTF. Is that accurate description of school days?

 This is thread is an orgy for morons.

 Hold on, are these suggestions real or have I misunderstood the title of the thread? Hahaha.

It is instinct." - Akashi Seijuro (Kuroko no Basket) You can also find me in skyscrapercity, simtropolis, sc4devotions, the blue knight forum, mangafox, archives of our own, fanfiction, tumblr, blogspot, instagram, facebook and twitter.
 Yosuga No Sora To Love-ru Darkness Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance The first one is probably the most inappropriate and has incest so yeah be careful lol

Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils? Join Super-Powered and get in on the action!  Spoiler http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...-Super-Powered 
 Damn, Some people really need to remove that tentacle from their ass.
