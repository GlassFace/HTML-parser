[Image] Girlfriend or Beard... Which do you choose?
 Haha, I'm not a fan of beards, but I don't mind beards so much if they are kept. When I see someone with a big ugly all over the place beard, I think "Eww... a bird could have built a nest in there." Sorry, but I wouldn't want anyone coming near me with that thing. Haha. Some women love beards, others don't. It has nothing to do with phenomenon on the internet lmao.
