 ABC News does piece on video games, lulz are had
 A couple of days ago, Nightline, an ABC News segment, aired a piece on GamerGate and video games in general. For those of you who were around in the late 90's/early 2000's, you went through the Jack Thompson media storm when he called video games "murder simulators," "mental masturbation," and Japanese video games "Pearl Harbor 2," this is essentially the same thing. In Anita's defense she doesn't call Japanese video games another Pearl Harbor, but she did have this to say about Japan: “The US bombed them back to traditional values – feminism does not exist in Japan. While I don’t like judging an entire culture…that does not excuse them.” I'm not sure what it is with armchair sociologists and their fascination with Japan's military history, but I guess Anita decided that Pearl Harbor analogies weren't good enough and had to pick at a scab as horrible as the bombings of hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom were women and children. Anyway, here are some highlights from the video: 1. Host takes two seconds to say that video games contain violent depictions of rape. wut 2. Same non-analytic, one-sided journalism as we've come to expect of anything about games. Yawn. 3. Within 12 hours of video being posted, ABC starts shadowbanning people and deleting comments from the comments page because those comments have more likes than the video itself, sitting at 95% downvotes. 4. Anita suggesting that playing video games causes misogyny. For anybody who wants to doubt point 4, here are the words from her mouth: Games have a huge impact on our society, so it's not just fantasy... it actually works to potentially reinforce some pretty harmful messages about women. Anyway, welcome to 2015: where video games don't cause violence, but they do cause sexism! Are you guys also enjoying the mass hysteria narrative being pushed by the media about games? Who else is enjoying the Jack Thompson logic in mainstream media? 
 
 Scott raises valid points, she takes things way too far. Her exaggeration is drastic and her over generalization of games is ridiculous since she specifically targets the most mainstream or popular games. She has no clue what she's talking about since she's just basically judging the surface. Pic related:

 Comparing Anita to actual feminists is something that some people do, but I don't like those comparisons. She's a sex-negative social critic who has made an (incomplete) series of videos with Jonathon McIntosh, a lunatic who believes that Tetris music is Soviet propaganda. She cites people who have been excommunicated from academic communities decades ago and is seemingly oblivious to this fact. Anybody fully invested in feminism would not be caught dead citing Dworkin after 1985. She's more of a really good publicist in my opinion. You have to admit, when it comes to publicizing herself, she's amazing. Her story is really good--middle upper class white woman getting attacked by horde of angry proto-school shooters? It's the exact kind of stuff that mainstream media loves to take off with. The story practically sells itself, and the mainstream media has high motivation to take it on because they compete with video games as a source of entertainment. It's kind of ironic that she's benefited this extensively by being a decent looking white woman when you think about it. Both men and women face harassment online, and as it turns out, men face more. Feminists despite their constant announcement that it's supposed to benefit both sexes seem overly concerned with the harassment women face though... I wonder why that is? I used to hate the term equality+. Now in certain brands of feminism it's just something I can't argue isn't the main goal. 
 I keep going back to doom and Columbine. (It was tragic of course but video games and movies weren't the culprit) Tragedies happen and video games get the blame. Unfortunately That still hasn't changed.

 Never interfere with your enemies when they are in the process of destroying themselves. They don't care about feminism, they care about being cultural gatekeepers. Anita and co. have been radicalizing their rhetoric at a pretty outlandish pace, in the process they're basically pissing off anyone they claimed to be defending, and further radicalized moderates who otherwise might have supported them, if only out of ignorance. They're wielding highly potent forms of social engineering and repackaging everything into a narrative of victimization and sweeping social movements tailored for modern news media who just eat it all up. It goes beyond "misogyny," people like McIntosh legitimately believe that video games cause real world atrocities. That's not even hyperbole, they really believe that media causes actual damage to society, that video games and people of the male gender are responsible for the downfall of modern civilization. These people not only want to control what media you can consume, but also your thoughts and emotions. Die Gedanken sind Frei. Lock me in the deepest, darkest dungeon such actions are futile my thoughts smash gates and walls Thoughts are free

They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 Chris Scott's part of this piece is the only thing that doesn't make me role my eyes. "Whats her face" is ABSOLUTELY trying to capitalize controversy. And the dumb *******s who are sending her threats are helping her prove her whatever inkling point. She can damn well say whatever she wants. It's the people who buy into it and the people who feed harassment to that beast are the idiots. I didn't notice any statistics in this piece - The amount of women who get mugged and killed in Watch Dogs compared to the amount of men who get mugged and killed (because they very well did too). There has yet to be a decent link between video game violence and real life violence. I'm currently playing "The Cat Lady" on steam. I'm a middle-aged woman in that game. I've killed two men so far. And there is more to come. I don't see any media attention man whores making turning it into game developers attacking the character and value of men.

Because it's an absolutely ludicrous argument steeped in faulty logic. You cannot rationalize with people who blatantly reject facts, whose response to dissenting criticism is a campaign of censorship and slander. Anita gave a testimonial for a pyramid scheme, her best friend McIntosh is clearly off his rocker, her Masters thesis was absolute garbage that spits on academia, she is years late on an unfinished video series she was paid to do, instead she tours the country accepting made up awards and speaking at paid events about how much of a victim she is. Speaking about about how those stereotypical basement dwelling, backwards, greasy nerds with their boys club are ganging up on poor little girl Anita. Her entire livelihood is based around being a victim, she stands to lose everything if suddenly she was no longer a victim. Toward that end I'm willing to bet that a majority of the threats she receives are blackflags carried out on her behalf. I hope the threats keep coming in, because the day that someone actually looks into them and catches these *******s as they threaten themselves everything will tumblr down around them.

I'd rather her harassment stop. It would completely knock her off of her ridiculous soap box and force her to attack something else. Maybe at some point this whole thing was entertaining, but now it's just annoying.

Maybe at some point this whole thing was entertaining, but now it's just annoying. The harassment will never stop. The SJWs have simply moved the goalpost too far on what constitutes harassment at this point. Essentially any contact which does not agree with their opinions is now classified as harassment. I mean hell, Twitter even included a reporting option for this: See that at the top of "What are you reporting?" It's grouped together with "generally offensive" and "disrespectful" comments. Anyway, ABC has made a mockery of journalism and I'm glad that they made this report in the end. Gamers have always been on the fringe of society where it's acceptable to bully, bash, vilify, and generalize them, so why should the year 2015 be any different? Sam Biddle seems to have gotten his wish with his "bring back bullying" comments, except the bullies now aren't middle and high school students, but mid to late 20's/early 30's "journalists" who are bashing the people they're supposed to be on the same side as. It's their way of being progressive because video games cause violence or something.

Maybe at some point this whole thing was entertaining, but now it's just annoying. You don't get it. The reason she has this victimization routine and radical rhetoric is because she cannot stand up in the world of legitimate debate. She blocks comments in literally every medium under the guise of "creating a 'safe space for feminism." She wants to be taken seriously and produce research taught in academic institutions yet she won't ever, under any circumstance, engage in social discourse. The beautiful thing is that she doesn't need to either, the media and the SJW horde have all been more than willing to eat it up. Imagine a world where the evidence is the accusation, because it's just starting to settle in.

Imagine a world where the evidence is the accusation, because it's just starting to settle in. If she doesn't want to rebut any type of legitimate debate, then shame on her. She should have a stance to defend herself and her beliefs. Harassment is completely different. The death/rape threats and sexual harassment - she doesn't have to stand for it because there is no legitimate debate there. Just ugly and crude comments. It is rather smart of her to capitalize on this aspect of her project(s). Take away the harassment and what does she have left? Just the people who will take her seriously and she will indeed have to fend for herself. Right now, she doesn't have to do anything other than what she's doing because it's obviously working for her.

 Good at getting attention/has (bad) pride. She overgeneralizes, and forgot about good video games that are being used for patients' rehabilitation (and that was on the news a year before I heard Sarkeesian 1st time.) Everybody has pride for a justified reason. She throws reasoning out of the window. Wonder what it's like to be her, what she does for work skills, idk. I would guess this is the work she's best at. If she said something good, then I'd be happy. I liked those gamers at the arcade though. A family of buds I'd like. And I liked that video posted by MoSteel. It's like a parody to Sarkeesian's argument. 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
 I'm about to watch it, this is going to be hilarious. I don't think I've ever seen a video with such a low like to dislike ratio on youtube. EDIT: Just finished. I am literally crying over how funny this is. This is my new favorite comedy. But seriously, 99% of was utter BS, especially the watchdogs part. EDIT 2: Watching more of Anita's videos, they're hilarious. I love how she can blatantly ignore facts and completely cherrypick a single scene to state that the entire game is sexist. EDIT 3: I'm so done.

 So, it's kind of funny how things work out sometimes. Stephanie, AKA Sushilulu, the girl in the video who was being sexually harassed by the male gamer in Counter-Strike, had another interview with an independent gaming blogger. In the video she trashes Anita, denies ever getting a single rape or death threat, and sheds light on problems that females face in gaming communities. Her opinion does not reflect the story that Nightline spun. A few days prior, the guy used as an example of "some gamers are fighting back," heavily disagreed with the segment as well. He did a Q&A on le reddit (if you're curious to check it out). So the people they interviewed don't even agree with them? Oh, except Anita, but it was her narrative being pushed in the first place because that's the most dramatic one possible. Oh boy. 
 http://gamergate.me/2014/12/behind-t...na-sarkeesian/ kinda late on this...but did anyone read this piece? Read over it a bit, didn't understand much, will read it again later. Dat harvard level use of the English language doe. Although, it's deliberately done so to protect the identity of the person who wrote this. 
 That article is terrible.

Literally nothing wrong with the article other than it being overly convoluted in its use of language. it was on purpose to protect the identity of Harvard faculty.

 Go on video comments on youtube large youtubers like TB had their comments remove, looks like ABC is following Anita's example. 
 Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide. *Bill The Butcher - Gangs Of New York* 
 Was kind of hopeful that @ThisGuy would respond to my post because apparently 'I didn't get it.' When...yeah, I get it and I also think I'm smarter but that's a whole other thing I'm not going to get into. Anyway....Anyone see the latest episode of Law & Order: SVU as of today (2/13) on hulu. It was basically Anita's story and Zoe's story mixed together and then taken to the extreme. Kind of interesting.
