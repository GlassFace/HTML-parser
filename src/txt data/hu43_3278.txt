[Review] Legend of zelda thread!
 Twilight Princess was my favourite, f-ck me right? Koji Kondo pretty much made what Legend of Zelda is today, I honestly believe that without him the series wouldn't have done so well. For those who don't know who he is, here's an excerpt from wiki "Koji Kondo is a Japanese video game composer and sound director who has been employed at Nintendo since 1984. He is best known for scoring numerous titles in the Mario and The Legend of Zelda series" I'd say his biggest and most famed works lie in Ocarina of time, who'd argue though? Lost woods & Gerudo Valley were Godlike.
