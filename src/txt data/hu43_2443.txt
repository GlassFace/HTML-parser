 Recent Downtime
 As I am sure many of you are aware, we had a long downtime in the last few days. We had a major failure that on its own takes a fair bit of time to fix (rebuilding part of the database), but also had server limitations that slowed down the task of rebuilding. All fixed now though. Thank you for bearing with us.
