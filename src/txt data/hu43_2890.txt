[Anime] Why Did You Start Watching Anime? - Page 3
 I started when on holidays this summer. I had nothing to do, and due to my piano teacher's influence, I googled what anime I should begin to watch. I eventually brought it to Nerdfighters where I got lots of recommendations. Death Note was the first I saw, so I turned on the TV and fell into the world of anime. I watched the first 5 episodes and then switched to the first Fulllmetal Alchemist series. By the time school had started this year, I owned all 27 volumes of FMA and had began to watch FMA: Brotherhood. The rest is the distant past to me, considering how much of my daily life involves this new obsession. 
Humankind cannot gain anything without first sacrificing something else in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost.
