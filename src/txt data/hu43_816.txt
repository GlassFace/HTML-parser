[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires - Page 4

 So happy the second season is here, I love this series. The first episode was paced slowly but I enjoyed it a lot. 
 Let's ignore the stupid lengthy unimportant bot post above. Yeah, valvrave is back. Been waiting for this. Now the valvraves are complete. My guess is that the second season will be focusing more on land battles rather than space battles, just as hinted in the opening. And is it just me that feels valvrave unit 2 would be a major badass?

 OMG i LOVE this anime!!! i feel like its forever when im waiting for the next episode. 
 Haha yeah, it's pretty enjoyable. Curious if we'll see them drop the overheating problem now that they're in an atmosphere instead of out in space. Or if the Valvraves will even function properly on Earth, for that matter. 

 just watched the first 2 epis of this season, really cool so far, gotta love it! and solid opening theme as well

 what the flying **** episode 3? That ending, and I thought this can't get any crazier. I'm loving it. Looks like the Valvrave will get beaten the **** out of them.

 That's until Marie and Haruto both pilot the original Valvrave. And then so begins why Saki and Haruto are not together in 200 years.

 Episode 4 Holy crap, Valvrave... you did it again! Remember when we used to call Madoka a "dark show"? You have magical girls, then you have Puella Magi Madoka Magica. You have mechas, then you have Kakumeiki Valvrave. :/ Damn, this show gets me every time! By the way, they say the last Madoka Magica movie is supposed to be expectedly dark... I can't wait till it airs here (I already have my tickets)! I eat this dark stuff up, which is why I'm just loving Valvrave right now!

 When watching Valvrave, expect the unexpected.  Spoiler It was a bit sad when Marie once again lost her memories. It's all about Shoko too right? I mean she helped out Marie and the shut in girl.

I mean she helped out Marie and the shut in girl.  Spoiler Yup, Shoko would have to be Marie's best friend, and Marie was probably one of Shoko's best. I want to find out what happens now with her. After losing everything, can she start anew? Or has she completely lost her mind or her soul? "Sayonara, Marie" was a very ominous message... I think she may have forfeited her life to save everyone.

 Was waiting for something like this after they brought up Runes at the beginning of the season. Pretty sad episode, RIP Marie, wasn't expecting her to bite it so soon. 

 Well, I guess she made the right decision. Unit 1 was so beautiful when  Spoiler Marie piloted it, after all she was the test pilot for it.

 Dang, crazy episode. I wonder if any of the JIORians piloted Haruto's or Cain's units, would experience the withdrawal symptoms Haruto gets? Although who knows since apparently Cain took the AI/ghost out of Unit 2 and seems to be using it for other purposes now anyway. I do wonder if they modified/replaced the core in Unit 1 with one like the other four units have, if it'd be safe from Rune loss? Was kind of surprised when the AI chick said L-Elf wouldn't work either, I had been suspecting the Karlstein school was the same thing as the JIORian high school colony block. The volcano bit was hilarious and felt like something straight out of Code Geass S2. 

 craazy vampire people? Check rape and a sudden marriage proposal? Check freaking big and powerful mechas? Check Lovestory? Check Lunatic father? Check a glowing girl, who has lights all over her body?? Check  Spoiler Cain seems like he's been possed by someone, like before he killed H-Neun. He said "This man has said that?". Yeah, Vampires Everywhere. I just hope they never stop surprising me with all this.

I'm so agreed. I just love the roller-coaster twists and turns in this show! Going through both seasons with eyes wide open!

 I just realized that Haruto hasn't been "hungry" throughout season 2. He hasn't lost control of himself yet. 
 Dubstep Chaos Theory - ShockOne l Siren - Kat Krazy ft Elkka l Faith - BlasterJaxx 
 It seemed like he and L-Elf had come to an arrangement early on in the season, after Haruto was locked up in that jail cell flipping out. Pretty sure he's just feeding on L-Elf as necessary, which should mean L-Elf is losing memories/runes. 

 Yup, Valvrave 1 noticed that he's been losing memories.

 L-Elf is gonna lose memories of his precious princess.... oh boy.

 Holy crap... Episode 21... MY BODY WAS NOT READY FOR THIS! I always steel myself before I watch Valvrave, especially after knowing that **** is about to go down....  Spoiler but dammit, I was not ready for that slaughter!
