[Anime] Any slow-paced anime?
 I'm looking for anime that is slow-paced, and calm in nature. Not a whole lot of action. The story unfolds gently throughout. Mushishi is one example of what I'm looking for. Any others? Thanks. 
 Well there's clannad and boys be

 If you are looking for another title that is supernatural and slow paced calm in nature, Natsume Yuujinchou would fit the bill. Ristorante Paradiso - It is a slower paced show about a girl who goes to Roma and works at a restaurant becoming the understudy of a chef. It is a Drama. Along those lines there is Antique Bakery, and The Bartender. Bartender is for the most part an episodic show, and shows a bartender who can sort of give encouragement/help/advice through the drink that he makes for you. Going back to calm in nature: Kino's Journey is a lot like Mushishi. It has a lot of introspection, as Kino travels through the various lands running into different people along the way. It has some action at times, but for the most part it is the journey. 
 
 Usagi Drop is pretty slow paced! its a really lovely anime. 
 Credit to Token for the signature! poke him if you want one 8D Check out the Osu! and the Wallpaper Thread
 Angel beats is fairly slow paced

 I think you can call Fate Stay Night and Fate/Zero both slow paced anime? Yeah. It's a good slow paced anime.

 Most Key anime are pretty slow paced, and well made. Clannad, Kanon (2006), Air, Little Busters!, and Angel Beats. Waiting In The Summer is pretty slow paced, until the last couple episodes, as well as Please, Teacher! Rumbling Hearts is also really slow paced, but it has some nudity and gets pretty depressing, a lot like one by Key 
I hate this town. It's too filled with memories I'd rather forget. I go to school everyday, hang out with my friends, and then I go home. There's no place I'd rather not go ever again. I wonder if anything will ever change. Will that day ever come? -Tomoya Okazaki
 Kemono no Souja erin(It's the be all, end all of dramas, I don't think It's even possible for someone not to like this anime) Watch Moribito Guardian of the Spirit, that's the masterpiece you're looking for(the most realistic char in the history of anime, and it has downright the best handling of the passage of time I have ever seen, you can basically feel the months going by, which migh very well be one of the biggest achievements ever made in the industy, since It's a very short series, only 26 ep). Also yea like others have stated, Clannad+Clannad After Story fits the bill. You could also try Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight(It's a very good series, that would count as being slow placed as well) It's not as good as the above, but It's still very much worth a watch if you haven't seen it. Oh yea lets not forget detective Academy Q(It's a awesome mystery anime).

 I second Key's work. Pretty much any slice of life comedy is slow paced such as Lucky Star and Azumanga Daioh. You might also want to check out Bakemonogatari.

 What about Hyouka? I think Hyouka has a fairly slow pacing as well.

 maybe too slow paced? I certainly thought so.

 Ergo Proxy has some pretty slow pacing throughout the middle. The beginning moves quickly enough, and the ending moves too fast, but the bulk of the series moves quite slowly, as the protagonists drift across the wasteland of the world on an airship of sorts. The dark, gloomy nature of the series helps make the pacing seem all the slower...though this doesn't hinder the plot in any way, since the overall plot isn't terribly strong to begin with. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 I found 12 Kingdoms (十二国期) to have a really calm pacing, despite some intense action sequences interspersed throughout. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Kingdoms

However nomatter what someone is looking for, if they haven't yet, they really need to watch the Twelve Kingdoms, It's undebatably one of the best anime ever created. 
 So many ideas! Thanks everyone! (keep em coming if you know anymore) 
 Since clannad is an obvious choice for a flow paced anime, I would recommend the Ef series or Kanon, both are very similar to clannad (Kanon is produced by the same studio as clannad)
