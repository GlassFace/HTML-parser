[Personal Life Discussions] College Studies, What are You Enrolled For?
 I am back in college and almost half-way through with my associate's degree in Information Technology. I want to get my certification in PC Pro, Network Pro, and Security Pro. I am so far been taking general courses and only one IT course back in September in which I made my first 4.0 in (most were 3.7s and a shotty 2.3 in business cause of death in the family that pushed me back). My GPA is near 3.6 and I want to go for my bachelor's after my associate's. I think I want to do either Networking, Programming, working with the cloud or PC Software or Hardware.
