[Action] Space Dandy - Page 4

The anime seems different. but I don't think CN had anything to do with how Space Dandy was made. I guess I didn't really pay attention to the promos and just made up my own Watanabe Cowboy bebop style anime in my head and that might be why I'm disappointed. I am certain of this. cowboy Bebop it aint Yeah I more or less meant I understand why they picked it up in such an unusual manner; it fits right in with their line up. Sorry if that was confusing! All they had to do with it was shoveling money into the studios pockets. 

 So was the first episode the last one? Guess its gonna follow Bebop and Champloo with its episodic nature followed by 3 episode arc concerning the actual money shot plot! BTW, both those shows (especially the latter) are overrated. Anyway, chortled a number of times (Alien backstory...got a light?) and colours remind me of Little Witch Academia. That is a good thing. Wanna see more hand to hand combat. Rachals intro was great.

 I love the anime so far, it's random but great. I have to ask, does anyone else feel a Kamina--Gurran Lagann--vibe from Dandy?

 I'm seriously trying my hardest to like this show, I really am, but i can't help but find it so annoying. The lack of female representation, with every girl that Dandy runs into is nothing more but eye candy. Beside the animation, and style of the show, the only thing I find interesting is the idea of him being a space hunter. If Dandy's personality wasn't just " OH I NEED BOOBIES" I think the show would be better. But hey, maybe his idiotic personality is whats driving the story. But like i said, I do like the animation, and it's quirky style. But this past episode (That aired on CN) was interesting. I wasn't expecting that twist haha. 

 I enjoy the show quite a bit, but equate it to the "junk food" of anime: great music, awesome art, random plot, constant scifi/anime/pop cultural references (hell there are countless references just in the opening), not a particularly new premise, completely unashamed of its "less savory" bits and ultimately it doesn't take itself seriously. The music is really kickass! 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 Just finished episode 3. What is there to say? This series is ****ing awesome. I especially liked the part at the end when  Spoiler Dandy is in the mech and fights the alien. 
 Dandy is the worst shot, but he looks epic as f*ck being the worst. The show is corny as all hell and for me that is what makes it funny. Sometimes corny is what you need and yah this show doesn't take it self seriously. Also I loved the *cencored cencored cencored* part. Boob monster FTW.

I'm not sure if I see that. there are some similarities i guess but not many. Kamina was a move forward and believe no matter what kind of guy. I don't think Dandy has faith in anything unless its a move forward and believe in boobies faith. Though Dandy could be a spoof of the kind of character Kamina is. If I look at it in that light I think I see what your saying more. Originally Posted by Protoss Just finished episode 3. What is there to say? This series is ****ing awesome. I especially liked the part at the end when  Spoiler Dandy is in the mech and fights the alien. I will admit. even though I have seen that same exact story line of 'some one is not what they seem and is actually a monster in disguise' so many times before. it was a much better episode. I actually enjoyed it. Maybe this was the turning point. I still hate that annoying robot. I am starting to think its anime's job to have one super annoying character in every show. I'm even curious why the whatever empire (?) wants Dandy so bad. I know its going to be some ridiculous reason but its getting to me just the same. Meow is coming along well as a personality also. I'm looking forward to the next and hope the trend continues.

Thats not a fair take on it. so far, out side of hooter he we have only seen 2 woman. Scarlet, from the alien registration center and the boob monster. Scarlet has shown herself to be the typical female anime bad a_ _ and has a position of authority. You can't expect the hooters girls to be anything but eye candy. they aren't really integral to the show. they are almost like pretty landscaping around a building central to any show so I don't really count them. looking that way means 50% of the female's are important bad ass characters.

 ^Do you not how to multiquote? Why not just use an @ <username)? Something to ponder, you've been here long enough. Anyway, I'm changing my mind about the dub. It sucks. Sure the voices aren't that bad, however, the delivery is god awful. Its like the actors think they're above the dialogue and it completely destroys the already weak jokes lol. Now the Japanese voice actors to quote the title of the first episode...go with the flow baby! It adds to the madness and if not laugh out loud it doesn't wreck the buildup. Don't even get me started on timing. The 'scantily glad' female characters are meant to be a spoof of the genre but also pander to the same audience its mocking. I am ok with it on both counts. 
 Jesus, another ridiculous episode. But once again; how could you care? It's too great. That ending though:  Spoiler Everything is a zombie so much that the narrarator is a zombie. Then the screen says "Directed by George A. Romero" I ****ing lost it. 
 Yeah that might have been the best "zombie" episode of anything.

 Awesome a show. Nerd giggled throughout. That bit where Dandy slips on a banana skin during the sniper sequence. So glad I didn't have anything in my mouth. Beverage or otherwise... This show also has a 'reboot/undo' button a la South Park/Warner bros cartoons incase anyone hasn't noticed and thinks they're watching a proper linear show, lol. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Just sad the last episode didn't have a Thriller reference to it.

 Wasn't there dancing? Might've imagined it. But yeah, the narrator putting on a Vincent Price voice would've killed. Good call.

 "I don't know why but we have this strong urge to go to the mall all the time." That episode was so great, the music was quite fitting. The art appeared to go a bit wonky at the hospital, I'm not sure if this is because there were more characters on screen or if this was supposed to be a reference to something.

 How in the hell did we get a heart felt episode? Trust me, I loved it but just; it was simple damn feels. 
 Ehhh, I saw another side of Dandy in last night's episode so it's all good.

 Space dandy first remind me of excel saga due to it's randomness.but then the last episode that aired seem to start a plot.

 I still really do prefer that some kind of story develops eventually, but after that race episode; I officially care that much less. 
 Yeah I know,after that pooch episode last night i give up on this show it's not good as I thought it would be....first anime of the year to drop.It never gonna have a plot at this point. Gel:give me some sick beats Bea! Bea:*does it* Gel:What when you do it it shoots missiles?! Lol the funniest part of the episode.

 What the hell is up with the feels episodes? Don't get me wrong; I love them but Jesus I really never see them coming. 
 It wants to be Cowboy Bebop by having comedy and feels, but it's significantly better at comedy then feels. 

 After watching episode nine, my only reaction is: WHAT DRUGS IS DANDY TAKING AND HOW DO I GET THEM??  Spoiler  Spoiler  Spoiler
