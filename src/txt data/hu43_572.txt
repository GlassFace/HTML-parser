[Mystery] Psycho-Pass - Page 5

It's really annoying to see this new writer start to ruin Psycho Pass, honestly. Gen needs to stop handing his projects off to people. Happened with a few of his shows now. I agree with your sentiment. The new characters didn't leave much of an impression. Though, its just the first episode. But seriously the number of characters introduced is way too much. Season 1 had seven to eight people but I couldn't keep track of all the characters that were shown in this episode. Honestly, if the writer has the balls he would put Kougami as the force that will bring down the Sibyl system. That would really make for a good story. Anyways I'm hoping Kougami and Akane to bump into each other while they are after that new Makishima. Also that drug called Lacouse that they introduced kind of seems like a logical fault. Didn't the episode describe that Lacouse can keep one's hue under check? Then how did that bombers hue climb up... oh! He was bait. I get it.

 The gore was insane! I almost had to puke, too much for me. You know fun fact. This season's Psycho Pass isn't even Directed by Urobuchi Gen and yet we get a complete massacre in this weeks episode damn. There is a movie coming out in January 2015 which will be directed by Gen, apparently it will take place two years after the second season. Can't wait!

 THIS WAS GREAT! I wonder whose psycho pass will get clouded first Akanes or Mikas (or whatever her name is) Am I the only one who wants more Shinya Kogami instead? No you are not. I'm with you.

 Now it all makes sense! This guy is creepy... And Akane is being stalked!Q :o 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 This is getting better and better every single episode!! Togane is gettin creepier every episode too... Is he playing some kind of twisted game too, or is he just a stalker???

 He did say he wants to turn her color black.... o_o I'm kind of curious, though it doesn't make much difference... but when Akane said that a dominator can't be used against an inspector, did she say that because she was unaware that dominators do actually work against inspectors as they would any other civilian, depending on their co-efficient (as was verified with Risa's death)... or because she was that confident in the inspectors' low co-efficients (which really only applies to her)? Also, when she had that drone gun and Kamui was on the boat with Mizue... Kamui was right when he said she wouldn't shoot, but if it were me in that situation, I would have used the drone gun to blast away the stolen dominators which were conveniently laid out by their feet. Shion is still best girl (in Psycho-Pass and Higurashi both, lol!)... Not too sure what to think of Mizue at this point... Sho is still awesome... Ginoza and Tsunemori are becoming quite the team... Ginoza is taking Kogami's place, after his father's death and his demotion to an enforcer, which took the stick out of his ass. His character is developing a lot, which is good! And this shot of Mika is just classic. Speaking of... these are from the archives...

 Ughhhh. I finished Psycho Pass in maybe two days when I first heard of it. I love it. I can't remember the last time a series seriously made me think of how the human condition directly relates to society if some kind of system was put in place to make it perfect. One of my new favorite shows for sure. The second season, I'm sad to say, does not capture me like the first season did. But I will certainly keep watching it. 
 No real disagreement there. The second season is not near the first season. The first season was more mystery, the second season is more thriller. They're both quality programming though, and do a good job at what they're doing.

 So Togane is a serial killer?? or something?? who turns inspectors into criminals?...I guess he has to get his high from somewhere...

 Finally marathoned season 2 to the latest ep! Real roller coaster ride up to the revelation  Spoiler "Oka-san" I'd say I'm puzzled they add in a character like Mika?? I'm really annoyed by her. Anyway, the mystery and gore still gripped me.

 I don't understand Mika at all. How can she blame Akane for the death of inspectors?? In reality it's all her own fault!! She let Kamui escape from the pharmacy!! Her decision to stay put and follow ''law'' is what drove to sooo many deaths!!! And Togane... Well He became more interesting... Does this sibyl system want to get rid off Akane?? For what?? Clean psycho-pass or knowing too much???
