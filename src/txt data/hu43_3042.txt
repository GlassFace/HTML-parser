 Interracial Relationships - Page 2
 Have any of you been in an interracial relationship? Did you get asked stupid questions all the time? How did your relatives react? For some, they're lucky and their families are totally cool with it. I'm from a really conservative white area so interracial dating, especially white women dating non-white people, will get you really odd stares and the occasional remark, "How come you don't date Canadians?" (Implying anyone who isn't white as not Canadian...). I've had all the stupid questions asked to me because both of my long-term relationships have been interracial. Luckily, both my ex's and my boyfriend's families have been pretty cool with it. Mine... not so much sometimes. I've probably just been unlucky with who asks me questions. For some reason, because I got upset when some girls were dissing Asian guys and told them my boyfriend was Asian, they retorted, "Oh, so you must think all Asian guys are hot, right?" Oh dear lord. I'm just wondering if anyone's faced any face-palm worthy situations and if anyone's had similar circumstances as me. Maybe you come from a city where it's generally more acceptable. Hopefully, HOPEFULLY you're not someone who goes after someone based on their race or fetishizes someone for being "exotic". Because if you do, stay away.
