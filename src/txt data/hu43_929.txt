[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Great start to the season! Little slow with the pacing, but lot of infodump kinda stuff going on. The subatomic particle junk was just dumb pseudoscience, but it's all good since we're on track for more crazy vampire crap.
