[Slice of Life] Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui/It's Not My Fault I'm Popular
 It’s Not My Fault That I’m Not Popular (Watashi ga Mote Nai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!) is a manga series, That got a green-lit Anime Adaption on January 2012 and will be aired on 8th July 2013. Originally Posted by Synopsis Kuroki Tomoko is a super popular, high school girl, who has had 50 years of dating experience, and 100 boys… in the Otome game world. In the real world, she is a 15 year old shut in, who has all of the qualities of a “mojo” (a gloomy or unpopular woman). However, when school isn’t going as she expected, and she isn’t as popular as she had thought she was, she takes a look at herself in the mirror for the first time in a few years, and has some shocking revelations… The series consists of Tomoko doing various things to try to become more social and popular, with these attempts usually blowing up in her face in embarrassing ways.

 Thought it was a reverse God Only Knows anime but looks like it's going to be different. Gotta say I'll probably check this out.

 sounds like 'My Teenage Romantic Comedy'.

 Friends of mine have read the manga, it's supposedly really good, I'll be sure to check it out when it airs. 
 @ShikinamiDesu You can also find me on Hummingbird! 
 ^I'm his friend and it really is GOOD, for noooow. 
 Credit to Token for the signature! poke him if you want one 8D Check out the Osu! and the Wallpaper Thread
 I agree with Drexz, this does sound like My Teenage Romantic Comedy, Though that isn't a bad thing. Can anyone else verify that the manga is worth checking out? Ill probably end up trying it out even if no one else backs it up :P

 I am looking forward to this show, I have heard great things. 

 Haha yeah the starting bit sounds a bit like The World Only God Knows. It sounds really promising. Im going to watch this when i finish the World Only God Knows Thanks

 WataMote episode 1 is out now! Still waiting for subs though...

 Subs are out. The art style seems more American cartoon then traditional anime. It works though.

 First episode was great, but she's so awkward. Really like planing a route to get to somewhere, I always do that but considering her, she's a super extreme case of antisocial. But she's upbeat about it so that's nice.

 Tragic! Simply tragic! Definitely a top pick for this season. :3

 I had to get on and mention this, I literally just started this show and the Opening is FREAKING AMAZING. Once I finish ill BE BACK!! 

 I was seriously laughing the whole way through. A Dark Comedy which I like.  Spoiler This was my favorite part...THERE WAS NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT THAT CONVERSATION AT ALL LOL 

 Easily one of the better animes I have seen recently. Really funny and it seemed pretty original. Sentai Filmworks better license this!

 Im up to date with the manga and Im glad this got an anime~ Hell the OP is utterly amazing though it through me for a loop for a moment. This is going to be one intense anime since thats how she is within the manga. Its definitely worth reading. 
 Beat it raw  Spoiler 
 I just watched the first episode now. I don't think I've laughed this much at an anime for a really long time. For some reason, it's giving me lucky star vibes with the whole 'main character is a recluse' thing. I guess Konata had friends though, so kinda different. I'm looking forward to episode 2. 

 My lord episode two was hilarious. I am so glad they showed the drawing of Tomoko even though it did not mean a thing haha. 

 She's so freaking awkward. I really have nothing more to say, but I love this anime.

 Looks like an awesome anime, but I cant stand not marathoning a 12 episode series. 
 this anime is so funny! I relate to so many of her situations it's ridiculous ;_; I can't wait for episode 3!!!!
