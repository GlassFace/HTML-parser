 So is there already a Angel beats! game?
 Because there is one being released in 2014? 

 Hmm yes, I wouldn't say "already" because apparently it was floating around for sometime (after the shows airing I think). From what I know, it's likely going to be a visual novel. I'm assuming it has only recently started it's development this year, otherwise it would be out already if I assumed correctly. It may be good, it may be bad or it could be somewhere in between. but I don't have high hopes. (though I may of course be wrong).

 If it allows paths that are alternate to the way the show went then I might check it out but if it's the the show in visual novel form I probably won't touch it. Could be interesting though if something actually comes of it.

 Would be really cool if it was though, but I wouldn't think that either before they release anymore about it. I really liked the show though so I am interested for now atleast 
 I'll be keeping up on this game for sure, I want to know what the final GP will be. I hope they don't make it a Novel type imo that'll destroy it, it can be created to be an excellent game...but we'll see. P.S. Never liked visual novel types. -.-
