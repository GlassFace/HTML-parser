There was actually an article I saw yesterday talking about how Starship Troopers wasn't the 'brilliant satire' everyone praised it for. And I think this validly applies here as well, since the satire wasn't exactly that clever in the first place. If anything, it felt more like a parody than a satire, since a satire should have something meaningful to say, and the stuff in KnK just feels... silly. I don't know. I just didn't feel like continuing the series near the end; it felt kinda 'meh' to me, and I wasn't impressed by it. Maybe the rewatch will change my opinion.
