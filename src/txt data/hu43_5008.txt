[Personal Life Discussions] First thing you would save in a Fire
 I would save myself, first and foremost. Second would be my PC. I spent a pretty penny and had her built over the course of several months. She is the culmination of years of hard work and money saving. She would be saved as an absolute. After that, if I could save my figures and displays, I would. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
