[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 I thought episode 2 was pretty awesome. The whole switching bodies thing, i didn't see that coming. and also not sure how I feel about SHOKO'S "DEATH being like the main driving force for the main characters action ( Hmm where have I see this beforee? (We all know) ) Love will make you do crazy things huh? He did like a complete 360 in his personality, or has he always been like that? he just needed it to be brought out of him. Plus now that we find out she's not really dead, that was the part where I sighed in relief, he's in too deep now, and I'm interested in what's to come for him. Plus that L-elf guy, is a great soldier, it's safe to say now he's gonna be up against his side for most of the series.
