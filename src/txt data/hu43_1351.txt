 Breaking Bad: Final Eight Episodes start August 11th - Page 3
 BIGGEST WTF MOMENT WHAT THE ****. breaking bad just reached epic heights.  Spoiler Todd and his gank members are ****ing retards, it was sort of predictable at that point that they were going to refuse walts command not to go into the dessert and carry out their ****. But as soon as they considered walt being a cooker again they started to **** things up right from the beginning. HANK IS DEAD FOR SURE NEXT EPISODE. same with his mexican friend 100 percent. Jesse is most likely gonna escape from that confrontation as he was already about to escape. Once the gun fire ceases i think walt is just gonna tell them to stop (jesse already running away). Probably get together with jesse after to get revenge on the czechs possibly even try to destroy their entire empire or something. okay maybe that prediction is going too far. It's so godamn unpredictable at this point. Most likely this is where walter leaves, as we see in the flash forward where he is in LA and eating breakfast. next episode please. 
  Spoiler For paramilitary white power douchebag types, those guys sure sucked at shooting. I can just imagine Tova and Volk having a 20 page discussion on why that final scene was unrealistic. Guess kids are easier to hit. Loved it though, and it seemed to last longer due to the way it was shot. Intense as ****. HANK IS DEAD FOR SURE NEXT EPISODE. same with his mexican friend 100 percent. I think everyone expected Hank and Gomie to be goners so that cliffhanger caught me by surprise. I can't see them being killed at the start of next episode though, so it'll probably open with a shot of their bodies or Gomie dead and Hank gravely wounded. They're outgunned and can't have much ammo as they were only expecting Walt. Indian police turning up? Meh. The Nazi's have Walt over a barrel here (lolz) so I don't think they'll be content with just the one cook seeing as they have to wax 2 DEA agents. Maybe they cut a deal and everyone walks away? Haha. We'll know who the BFG and ricin is for by the end of next episode methinks. The next episode is supposed to be the best in the entire series according to Vince. Oh, and the scene with Walt Jr and Sual was hilarious.

Loved it though, and it seemed to last longer due to the way it was shot. Intense as ****.  Spoiler I didn't notice they were a neo nazi group. The way Todd was shooting had me cracking up so much for a scene that was meant to be intense as ****. I think everyone expected Hank and Gomie to be goners so that cliffhanger caught me by surprise. I can't see them being killed at the start of next episode though, so it'll probably open with a shot of their bodies or Gomie dead and Hank gravely wounded.

We'll know who the BFG and ricin is for by the end of next episode methinks. Honestly, it would be have been even more amazing had they ended the episode with Hank and Gomez dead on the ground with blood over instead of randomly cutting it off like wtf? And yeah most likely they will open up the scene with another flash forward and/or after showing them both dead. It would be bad writing if they are not dead. I think most likely jesse managed to escape from the car and hid behind a rock or something. The rifle is most likely for these guys + lydia for the shitstorm they've created. very weird that todd kind of likes Lydia, she is attractive but who the hell likes a godamn weirdo like that lolz. The next episode is supposed to be the best in the entire series according to Vince. Oh, and the scene with Walt Jr and Sual was hilarious. saul is always hilarious. And damn I wonder what will happen next episode that will constitute as the best episode. I think there is the point where walt actually leaves to get to the point where he was in the flash forward eating breakfast. btw  Spoiler i think marie will take revenge by killing skyler or something blaming walt for and whatnot. combinng spoilers plus quotes is harder than reading a pured post.

 Yeah the Aryan brothers have have chapters/gangs in most prisons so they were good candidates to do the initial hits on Mikes men. And there's a theory Marie is the one who trashed their house in the flashforward lol. Might as well leave these here. Episode 5 spoilers obviously. Damn, had forgotten how patronizing Dexter could get when it wasn't being lame as ****. Stick to season 1, 2 and 4 children. http://i.imgur.com/B8d7dX3.jpg http://imgur.com/gGxNO5Z http://i.imgur.com/ryGn6Xy.jpg http://imgur.com/RahA1MY Hope that Jane story comes back up. Was half expecting Walt to blurt it out when Jesse spat in his face! 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Vince was right, best episode till ****ing yet. MY REACTIONS COUGH  Spoiler OKay, first of all I didn't expect hank to die after, I thought he would be already dead in action. obivously he would die, but the way he went out was extremely sad. "you're the smartest person I know" it was sort of respect towards walt even though he really wanted to capture him. Man that was sad. I knew right from the godamn start when Marie told skyler to give up (since hank has him under custody) that SKYLER WOULD BE A GODAMN RETARD. WAlter junior is also a bigger retard and walt just had to make a run for it after he looked he was going to kill skyler. he took the blame fully when he talked with skyler on the phone for hanks death. The threat to skyler about how anyone who crosses him was mostly just a bluff to kind of teach idiot skyler a lesson; Holly will obviously get back to her house after the fire department identifies who the child is and skyler is going to realize how stupid she is for what she did. God skyler is an idiot. I want to punch the tv everytime she does something. MY PREDICTION COUGH  Spoiler Once the baby gets back in the house, this is where the next shitstorm continues. Marie goes bat **** insane after hanks death and tries to kill skyler and I think succeeds. Walter junior kills marie and then procedes to kill himself. therefore, the flash forward of the 3 dead bodies happen. Either marie or walter junior will write heisenberg write on the wall. They probably all get together to trash the place or something. AS FOR JESSE. this might be weird, but right at the moment when jack was going to kill Jesse he saw two eagles together. I THOUGHT HIS WAS DEAD FOR SURE. The two eagles together in the sky I think are a foreshadow to him joining forces together with Walt for the last time. Jesse is going to beg for forgiveness to walt and probably the same the other way around. Most likely though Walt will rescue Jesse from slave labor as he m16's the entire gank. Jesse is going to be like why save me? walt will say "cuz you're family" revised prediction  Spoiler Okay, there aren't 3 bodies, there are two. Which makes me believe that it's brock and Jesses gf. They are probably looking for jesse or whatever and they go to walts house to ask him about Jesse. Bam the two bodies cuz shitstorm this flash foward didn't happen already did it? the ending is too godamn unpredictable. See george rr martin? You don't have to kill 80 percent of the cast to make it unpredictable you just need plot.

 Yeah, after sleeping on it, probably the best episode. The structure was kinda touch and go especially the opening (a flashback) and then sorting out last weeks cliffhanger with what is one of the most pivotal scenes in the entire series. Basically the point of no return for Walts soul. Really brave to have it so early and then..... what follows.  Spoiler so the Jane thing came up again. So petty of Walt and you almost see the bile in his words. Won me a £50 bet that. Jesse will probably get best supporting actor, but damn, Dean Norris as Hank killed it. In fact everyone owned in this episode. Hell, even Holly stole a few scenes lol. Walt Jr finding everything out was another thing I hoped we got to see and boy did the scene not disappoint. I think this is the last we'll see of the White family. I'm guessing witness protection for them. That phone call was another amazing moment in the series. Loved the not so subtle homage to Scarface in the dialogue. Next episode is called 'Granite State' which is the nickname of New Hampshire - where Walts based in the flash forward. I think this is where we see him change his mind and go back for paybacks. People are talking about the gun but the bag he has looks like it has more than just money. We know he can build bombs. Next episode is gonna be monumental. It should lead up to the flashforward. I'd like to see Walt go full Heisenberg one more time. PS  Spoiler I thought they might get Jesse to cook but not the way it happened. I would've expected Meth Damon to die in the crossfire and then the nazi's taking Jesse as their b1tch. Works much better the way the show handled it. And damn, Todd is so unintentionally hilarious. 'Sorry for your loss.' And your revised predictions suck zer0. EDIT 2 EPISODES LEFT!!!!!ONE!!!1111

 Glad I'm not the only one who thinks he looks like a meth'd out Damon. 

 Damn son, did you go on a meth + Breaking Bad bender to catch up? I'm definitely watching this from start to finish within a month of it ending. I have the first 2 season dvd's but you know they're gonna come out with a proper blu...meth ray boxset. PS - looks wicked on blu-ray.

Either that will happen or he tragically finds Jesse dead. and yeah todd is literally hilarious; laugh every time at that gif too. the scene with the phone call was probably a way for walt to put the entire blame on himself and kind of just let skyler get away with things. He took holly thinking she was the only person not against him but even she was against him at the end lmfao. next episode is going to be off the scales. I'm going to need therapy after the two last episodes. 
 wtf worst ending ever. That was absolutely horrible. absolutely no need for this episode to be this long. It better be that he is saving the past for last cuz there was no intesnity in this episode like compared to the last two. Still, I don't doubt the ending will be awesome.  Spoiler **** YOU TODD. Killing Jesses gf was ****ing cruel; always knew there was something off about this guy jesus. I was so happy I thought Jesse was going to escape. Vince cilligan can't let jesse just be tormented and die after that. And I don't want them to be against each other. I want Walt to save Jesse and kill the nazi doucehbags. 
 Todds such and *******!  Spoiler And honestly Lydia needs to go! Mike of course was so right about here. You saw how her and Todd were talking about Skylar, because Skylar saw her at the car wash. And you knwo how Todd said not to worry about it, I have a feeling she's goign to put a hit out on SKylar or something. That *****. OH OH and **** Todd for killing Andrea, Poooooor Jesse mann. Ugh I can't believe this, and they just left her body there?! so her son is going to find her body? on Weds, they're going to have a marathon of every episode up untill Sunday of the final. I cannot wait. 

 Amazing ending to an amazing show. At first i didn't know what to think of it. IT sort of left me with a feeling I couldn't exactly find the world to describe. It left me bittersweet if anything. The entire episode progresses slowly to its ending, which you can kind of see how it will go, but yet all the same you don't want it to end. It left me craving me for something more out of the ending. But anything more would have ruined the show and made it unrealistic. It was very bittersweet and I kind of hated it at first but the closure of every character made me really like it. There was no other way to end it.  Spoiler I also thought he really hired the best assassins to scare of Gretchen and her weirdo husband but i loled skinny pete came out and the handed over the lazers where as everything probably thought it was a sniper rifle. Jesse being saved I kind of saw that coming. Vince should have read my mind and added the line from my prediction "why you saving me ?" "cuz you are family". The machine gun was also a sort of like the last genius thing that heisenberg did, as **** yeah *****es. That was like a batman moment there holy crap. pure genius. One thing I didn't like was near the end.  Spoiler i still felt like there was no farewell or goodbye from Jesse and walt. You could tell Walt wanted a final goodbye to jesse after all they've been through, but jesse left. I don't like this bad tension that they had there. I wanted them to leave each other on good terms. I think I might need therapy after this .

I wanted them to leave each other on good terms.  Spoiler Pretty sure they exchanged some very understanding looks as Jesse got into the car. I don't think they left on the best of terms, but still not bad terms. 

  Spoiler This was a perfect ending to the show. Walt and Jesse's moment at the end was a symbol that on some level, they are back on good terms. Walt was somebody in Jesse's life he couldn't find anywhere else. Every time he tried to connect to a person he ended up either losing them or being pushed away by them. His parents didn't want him at all, his friends were all drug addicts and losers, and he lost girlfriend after girlfriend. When Walt admitted that he let Jane die I'm sure Jesse hated him more than anyone else in the world, but the nod at the end was just the way of saying "we're OK." Walt was the worst thing that ever happened to Jesse, and Jesse realized at that point that he would never have to see him again. Walt did everything in his power to undo all of the harm that he brought to Jesse at the end. Unfortunately one small plot hole is that while Jesse can escape the compound, he can't escape the police. Walt may have died in that laboratory making it seem as if he was cooking all along, but Jesse's prints would be all over the place. Giving Lydia the ricin was perfect. I was so happy to see her go, and Todd had to die too. I will miss this though:

I was so happy to see her go, and Todd had to die too. I will miss this though:  Spoiler I think initially walt came in with the intention to kill everyone, including jesse since he thought he was helping out with their business. Once he saw him in that state i think he changed his mind. The car invention was freaking epic, another genius. They compared him to the unabomber, that's interesting because the unabomber was a scholar himself. Jane was a good riddance if you ask me. Walt was more of a parent to him than his real parents ever were. Yes, he's done some bad things but he did saved Jesse on numerous times, and even when he talked to Jane's dad at the bar he referred to him as a son asking for advice on how to better help him out with his problems. Jane was manipulative as ****, and they weren't going to get anywhere in life using that money to just keep getting high on heroin. She was better off dead. I'm pretty sure he was mad but not as mad about poisoning brock. Jane was sort of out of his life at that point; the gf that todd kiled though was the saddest. I will miss this show. 
  Spoiler I though the ending felt kinda rushed and by rushed I mean it felt like they put 2 or 3 episodes all into one. Even tho it felt rushed though it was still a very good ending. What I liked: - The moment with his former partner was epic, Walt putting bagger or in the brush with a laser pointer haha - saving jesse - jesse being like **** you at the end not some little ***** like oh thank your for saving me. Jesse asked him if he wanted to die and when he said yes he let him live just like **** you douche bag if you wanna die then I won't give you that kind of peace - the way jack thought the money was a bargaining chip and walt just smoked him in the head because it does not matter anymore - that gun rig was awsome - tod getting choked out like a beotch - That they ended it not stretched it out like they do with so many series and movies until they are ruined. What I did not like: - The stivia death seemed a little bullshit like your gonna get the ricin in a closed back at the right table at the right time and yes I get she is a creature of habit still personally I did not like it. - that Marie did not die because omg I hated that **** through out the entire series - that Skylar gets off scott free even tho it was the best bet, like marie i hated skylar she was such a whiner - That Walt died from a stray bullet caught from his invention. It was good and i don't know why but I just wish it would have been more personal then an accident. Even with all my likes and dislikes of the final episode it was still epic and a great wrap up to a great series and I will definitely be watching it again down the road. 
 It's all over and I'm heading out the door, don't know when I'll be coming back. Thank you to all of the members of the Breaking Bad team This was the greatest drama series for television I've ever seen. 
  Spoiler The only thing that really bothered me was it never tells you what happens to the White family. Do they get the money he blackmailed his friends for? Skylar has to be an accomplice and they never said if she went to jail or got off with a slap on the hand. She was handling the money they have to know she knew. Though she could have claimed he forced her to or something. Well the other thing is where is Jesse going? I really imagined him driving off a cliff or something not on purpose or maybe so because, he has nothing to live for and he's most likely going to jail. He has to I mean come one. I agree with the statement above his prints have to be all over the place. If Walt had blown up the lab I could see him maybe having a chance but, he didn't which also surprised me. All in all there was a lot left untold. I liked the ending and fond it fitting I just wanted to know what happened to everyone else.

  Spoiler No I get your stance but the final minutes seemed to suggest a brighter future for all. Vince Gilligan had even said in interviews that Jesse gets away and is free. Less is clear about the money but they wouldn't advance the clocks and show us what happens, it ended with that scarface esq shot of Walt who had the world and didn't care if the people in it loved him or not and that was the best way to end the story. Anything is better for them now than what they had anyway. I actually wanted a different pic but settled on that one for time, that or a good angry Mr. Bean pic

It was a fitting ending but, maybe just not the one I expected to see. I didn't hate it but, didn't love it either. Still, the whole series was worth watching for sure. I would never say the ending killed the series because, it fits.

 My post breaking tress disorder is kicking in, I had a dream last night/this morning where in some universe Hank was leading the drug world. He was in some dilapidated home with baggies for every addict walking in the door then in another unconnected world I'm standing in the woods in front of a pretzel stand to get two pretzels when somebody from my high school class named Josh White approaches me from behind and says, "Mike's closing in." Anyway there's all that. 
 'NO REPLACEMENT FOR DISPLACEMENT.' Nuff said. I also really dug his visit to Elliot and Gretchen and his two scenes with Skyler and Jesse put him on the road to redemption. Still, ambiguity kinda goes out the window when the other guys are child killing nazi's and....Lydia lol. Thank you Vince Gilligan and I really really hope Aaron Paul is in something else decent in his career. At least Cranston got Malcolm In The Middle, which is even funnier when I catch repeats. BTW, Meth Damnon? Yeah, in talks for role in new Star Wars.... Man, 'Better Call Saul' can't start soon enough (November!). Its in the same universe so I really hope we some old faces. I's be gutted if Dean Norris/Hank doesn't have at least one cameo.
