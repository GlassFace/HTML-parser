 Dubstep
 So what do you think about Dubstep? Do you like it? Do you hate it? Would you prefer other music genre? Would you even call it a genre? Is it nuisance when you hear it?

OT: Before Skrillex's name gets mentioned: Here is some Knife Party (it's best if you play this at 720P HD, if your computer can handle the badassness of these wub wub wub basses) And as the gender-confused adopted daughter of 4chan & Tumblr that I am. I need to embrace my inner-autistic, obese womanchild and blast some Brony Dubstep (AKA Hoofstep).

 I am beginning to pick up an interest in Dubstep It use to be a vague interest, where I would only listen to it for about 5 or 10 minutes then develop a headache. Now I can listen to it in a more stable frame of mind. Don't get me wrong, I like Skrillex, but I believe he is over-rated, when there are many more talented Wubstep artists who are often ignored.

 I never got a headache while listening to dubstep. It was probably you were not use to it before, but now you can tolerate them drops! When I ask people which dubstep artist you like? They keep saying Skrillex, because Skrillex is the only one they know. xD Yes, your'e right skrillex is over -rated. Benga and Skream, Flux Plavillion, Vaski, Bassenectar and Datsik are artists that you can try to listen to

 I grew up listening to alot of Hard Dance and heavy metal so my taste does flow between variations of the two but this is one track that I listen to occasionally: ...and here's another on the same mix CD:

 Sorry but I like music not **** though this new "music" has drastically improved my view of other "music" often known as rap. Really it has only made me realize things can always get worse. 
 Dubstep > Rap (post 2004 rap at least) Don't insult Dubstep THAT bad, it is a harmless genre.

 Well it is debatable as to what is harming the youth today but since something is harming the youth and the youth do seem to be more into such **** as dubstep we can not conclude that is harmless. It could be said that there is no conclusive evidence that it is harming the youth of today. In rap's defense, though it may fit your time frame, there is at least the existence of good quality rap where no such thing exists for dubstep.

 I only like a very select few. Its hard for me to dance to it, I cant do the style well - Im more on fast movement, its like the opposite. skrillex, knife also the andain promises, I like the myon and shane version I often hear this music in sex-oriented clubs here in LA 
 This thread is bad and you should all feel bad. Burial or gtfo. 

 Yeah people, we should feel bad. We like music that isn't acceptable by another person who believes that his canonical acceptance of music is the universal law of the land. We must like only what keefmaster (AKA the only person that is nearly as infamous as I am with constant name changes) likes and disregard what he sees as 'ignorant genres or scenes in music.'. Let's just ask a mod to close this thread, and go listen to an underground garage band.

 I think it's pretty good but I don't listen to it as much as I do with other genres. I like rap slightly better or reggae, dependent on the artist. Obviously it's a genre. It's a sort of music (AKA a genre). Depends on the artist. You seep pretty hateful of dubstep, lol.

Also, that entire post has no credibility, coming from someone who felt the need to just take a **** on "post-04 hip-hop". I don't even know where you pull crap like that from. And here, good dubstep.

Currently listening to: SULK - End Time I wanna fade out. 
 Yeah, this sh1t was atrocious, save for the Temper Trap one (good find) and what Mummified posted. He forgot Hudson Mohawke but no ones perfect. I grew up on jungle and drum and bass and I was under the impression dubstep would die out once dj's got bored dropping the bass every 0.5 ****ing seconds but no, apparently its here to stay. Forever. I love it when its a part of something else. An excellent example is the best dance tune from last year..... Jazz, horns, trancy bit, bluesy vocals, wub and the drop. Perfection. If you want to listen to good dubstep check Mary Ann Hobs show on radio 1. Obviously I can't stop you listening to complete and utter tripe but I can at least try. I'm just nice like that. Unlike these other hata's in hurrr. http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006wqb7 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Haha! I gotta admit that there are some funny comments above and I think people aren't looking at the bigger picture. First off comparing Dubstep and Rap is like saying "What taste better? Apples or Oranges?" They are two completely different genres and the people that like them appreciate that choice in music due to different reasons. When I was younger I listened to a whole range of music and many people that I went to school with loved their Rap. 2Pac, Eazy-E, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Ice Cube, Eminem and even Ruff Ryders. Some of it was interesting and I didn't mind Xzibit's "Restless" album but as a genre I don't find Rap engaging as a genre. Now Dubstep is something that I feel more comfortable with and that's because I am a huge fan of the Electronic and Dance genre. I first started off with the Prodigy and that interest moved into Daft Punk and Pendulum but more importantly DJ artist like Amber Savage, Special D and Brooklyn Bounce. So you can see where my interest in Dubstep comes from as it's more of a branch off in what I currently know. The other and more important point is that people don't actually realise how old the Dubstep genre actually is. Oh Snap is on the right lines when he was talking about Jungle and Drum & Bass but Dubstep started in the late 90's. Now someone could easily turn around and say that Rap is an older Genre but you gotta remember that back in the 70's when rap started there weren't any electronic devices to mix music the way that it can be mixed today. Even The Prodigy when they started in the 1990s were way ahead of their time. So far in fact that appeared at a concert in Denmark, 1994, with an all rock line up and they were the only ones that produced music electronically.

 i have never officially listened to it but from what i have heard it sounds horrible but it is quite popular it could even replace rap as the most popular music genre in a few years. i hope it dont because even though i hate rap from what i have heard of dub step it seems even worse but im just going to have to listen to it to find out.
