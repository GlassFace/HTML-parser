[Personal Life Discussions] does anybody believe in love ?
 I believe that love once existed but is no longer in our era . Do you believe in love ? Are you in love right now, perhaps a crush or a bf or a gf ?I've had one crush .I never pursued a relationship though because things dont always work out the same way in reality as they do in animes .even if I like someone now I'd prefer watching them from a distance. Yeah ik im a masochist 
 I believe in love. Love is a beautiful thing when you meet that right person who just gets you. But then again, love can get ugly if you get your heart broken. 
​
 I believe in love. It's like a drug that takes you on a trip that you never want to end and when it does it leaves you with an emptiness you feel you can never fill 
  Spoiler  Spoiler 
 (I don't want to scare anyone away with another massive wall of text again so I'll be brief.) If this is about marriage type of love - I believe in that love, but I don't think I will find it. Life just gets in the way too much and people seem to demand more and more for their "soul mates". If it happens, hurray! If not, I'm fine with it. Spousal love isn't the only kind of love though. I love my friends and family and that makes me happy! It feels nice to know people appreciate my company. 
 I believe in love. It's cute in all forms, and yeah, it could work out. But I'm not interested in pursuing a relationship. I'm scarred at it might not work out, or my bf may be a creep, or any other violent thing my head could think of. And if I do somehow manage a relationship beyond marriage... babies.

 It does exist. But you know its a choice. You can be attracted to someone but like people have said before, you dont go full love as in you don't go full retard. Seriously love blinds. Also +1 for Ian's video

 I don't understand. Why is it necessary to believe in a feeling? It's like asking, do you believe in hate? Do you believe you can hate someone so much that the mere sight of them makes you want to bite your tongue? Do you believe there is someone in the world who you will hate more than anyone else, and that person is the only person you'll ever hate with all your heart? Well?

 Funny you mentioned this... Today I was at the shops and I'm a frequent shopper at some dude's shop and he was talking about the quality of love and ****. He said back then people got married and loved eachother tillthey died, now everything is about money. He used his gran parents as an example, and his siblings. I told him I agreed, and also have my family as proof. But you will always have those people who find eachother and it truly is about lasting love. But in general, I believe it's getting much worse.

 But people married for money back when too, that was kind of the point behind a dowry. 

 Are you talking about selfish romantic love, or are you talking about compassion love? There is certainly not enough compassion, but too much selfish love. I am always in love, but I do not pursue it. I am 80/20 against relationships. It is too much work, and there is not much to gain. However, that is also because I have not find anyone suitable. The worst thing anyone can do is think he or she needs love or relationships to be happy. Compassion, on the other hand, can never be enough.

 In the past there was a much greater stigma surrounding divorce, pressuring couples (women primarily) to stay together even if they weren't terribly happy with each other. Today we're quite a bit more free to do as we please. Freedom is a good thing, Pured, not a bad thing. lrn2Amurka

 Yeah, I believe in the romantic kind of love. Haven't really experienced it yet, but one day....

 I believe in love, but not scripted movie type crap. It has ups and down, and not all love goes somewhere. 
 Of course I believe in love... for fame and money muhuahaha! Ahem. Yes, I do believe in love, and it is more than just being in a relationship with someone (platonic, romantic, filial, and maternal).
