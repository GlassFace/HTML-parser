 Yasuo might actually be a little more balanced if they reduce the time of the cc on his ult. You sit in the air for like 2 seconds it feels like in which time the entire enemy team wombos you. Also reduce his crit damage maybe. Takera no one cares that you double posted since the first one was on the previous page. That means no one will read it. 

 High skill high potential champions like Yasuo are always a huge problem. I understand that Riot wants to release high skillcap/high reward champions, but they severely underestimate how quickly the playerbase will pick up on them. It makes me feel like these champions will always be necessarily overpowered or necessarily underpowered. I mean, take Shaco for example. He was the OG high risk/high reward champion and for the longest time playing against him was considered autoloss. Finally in the end they nerfed him past the point of playability, basically. 
 ^^ That's the whole problem with this game. Well and item balancing even though I think it's gotten a bit better on that end.

I mean, I can't imagine any champion who was never overpowered, but I think the high skillcap ones were always the most difficult to balance. Zed, Jayce, Shaco, Lee Sin, Vayne, Orianna... yeah, they all range between broken and nope.gif. 
 umm hi I'm new to the site and I also play LoL so I thought I would check this out I'm looking for new people to play with so yea 

 Anyone that can explain this? I don't understand how I can handicap myself and still have done the most damage to champions in my team. Is it because I hit skillshots or is it because my team misses all theirs?

We are just 'one' within the 'all.' But only when those 'ones' gather together can 'all' exist. - Edward Elric. 
 The thing with high skill cap champs is that the community will eventually get good enough to use them. At that point one of two things will generally happen (and happens in other games as well): The champ is simply too strong when used at maxium efficiency and must be nerfed.The champ is overly complicated and others can do the same thing with less effort and less margin of error. Both of these things have been happening for years and years in the Street Fighter community. Akuma used to be a lot stronger than he is now because back when he was finally made playable most of the community hadn't used him before (the OG's could dick around with him in SF3). When the community figured him out and became consistent he was obliterating people. He had to be nerfed. Conversely, a character like Sakura, who has a ridiculous execution requirement in order to use her effectively, isn't much stronger than any other character. To compete with other characters with more forgiving timings you have to be razor sharp, not a great thing to have to worry about during a high-stakes tournament. Why pick Sakura when you can use other, more reliable rushdown characters like Cammy, Yang, or even Ibuki? Paul showing up makes me wonder how often this happens in DotA2.

 HAHA Dunkey is a king. Watch this video for true op showing. 

 Guys I just... I don't know how I did not flame this game, but, this person right here, thought going Lux against Jax top was a great idea, I thought Rengar was top and she was mid at first, so I went in Yi jungle, turned out they were stubborn people who just made me go Mid Yi. It went great for me, and well, you do not need to ask what happened to Lux, she was 1/3 20 minutes in and claimed she won lane, oh dear lawdy lords, good thing for me Fiddle wasn't so great at the game so I was able to tie the lane, I'm getting better at not flaming people, in chat. I still don't know why she wanted MR against Jax, it was basicly lost from the start, oh well, nice try I guess, but Lux is way too squishy of an Ap to go top in my opinion. Can I get a treat for being nice today please?  Spoiler

 Well don't expect to see me for a while except vs AI. My CPU is so messed up these days. Gotta go buy a new one.

I mean, talking **** to bads is hilarious, but if it actually affects your play it's a problem.

Hmmm, nope, maybe I should actually do so, I know I lowered it a little to give it less attention and still see it if someone just calls mia and doesn't ping it, yes I've faced this a couple of time lately, but I guess won't hurt to try and drag it off see how it goes.

 I can see the difference with a chat I can read and one I don't pay attention what so ever, here's another outcome of what has been happening lately with my plays, I didn't flame and just kept on making a tie in my lane while being camped, it was actually a challenge, until Kha tower diver into my stun, the game was going great at a certain point and then it proceeded to the other just doing what they wanted to, I've tried to make calls such as baron, but they went for dragon and blue, 45 minutes in, it would've made us win, but nope, the enemy team got there while I was waiting with my friend. I've tried to carry this, but it was just impossible since everyone just went all over the map and only grouped when they were close to base. I also go a penta in like, 3-5 secs, I was not expecting this what so ever. What ever, at least I can win my lanes and keep on controlling myself, I'm starting to become a little better of a person on League.  Spoiler

 If your w/r is not even 50% I dont know why you think you can talk ****. Not that with 50% you should or that makes you "good". But you aren't even winning half your games and you seem to be hurting your team more talking **** and not even 50% so I see no need to talk ****....

 Yeah, uh agreed normals don't really challenge all that much compared to Ranked Q till you get 50% win ratio + I have a 60% ratio and my opponent vary from plat to diamond. downside is that it gets really tryhard when you just want to try something new. I suggest keeping your win ratio in normals low if you want to have fun.
