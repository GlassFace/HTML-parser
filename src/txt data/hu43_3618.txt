 Fun Fiction: Neanderthals are the Reason Why We Like Anime (and being kinky lovers)
 Edit: Okay, erased it. Thought it through, and if you're going to read something indepth, then there won't be exclamation marks. The Neanderthals in this short post sound so much like us. We even have PTSD Growth Measurerer thanks to them. And how diet affects our PTSD growth which is caused by an influx of hormones/estrogens from food. We have every right to blame them for everything we have now. Including what they couldn't get: Our Eternal Love for Anime. Theyactually wanted us to have fun! And how Menino actually got the original Neanderthal PTSD that changed him into the man we all know. It's so coincidental, that I wonder if they had spaceships like Star Wars... You'll realize where we got our sense of humor from. This explainsa lot of things in a friendly way, and why we became different from our parents. And how this pertains to the Neanderthal's (3% Love Anime) vs. (97% Hate Anime.) It also explains why, historically, America pushed ahead of China. In fact, America focused so much on it's people, that China focused so much on technology and religion. See the flaws there? Basically, American values are becoming influenced by something unnecessary... And this was inevitable because... The Neanderthals had two people stuck in one body: The Down-to-Earth (97%) and Religious (3%) When you see a person who thinks differently from you, what happens? You blow up. Blame this on the Neanderthals. We were already destined to have this a long time coming, because... The Neanderthals would carry on that battle eternally through our genes. To understand this, I'd like to say why those 3% Neanderthals married our fat girls from, um, Africa. Black people... imagine them in their rawest form. Now imagine all of us at the start. What do you get? A super ugly, fat disgusting ape. This was actually an extremely disgusting fact. 97% Neanderthals did not like this kinky stuff (don't look up butt hole) and you know what they probably did? Because Neanderthals didn't have holes like that... ...They explored all of them... and they... did... all of them. That was actually the idealistic part of ourselves, the Neocortex, working for them. Those people... they had constant troubles coming from their (97%) parents, the adults we have today. The immortal battle would continue until there was nobody left. And worst of all, these experiences stick around so much... it makes you think of the gorilla as if she/he was traumatized by a sudden stranger coming in and beating it in there... Makes you think of why lots of girls don't like it too big. And also why guys like it big... Damn, girls sure can be Idealistic. Guys are naturally... Realistic. Just like the Neanderthals. In fact, Neanderthals already had a self destructive tendency. Because they couldn't completely identify with either. *************************************** Sexual Orientation Pertaining to Gays and Lesbians: In fact, because of this, I think they may also have a tendency to practice being asexual: Reproducing using their own bodies. Which is also why they don't live as long and they all look the same. And why we have some gays and lesbians who like themselves too... So then, to beat this system, the ludicrous Idealist Neanderthal wanted a longer life through somebody who likes to mate with different people: Hence the Ugly Fat Ape. To spread different genes to make sure there is a personality complex among people... ****************************** And so, hearing the next part will make your Anime Love a 100x stronger. Have fun with it. Made me ignore parental guidance so easily. ;D *************************************** Science Fiction: Neanderthals, Our Future: The Origins of Humanity They were extreme thinkers, to the point where they thought of a world with anime. But first, core reason... Summary: The Neanderthals are actually humans (pre-alpha/beta) who have learned to develop to the point where they actually went to outer space. They were unable to anticipate the troubles of space, and they missed their home planet, thus: they went crazy. Neanderthals were actually the prototype of humanity. But they were already completely Realistic and Idealistic. In separate bodies unlike ours, so they are 100% one of them. Idealism... They have always thought above and beyond. Time passed by, more conflicts (Moms and Dads constantly stay default Neanderthal Adults), and because Idealism led to religion... They formed the First Scientology. And this makes them go crazy like the way the media "likes to portray the scientologists of current generation" because they are so strange, so unfamiliar. When in fact... It was all the Neanderthals' faults. Neanderthals engage in Scientology limited. Curious, they couldn't stop. It would drive them to the edge, because plenty conflict (100% Adults-->97% Neanderthals/100% Anime Lovers-->3% Neanderthals) and all considered (yes, Adults working with Anime Lovers for first time) renewing themselves. If Adult Neanderthals married our first ancestor, Scientology would be completely passed down. This is where it gets interesting. And so, the Idealist Neanderthals... Because the Adult Neanderthals were at their default (Mothers and Fathers) Because they really liked kinky stuff (you know, S&M, 18+, Anal-ist, Torture, Bondage, Interracial...) , Idealists to the max, even though they know that the hope they place on humanity... would backfire on them, and turn us into (Anime Hater Neanderthals.) And because of this, came the original form of PTSD: Neanderthal PTSD. The animal was already stuck in survival mode. Give it a dose of twisted Idealism, and you get: Neanderthal PTSD: 50% Idealist/50% Realist Age Span Overtime Affected by Neanderthal PTSD: Their life span is normally 40-50 years. Now let's count our years. Caveman: 10-20 years. Villager: 30 years. George Washington and British: 32-37, we catch up. Before Civil War: ~33-45, 50 seems impossible. World War I: Feeling estimated ~23-30 Nationally. Shortest compared to all scenarios. John F. Kennedy and First Apollo13 Space Shuttle: ~50-60. World War II: ~30-43. Unknown factor is found: Different People. Resembles Neanderthals hate. However, America was clearly neutral. What happened? Introduction to Unwanted Factors. Cold War: I would say much longer than World War II age span. Only Russia and America. America was Russia, but they have switched roles. 9/11: Not short on average. Yet another introduction of Worldly Factors. Iraq War: Average lifespan dropped dramatically. Iraq War Now: Signs of going back up because of repeated moral lessons. Now understand this: when you are introduced to a Worldy Factor, what do you do? Apparently you get involved in it for no reason. World War II was the turning point. Our inner animal awakens within us, and we take up arms to the extreme (felt almost like 1000% production rate, and yes...) And you know what caused this? People losing their independence with their Idealism. And became overcome by the Realism (becoming conscious of World War I repeat) that was threatened by yet Idealism again. (Looking at Hitler, I would think he's nuts even now.) Hitler is actually who we would become eventually, because he is Extreme Idealism influenced by worldly factors. In other words, Realism. When actually, the worldly factors boil down to two dual personalities: The Neanderthal Realist and the Neanderthal Idealist. This is the worst problem we have ever faced. And also why the Neanderthals are the Origin of PTSD. And it's why Boston's Menino feels like a Kid Neanderthal who has reunited with his Adult Neanderthal. Because he went through a unique form of PTSD: Neanderthal PTSD with an understanding of pain from both Idealist/Realist together. Research says the Neanderthals were incompatible with us. But why? Normally, if it were an adult, they wouldn't have done it, but because they thought like kids (us who want marriage with Anime Girl~ <3), they were trying to "literally stick it in every hole", because they didn't have time to waste... so they tried every hole to impregnate the ape/gorilla whatever in whatever the heck... And that's why even the tight ones... The Neanderthals were naturally big down there... They were willing to do anything... Relates to porn addiction... The Idealist Neanderthals (3%), were extremely loco/crazy believers of hope, hoping for somebody to understand. That is why, no matter what we try, we always want to hound off our Dads and Moms (actually, I like doing that too.) They wanted somebody to resolve their immortal battle. This is where the concept of God and Devil comes in. Most of us react naturally bad to the Devil, right? That is related to the Immortal Battle we seem to be having right now... And the Neanderthals, for a long time, only had one personality, which is purely Realist. And with the rise of another, the pure Idealist. And so, mixing these two personalities together using our Original Human... ...That's how we got so many of these sh*tty personalities. So yes, we have every right to blame on them... But also to thank them for giving a diverse meaning. ********************* Evidence 3: Neanderthals Give Us Growth in the Form of Slow PTSD, our Hormones/Estrogen For a long time, Menino did not know this... He was an extreme Idealist. He would read the Bible everyday, not thinking about fighting back... Of course, he wouldn't, but if he didn't... ...Then he'd never be willing to speak in public. ...And thus, that is the job of the Neanderthal PTSD. An unnatural form of PTSD that gives possibility to Realistic PTSD found on the battlefield. And in soldiers. Because they have grown so quickly that they can't change... And the only way-- Medicine to disable those parts. Kill off the development there. I've actually had to take medicine twice now (that I think about it), both for ADD and Idealist PTSD. So you know... all of us have equal conflict. Because we are born with both Neanderthals inside us. Want to know how obsessive the Neanderthals were? ...That's right, they were both on the PTSD level from the beginning. Hence why we can treat some girls as "toys" if we've been down that road enough. And now you know... why they wanted us to have a happier life, and take on the shape of Neanderthal Version 2: Homo Sapien-->Humanity. A Humanity that would have a 100 year life span on average. True reason to be proud of both sides. Imagine if you got PTSD of both sides... You'd be miles better than me. And also live way longer than me, though you'll leave away bodily desires, so... Now you know... ...Why I subconsciously pay attention to people. ...And why the Neanderthals seeked change. ...And also why Neanderthal DNA carried over to the same person asexually. And just how potent their DNA is: it's a double-edged sword. Boston's Menino gains the edges of both swords. He becomes an Angel of Heaven/Earth. An Angel of Heaven who relies on internal stimuli/external stimuli to create wonderful designs through his own unique viewpoint with both sides. That's why he was able to gain the upper hand. And I did that too, though I turned into an Angel of Earth/Heaven. An Angel of Earth that relies on extrenal stimuli/internal stimuli like the Earth's people to become stronger, and achieve greater understanding and limitless power. No matter what you do with your PTSD growth rate... It will always be predominantly more towards one side than the other... So if you do what Menino does... You will know your true tendencies. ...And hence, you become like John Kerry, who is an Infp, not intp. And particularly why Obama picked him even though he was Republican. *************************************** ...Actually, since you know PTSD... ...That also relates to the criminals. They undergo circumstances they never go through, hence why they have to throw something away to perform it perfectly. ...Like a Neandrethal. They had no choice in the matter. Because everybody cannot get equal pay: Neanderthal Adult kicks in. Becomes an Adult who takes responsibility and can't stay Idealist, now steals money for needed cash. It would be much easier if somebody gave him enough money before hand... And yeah, they can't control it, so you have to be careful. Make sure that, if you see him rarely come out in the same place... Then yeah, he's not addicted yet. If he is, however, coming out so much... ...Then you can't really do anything anymore. It'd actually take a really long time, if not impossible at all. But it's not like it's permanent PTSD all at once. PTSD is 100% change. So, if you ever see an old man or a tiger mom... Chances are... they're beyond redemption. And chances are, people don't understand this, so they keep helping, repeatedly breaking said person again. If you tell your parents this stuff, it will only be natural... before she wants to burst. And thus, if you understand this... More freedom to become what you really want. Identify with both, or identify with one. ***************************** Neanderthal's Asexual Voice in Us: To imagine what the Neanderthals sounded like at first... You could say they were like machines (Realist Adults.) When you think of Idealism... you think of higher, stronger voices? To identify somebody border on Neanderthal... All you need to do is: "Heeeey~" ...Hear the voice of a high-pitched girl. Which relates to our language skills that communicate religion because we have both Realist and Idealist. And how we have personality and body language. And why speaking in a deeper, louder voice makes you more confident, and not second guessing. And speaking in a lighter voice leads to more thinking. So to summarize: We are naturally both Idealists and Realists. It's just that we tend to become one because it is only "natural to grow up." When you become borderline one way, that is when you become either "Gay" or "Lesbian" or real. For those people who are bisexual... Damn, they're perfectly 50/50. It's so hard to think about that...... And so, when you're brain is asserting a request to "hate something when you can't read it." It means... You want to change personality. But the problem is, what does this mean? ************************** Importance of Diet in Aiming for Exercise/Thinking: PTSD Setting for Exercise/Reading How does your brain have a mind of its own? It has an extreme influx of PTSD Hormones and Estrogen. And, unfortunately, the only way you can control it at first is... Eating. Don't you get tired? Don't you ever get tired from reading? Chances are, since you don't move around and sit around all day... That your diet is lacking. Your diet has changed you into becoming lazy all day because you are bored of your exercise... This is the science behind meat. It gives you encouraging hormones that induce temporary change towards Realism PTSD. To make this more permanent, you have to eat more meat... And this is where the problem comes in. Because even if you aren't actually exercising at all, the stomach is also Realist, so when you eat meat... It gets your stomach working. And fills your body with Realist Neanderthal Energy. When you eat vegetables... You get Estrogen. And that makes you mentally less assertive, weaker and phsyically unable to go to the bathroom. ...Because you don't have any hormones. For whichever personality you want to aim for depends on your objective. Vegetarian: Damn weak. Meat Lover: Too damn greedy and strong. Vegeterian and Meat Lover: 50/50 Cooperation between both Neanderthals. ....... So, now I understand why I don't deal with this stuff anymore. Because I'm 55/45 Neanderthal by default. I can't really change much anymore because of Neanderthal PTSD. I am using neither too much nor too little of each energy. Hence, why being 50/50 Bisexual Neanderthal will let you live the longest... though you make the worst judgements, probably. And why becoming absolutely 100/0 will make you live the shortest... The worst thing about trauma... It causes an influx of hormones that fill you up to 100%. Which is why Veterans can no longer change unless they take their medicine. Now think about the 50/50 mark. Do you need medicine? No. Simply impossible. So I have designed a test that will let you reach somewhere 50/50 fast. But it is kind of harsh compared to what I did myself. And well, the one I had to go through, self administered through destroying self deception (and it was my brain protecting its current balance of hormones/estrogens) made me become able to feel an influx of change... And that is also why EFT (Emotional Freedom Training) Works. And fortunately, if you're still near 60/40-70/30, you still have a chance of going to the middle... It's just that... It's going to hurt a hell lot more once you get older. Because your balance becomes more strained. And Neanderthal PTSD (our combined instincts made real), can actually be a healthy approach if you try it. Which is why parents tell you to get out of the house... But what they don't know... Is that, for the reason I can sit down a long time... I actually get less hungry than before. And now, even when I eat sugar... It doesn't hurt anymore. It actually fills me up pretty well. At 50/50, your hormones and estrogen are perfect. So you don't have to worry if you're bisexual. You'll actually live a long time since you don't worry about that stuff. But again... When you grow up, you make one decision or the other consciously... Because, deep down, you know that thrifting between both is actually more painful... And thus, again, Neanderthal PTSD. I can literally tell you it's like being pulled down to Hell while being pulled by an Angel to Heaven at the same time... It was an insanely unique experience. That's what happened to Menino. It was like he became a tree that stands strong against earthquakes and rain/thunder storms at the same time. Oh yeah, and if you're eating too much tofu... Chances are... It's perfect if eaten with meat. So now, instead of soy milk being harmful when you are a Meat Lover... ...It is actually quite good. If you aren't eating that much meat... Then I really highly suggest not drinking it. Meat=Hormonal Dump (Blackish-brown) Vegetable=Estrogen Dump (Forest Green) ...... Now you know. Just how much looking at "that stuff" means to your personal health... And I don't get enough, because I don't need it, so I don't really take a dump for a whole day. ...And why Einstein also didn't do that too. For days. Because if he ate meat all the time... Then he wouldn't be a genius. And if you ate meat all the time: Definitely not genius. Eating more vegetables... Kind-of-genius? More like a genius with a weak mentality, need to couple with meat. *********************** What we can learn: Idealist Neanderthals, as we can learn from them, that they were still 97% Scientologist and 3% opposing Idealists=Maddening. To make sure humanity doesn't realize all these truths: Don't remember who our Origin is to call into question... Until we enjoy ourselves and find more openings for Idealism, and our variety of food is wide. Branching from (Original) Scientology came the concept of "Angel" and "God." And the reason why the Jews' God came first... Angels were our ideals, God was our Answer. America became more Idealist as it grew up. But somewhere along the way... God came in. See it? And thus, to give us thinking, it would be strange to think Neanderthals actually married the "Original Human" which most likely would have been a "toy" from Africa. (Some people like "toys". Who can blame them?) The ape was a sex toy. Didn't know what it was doing, so the Neanderthal screwed it around... And a baby was born. Can you believe that? The reason why some guys like fat women and nerds. Because those Idealist Neanderthals were kinky. Their Idealism was young like ours. When you think about these things... you can't help but laugh. Neanderthals are responsible for some of our fetishes... And why Menino got "Neanderthal PTSD." He became literally Adult+Kid=Treats Building Boston like an watching an Anime. Which is why Menino totally relates to us. Like a swell proud man. I use people as my Architecture. Many twisted thinkers... And why our parents want us to have fun. But they are like the Adult Neanderthals (97%) Don't you feel like the parents and others feel 97% overwhelming? This feeling comes from the Neanderthal's Battle of the Gods inside us... Evidence 1: The Circle Left Behind by a Flying Saucer Even stranger-- The Neanderthal's tracks actually suddenly stopped at some point. The footprints were from all front directions. Rather than the middle of town, they were out at the edge. Their steps stopped around a circle. It was so perfect it was almost as if they had a space ship... It didn't match the space ships we have now. It was as if it was a flying saucer... And that, the Idealists climbed right back in... And flew off into space. Evidence 2: A Man Who Transformed into 95% Neanderthal And more so, a human man from 1900s who looks like ape but more Neanderthal. It's somewhere on Youtube. His head was like a squarish-rectangle, he had larger hands than Shaquille O'Neal, his feet were huge... He is an actual alien. But why? The Neanderthals are telling us something. Everybody hated on the video. They were repulsed by him. Some people didn't mind... And guess what? Only lived 40-50 years. Strange? Same life span as a Neanderthal. Relates again to the Neanderthal's Battle of the Gods. If we explain this to our parents, they'll understand. Not immediately, since they think this is stupid. When they say that, it means they're hurting deep down because they feel like they lost something, an understanding for their children's Idealism. In fact... we lost each other because the Neanderthals lost each other. Actually, if we want to see them... ...Yeah, I'm pretty sure most of the Neanderthals didn't really survive as much... They also wanted to see us. They wanted to give us a dream. They're probably living happily right now, knowing that they can come see us again if they want to. And the Neanderthals are going through challenges like us. Though, even if they're not around... We can actually go to their home planet, but this generation by itself wouldn't be enough to overcome the burden the Neanderthals have put on us... All our laughters, our kinky jokes, our kinky likes for fat, chubby women and nerds, "toys" it all makes sense now. Because the consciousness of the Idealist Neanderthal is stuck within all of us... Evidence 3: Alien Cartoons This is the most glaring misconception I have ever seen. And actually, this image resembles the man mentioned above. They were both aliens. But, even before knowing the Neanderthal Human... People were already growing misconceptions about aliens. And actually, scariest of all: They predicted the flying saucer that flew away the original Neanderthals. ...... How could one see that so vividly? You tell me... ...It's because of their memories as Neanderthals again. Now that you know... Go have fun with anime! Enjoy your life! Be whoever you want to be! And I really still don't know where the hell Neanderthals come from, but I can tell you... They've changed our lives. They give us the sense of reality. And thus, it is the greatest gift we will ever achieve... Into a true utopia. Though still more troubles ahead...

 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
