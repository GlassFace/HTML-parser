 Rare Lunar Eclipse Tonight!
 Skywatchers around the world are gearing up to observe a rare total lunar eclipse. The best viewing conditions for the eclipse are from North and Central America, parts of northern Europe and East Asia. Astronomers say the Moon could turn a pink or blood red hue during the eclipse, which begins early on Tuesday morning GMT. It will be the first total lunar eclipse in three years. The Moon is normally illuminated by the Sun. During a total lunar eclipse, the full Moon passes through the shadow created by the Earth blocking the Sun's light. Some indirect sunlight will still manage to pierce through and give the Moon a ghostly colour. The west coast of America will see the eclipse start on Monday night; observers in North and Central America will be able to view the whole event. Total eclipse begins at 0741 GMT on Tuesday (0241 EST on Tuesday; 11:41 PST on Monday). http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12042984 NASA is also hosting internet chats about it and streaming it live here: www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/watchtheskies It should be a spectacle and a half, permitting the sky doesn't cloud over too much.
