 Ansatsu Kyoushitsu got an anime? When is Until Death Do Us Part going to get one? Anyway, there seem to be a few interesting ones I would watch, such as Seiken Tsukai. Sequels are always nice, especially Aldnoah.Zero and Jojo, but the rest seem to be rather generic, such as Juuuo Mujin and Absolute Duo. Eh well. I guess I will have to wait and see. I am most amazed by the fact that Tales of Zestria is getting an anime before the game comes out.

 For a second I thought that was Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell. Tsunemori ain't no Kusanagi. Point blank and period.

 Looking forward to Ansatsu Kyoushitsu anime. 
 Amusing coincidence that Kan colle and Ars nova movie in the same season. The only thing that let me down is still no K MISSING KINGS MOVIE!!!

 I think I'll still cut back on new shows. I did like seven or eight in the summer and I just couldn't enjoy them as much. I'm just doing log horizon, sao and selector spread wixoss right now. I'm doing a completed series in between. I still have some from earlier this year I want to get to. I have tons of older shows still on my list also. Durarara 2 will be on my radar for sure.

 Dog Days got a third ****ing season? Monogatari Series is wrapping! New seasons of old greats like Durarara!, Aldnoah.Zero, and Tokyo Ghoul! I won't be making assumptions now, but I'll see what piques my interest with pilot episodes in the future.

I won't be making assumptions now, but I'll see what piques my interest with pilot episodes in the future. Wow we've the same to-watch list! Yes, Monogatari novels are ended n we'll get there soon. Originally Posted by J4sm1n4 I know... I was waiting for that movie since it aired in summer but it's still not online (T.T) ****!! Yeah I went diving for torrents last month and didn't even see the raw version at all. But instead I gotten Berserk 3rd movie and Kara no kyokai finale. Natsuki chan thank u for the news! Didn't know that and pleased to know. The Japanese are looking forward to Ansatsu, which I think looks pretty generic. But may worth looking in if the manga is that popular. And I've question about jojo series. I've only watched the older seasons looong ago (up to end of the Star beating the World) and now I wanna continue to the one above. Will it connect? Or should I watch the 2014 one first?

 Wow, some good anime coming up I see. I can't wait!

 I've never been able to keep up with anime that just coming out...if that makes sense? For instance, I have a hard time keeping up with the newest Sailor Moons. I need for the whole series/season to be out in order to watch it.

 Tokyo Ghoul season 2 is about to be turnt good lord. Durarara season 2 has given me a reminder to finish the second half of Durarara but honestly without the first intro the ANIME IS RUINED XD.

 Only series I'm looking forward to is KanColle... Why? Because nothing gets better than watching moe-moe anthropomorphic adaptations of WWII war ships that belonged to the IJN (except for moe-moe highschool girls battle each other in WWII battle tanks [Girls und Panzer]) ...  Spoiler I am, however, worried on how they managed to pull this off. Because if you were to analyze what KanColle originally is, how do you: 1) Describe in detail (and not managed to confuse your audience) that the girls ARE IN FACT personifications of war ships and yet they live normal, human lives on land 2) Animate/describe how the ship girls act in an idle scene at the naval base, a traveling scene towards open sea, and a combat scene without making it extremely uncomfortable for the audience? EDIT: I just noticed that the animating company in charge of the KanColle anime project is the same one who did Noucome, Mondaiji and Squid Girl... I feel sorta reassured :P
