[Anime] Death Note Ending Questions *Spoilers*
 Yesterday, I finished watching Death Note and I had some questions about the ending. Honestly, I don't think I completely understood what exactly happened at the end of the series and how everything fit together. I thought they explained it too quickly. Â Spoiler For example, what exactly did Mello accomplish by kidnapping Kiyomi? Why was it significant that Mikami had written Kiyomi's name in the Death Note in addition to Light? So, basically all Near's team did was switch out Mikami's Death Note with a fake? Or was there something more they did that I didn't catch? I'd appreciate your responses. I'd also love to hear people's thoughts on the ending in general. ...And one more thing is the manga worth reading or is it exactly the same as the anime?
