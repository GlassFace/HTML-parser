 Anne Rice's Prince Lestat
 So this book just came out the other day. Are there any Anne Rice fans on here who have purchased this book yet? I can't wait to visit the city to get my hands on it! Normally, I'm not a large fan of vampire novels. But I do love Anne Rice, her books, and Lestat. <3 No one I know has really heard of her, which is upsetting (I'm more surprised no one knows what Interview with a Vampire is).
