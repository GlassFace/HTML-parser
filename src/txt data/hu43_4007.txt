[Anime] Scare the s**t out of me. I dare you.
 Elfen Lied is one of my favorites. Not for the plot, but just for it's "I don't give a f**k" mentality. The feeling that anyone could die at any second was lovely. I only jumped once the entire series though, and I even knew it was gonna happen. It gave it an element of realism that you just don't get in any other anime. AoT was one of those type anime. Almost every series in existence, the main character and his/her friends are basically immortal. In AoT the only person who is immortal is Mikasa. Even Eren could die at any moment. That sort of suspense is what made me love them. And I have yet to watch an anime to be psychological/gorey/scarey enough to leave the images stuck in my mind.. Any help here? I need to find something that would really affect me. Now you gotta remember. I'm the kind of guy who watches Elfen Lied and laughs. Or who watches Another and gets bored by it. Who watches Death Note and hopes that Light wins (Not to say I'm the only one). I want you guys to think of the scariest, most messed up, most psychological, action thriller anime that you've ever watched. Now please keep in mind, I'm not a fan of Demon/Exorcist/Vampire, so if at all possible I'd like to avoid those. Anyways, I dare you guys to try and scare the **** out of me. After I've watched all the suggestions, I'll probably announce the one who scared me the most (for those who are interested). Though that might take me a while because I watch genre's according to my tastes that week. The person who suggests to me the scariest anime wins. So go wild, and don't hold back. 4xdblack (EDIT: Maybe this should have gone in Transcendental. Oh well, YOLO)
