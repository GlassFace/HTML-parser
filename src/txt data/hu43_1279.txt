[Slice of Life] FREE!- Iwatobi Swim Club (aka Swimming Anime, aka Tumblr's baby)
 The story revolves around Haruka Nanase, a boy who has always loved to be immersed in water, and to swim in it. Before graduating from elementary school, he participated in a swimming tournament along with his fellow swimming club members, Makoto Tachibana, Nagisa Hazuki, and Rin Matsuoka. After achieving victory, each of the boys went their separate ways. Time passed, and in the middle of their uneventful high school lives Rin appears and challenges Haruka to a match, showing Haruka his overwhelming power. Not wanting it to end like this, Haruka, gathers together Makoto and Nagisa once again and brings a new member named Rei Ryugazaki to create the Iwatobi High School Swimming Club in order to defeat Rin. Read more at So it all started with this  Spoiler A commercial that Kyoto animation released.. Soon after it's released, Tumblr dubbed it as "swimming anime," and the reason it received so much attention was the fact that it seemed geared more towards a female audience (unlike most anime), due to, cmon isin't it obvious? how "Hot" these guys are. There was a soon a petition made, for these characters, to receive a show! These characters became super popular overnight( they weren't even characters,) Canons were created, many fanfics, stories, fan art EETC! Animation Do released a splash image for a new project in April 2012, which was followed by a television commercial for the project in March 2013.[2] The commercial quickly went viral among fansespecially users of the blogging site Tumblr, who quickly developed a following around what they dubbed as the "swimming anime".[3] Despite only being a 30-second commercial, a wide variety of fan works expanding upon the nameless characters from the ad were created, including hypothetical biographies, art, and fan fiction, along with online petitions calling on the studio to turn it into a real series and Finally, Kyoto announced FREE! and the reason why it's one of the most anticipated animes of the summer is because it will more than likely cater to females. So pretty much tumblr willed this into existence, I was there throughout the whole ride. The Yaoi fan girls have been going nuts. But I honestly hope this is not a yaoi, Which I think it won't be. Although there could be under tones. I think it could just be a comedy about a bunch of guys friends in a swimming club at school, who just happen to look very good. I myself am extremely excited for this show. The first ep comes out today, or tomorrow I think. PV1:  Spoiler PV3:  Spoiler PV w.e tf # it is.:  Spoiler Gahh I forgot to put the genre. Wish I could change that. EDIT: Ok so after trying to find to see if this show is based off a novel or something, it seems that it is. Free! - Iwatobi Swim Club is a Japanese anime television series directed by Hiroko Utsumi and produced by Kyoto Animation and Animation Do. The basis for the anime is a novel titled High Speed! written by Kōji Ōji, which received an honorable mention in the second Kyoto Animation Award contest in 2011. The anime will begin airing in July 2013. So perhaps Kyoto was going to make this in anime, and after they released the CM for their company, the popularity of these characters arose, which then influenced them to go ahead and green light the show. Interesting.

 Yeah, this is going to be K-On but judging by all the promos they've released it's going to look damn nice.

 Ive always wanted something like this to come out!!!!!! WHEWWWWWWWWWWw 
 This anime didn't seem bad to me, I actually liked the first episode. It kind of reminds me of Bakuman with the rivalry between Nanase and Rin, I'm looking forward to the rest of this show. 
 I feel super gay for watching that but the story is interesting enough to keep me watching...it's just so gay XD.

 @Mo: it's funny cuz I know for a fact that when girls watch the anime where the fan service is for dudes, no girl thinks "That's lesbian " haha. I guess girls are just to desensitized to the objectifacation everywhere lol. If it truly makes You uncomfortable, just Don't think about it so much lol

 XD I was watching the first episode with a guy, we were fanboying/girling over Haruka's hair flick >A< WAAAAAAAAAH. AND THEIR PROFESSIONALLY FAST + DRAMATIC STRIPPING. ERHMAGAWD <3333 
 
 Uwah, DAT SOUNDTRACK. Like wow I'm getting Kuroko no basuke flashbacks, except this music is even cooler? Anyway, it's super pretty, and the character drama is fairly competent: and there's pretty guys. What more could I want? 

 @Kile: I too was thin king about that soundtrack! haha I am able to look over the yaoi undertones ( I can't stand yaoi) @Mo: Don't derail the thread from the topic. Go look in Anime genre forums, I' sure you can answer your question there. 

 I'm pretty much watching this for KyoAni, but holy crap. It's actually pretty good and interesting. Of course, I picked up the fact they all had girly names, and thought that was pretty funny, but, seriously the manservice is fine, it's not like it bugs me or anything. Gou-chan is pretty sexy too, btw. 
 @ShikinamiDesu You can also find me on Hummingbird! 
 I'm finally watching the first episode right now, and I almost got scared off by the voice acting in the first scene. Got weirded out by how they all sounded pre-pubescent, but thankfully it was just a flashback to middle school for the anime. lol

 Finished the first episode and I'm not understanding why any guy would call this gay and yaoi. The fanservice is really casual and light.

 The new episode!!!!11!!one!! I was kinda confused as to why Mr. red frames hadn't appeared yet. Next episode! Really liking Nigasa... <3 He reminds me a lot of Honey-sempai, who was my favourite in Ouran. 

 Haru Nanase (I think is his name) is my favorite so far. I love how his love for the water is so transparent despite his slight "whatev" attitude about it. lol Also, Miss Ama-chan is a really cute and funny lol

 Hate to say it but I am warming up to this anime. It's interesting to see a natural vs hard work type of situation. Looking forward to the next.

 Still enjoying this anime, even with all the man service, at least Gou-chan is there so it's not weird.
