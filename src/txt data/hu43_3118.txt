 After College Relationship Question
 HI, I use to go to this forum many years ago and i am glad that this website is still on here. I remember meeting some cool and kind people on this site and i was wondering i hope to meet more again now that i am back. Having friends in college was a great thing to have, its been so difficult now back living with my family and parents house. The town i live is so small, i miss the connection i once had with friends from College. I am a nerdy guy, but with a very open heart about things and open minded about many topics about life. I am a musician and composer of music, a photographer, a artist, a computer graphics artist that one days wants to work at a video game company and also in the end become a director of a motion animated film or a live action film. I have always loved final fantasy games, the stories that are in there were amazing. I am just wondering if anyone feels that some people just never find that person that can understand the way you wished they did, not just from the physical side but the internal side of a person. I just sometimes feel stuck in the limbo area wishing i could just open up more to people that would be okay in wanting to get to know me more then just what they see on the outside.
