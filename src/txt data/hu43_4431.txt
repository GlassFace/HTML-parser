 RIP Monty Oum
 It's always a shock when someone young passes away from something that should have never happened, or something trivial that shouldn't have even been able to take his life, so it was so sad to hear this, especially since my bandmates and I love RWBY. He inspired many elements of our band, so we wanted to make a little tribute to him. We recorded a medley of songs from RWBY, including This Will Be The Day, From Shadows, I Burn, Red Like Roses and Mirror Mirror. Here it is if you'd like to check it out. RIP Monty, you're already hugely missed! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o3Q03spukQ
