 Video Game Recommendation(s)
 I don't usually like RPGs. In fact, I could list every RPG I have played right here; Pokemon Blue, Super Mario RPG, Shining Force, Final Fantasy VII, Grandia 2, Final Fantasy X/X-2 and Jeanne D'Arc. My favorite ones from those are Grandia 2 and Jeanne D'Arc. What I liked about Grandia 2 was the battle system. Although, the game's story is average at best, the battle system is still one of my favorites. I liked that the battle system felt involved than other turn based RPGs, like FFVII. For example, in Grandia 2, you could cancel an enemies attack if you timed your attack correctly. What I liked about Jeanne D'Arc was the strategy involved in the game. I also liked that it wasn't too complicated to learn how to play the game. I think that's part of the reason I don't particularly like RPGs. They can be a little overwhelming to learn how to play. Anyway, if any one could recommend me a game that might be similar to the ones I listed? That would be great. Oh, and just so you know, I own an Xbox 360, PS3, and a PC.
