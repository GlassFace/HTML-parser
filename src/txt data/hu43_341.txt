 Reflections on Fun & Games
 I apologize that I'm a bit late. So, I'm looking over the numbers. There has been no significant change in activity. People are now heading over to General Non-Anime Discussions AND our Anime and Manga forums more often. There has been a significant drop in activity in the Video Game forum (it is now ranked BELOW certain user profiles and PLD). ---- Based on our Forum Software: Active Users capped at 975 last month (dropped to 890 on the 30th), and it is currently at 975 for the first week of May. Let's see if we can produce good content and topics to get that 975 to 1000+. We haven't been at 1000+ in over 2 years.

It often comes as a surprise, filling the heart with sudden Joy. Selfless and giving, Love places the Happiness of another before one's own. It inspires with its Passion, nurtures with its Generosity, and enriches with its Spirit. There is no limit to its magic. Love is Eternal."
