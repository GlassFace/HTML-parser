 Hi everyone ☆ My Trip to Japan ^^
 Hi☆everyone ! ^^ I live in Finland. Been watching all kinds of anime series Boku wa tomodachi ga sukunai to One Piece. Try my best to develop my manga drawing skills year after a year. Still pretty bad. ｡>▽<｡ My passion is also SASUKE " Ninja Warrior " training. Here is video for my first trip to Japan. Happy if you like it (^▽^)

 Welcome. That was an awesome trip. I like Monkey Park, That was a lot challenges pretty much packed into a narrow alley. Good space utilization.
