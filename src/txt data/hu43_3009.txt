 Must See Magical Girl Anime Series
 I was wondering what do people consider to be must-see series in the Magical Girl genre? Why do you consider these shows a must-see? Personally, I have only seen about 3 magical girl anime series; Madoka Magica, Mai-Hime, and Sailor Moon, but I did enjoy the ones that I have seen.
