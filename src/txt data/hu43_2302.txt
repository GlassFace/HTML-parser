 Seinfeld
 I'm going through it, got it for super cheap and it's got me belly over, still all over the place with people who either loved it or hate it but both must agree Michael Richard's physicality on the show is, well here's a reminder. If I make a list of my favorite moments I won't have any time to watch another episode so soon, another day. 
 This is usually what's on in my parents house for a hour after my dad gets home from work. Even in syndication for over 10+ years it's still the best thing on my cable tv. I personally love the show especially Kramer and Costanza I think your right for the most part you either love it or hate it. And for me as far as sitcoms on my cable I'd have to say of the top of my head Seinfeld, Married With Children, and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia are my favorites. 
 There are people that hate Seinfeld?! 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 I don't hate it but after watching 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' it is hella dated. Plus Kramer is just retarded now. Both character and actor irl lolz. Costanza is where its at. Not seen it in years but I'd watch if they started repeating it again. Beats ****ing Friends. As in the show, not having sex with your friends. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Dunno I could never get into Seinfeld. I think Jerry is funny and some parts are funny, but I cant stand watching multiple episodes in a row. I do love me some "Curb" though, god, please Larry. BRING BACK CURB

 I loved Seinfeld and still watch from time to time, but yeh, I'm gonna agree with TonyTony when saying Curb Your Enthusiasm is ****ing god-tier. I've seen all the episodes about a thousand times over. 
 Over played, Seinfeld is still on daytime channels always if you have satellite, has been since the last episode, I can't watch it anymore because of that. Back in the day it was a great show, funny, and had everyone talking each week, but now it's a dead horse that's being kicked. I don't watch the re-runs now because there's always something more new and better on. 
 no matter how much they replay it, i can always spare 20 minutes for some Seinfeld. Same with Malcolm in the middle.
