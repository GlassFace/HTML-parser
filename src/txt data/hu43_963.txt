[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 I can't believe this episode of Valvrvae... it ended on a HOPEFUL note, with understanding between all the characters! Not shock and despair, but hope! O_O I'm sure that'll all come crashing down once the next episode starts, lol... xD Â Spoiler
