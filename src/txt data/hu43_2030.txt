 Shadow Fox Cocktail (beta Version)
 Here is something I am making, Its in sort of a beta version right now. Let me know what you guys (hopefully adults old enough to drink lol) think. I am trying to think of a good cocktail I can make my own but I don't think this drink is strong enough just yet. Rocks Glass (the one Below High Baller and above a shooter! You know what you put whiskey and ice in.) Toss in some Ice. Depending on Size if they are the long shaped ones about 4 will do ya. 2oz Vodka...I think that is how much I put in. 1oz Orange Rum Two parts Grape Juice One Part Pear Juice. What do you think? How can I improve this? Should I just opt out the Orange Rum for a stronger normal rum or maybe toss in something else? Amaretto or maybe Gin?
