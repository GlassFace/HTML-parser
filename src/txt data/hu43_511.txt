[OOC] Glass Academy for Inhuman Beings - Page 89
 Alright, are we going to bring Glass Academy back up or not? Because I am really confused and check once in a while XD 
If we make it back to the real world. Ill find you again. And fall in love with you again.~Asuna, SAO "Lets accept each others weak points; love that touches one another is invincible; we who bloom are the protagonists" ~Tamaki, OHSHC' Thanks so Much to Takera for the siggy! 
 @Myameohmy Yes, we are finally picking up again. Rejoice! SO when ever your post is ready, have at it. @Cheshire With your new changes, your character is accepted, keep in mind though that the school does not take crimes against students lightly, so be conservative of his power usage. Also, he is able to be an english teacher if you wish. ***ATTENTION ALL Glass Academy STUDENTS AND FACULTY. ATTENTION ALL THOSE CONSIDERING TO JOIN Glass Academy*** Due to the lack of activity that we have been experiencing as of late, all new members from this point forward WILL NOT be allowed to join Glass Academy until such a time where our current players have returned to a consistent and reasonable posting schedule. We recognize that issues can and do arise in real life, and that any breaks due to these issues is understandable and will not be held against the specific player. That said, Cheshire, we fully expect you to be active, and if your inactivity reaches a certain threshold, your character will be removed and not allowed to return. I hate to be more strict on you than our other players that have stayed longer, but Glass has had too many people join and quickly become inactive. If there are any questions, please feel free to ask.

 ^^^ And that is proof Randoms is extremely bad a**! I can't wait ! And I promise that I will have a look at the IC and make a post within a couple of days most likely, I hope. I will fully admit that I have been a lazy butt and taking advantage of having a winter break to not do anything. But I will have a look and post soon .

 Good idea Randoms! We should def get things back in the motion before we start accepting new things. And no no problem mya. 

 Okay...sorry about up and disappearing for a couple days. I've been logging in to check up on things, but that's all I've really had time for what with the semester starting up. And on that note, is it okay if my activity is something like 3-4 post a week? With my Senior Thesis, on top of all my other classes, this semester is gonna eat quite a bit of my free time unfortunately 
 
 Well I'm here, though I'd have to check where Raph and Autumn are atm 
 Alright going to be looking through post tonight and will try to make a post by tomorrow night, sorry had competition and some finals to study for this week.

 Alright, I'm finally back. I'll probably be posting here soon.

 Welcome Back Har! I'll post after you. Hope everyone's semester is going well 

 I'm doing pretty well, except I'm completely blundering my Digital Art class. And yes, that post'll be up soon. Edit: Also, I was considering making another character, but I wasn't sure. It might just make things more confusing and difficult.

 Well, it is short and doesn't have much of anything new in it, I will think of more later. But right now I knew I needed to get something up so there is something now. Sorry it took so long.

 No worries Mya, It's a good post regardless. At the moment, I am just glad that you posted. lol Keep it up 
  Spoiler 
 Well, that post took a depressing amount of time to complete. I haven't done any writing/RP in months so I'm kinda rusty... gotta get back into the swing of things. Oh, also, Mya, I was wondering if you wanted to have Caedis and Namine meet up in their shared dorm soon-ish?

 Don't; worry harlequinn, your post if fine, well written might I add. 
  Spoiler 
 Finally got something up...damned school work is already being a hassle despite only being two weeks into the semester haha. Lemme know if I should change anything. I tried reading as much of the back logged stuff as I could so hopefully I didn't mess anything up. 
 
 Great post, Cheshire. I look forward to seeing more from you.

Thanks, I'm just happy to doin an RP again....and that I'm not too rusty to actually participate haha Originally Posted by Randoms Cheshire, is the girl at the end Elizabeth? Just confirming if it is. Yep, was struggling on finding a way to get some character interaction going when I remembered your last post 
 
 At some point, I still have to have Namine and Kelaras meet up at some point also soon which makes it a bit difficult.

 Ok, so autumn is with Kelos. Has Danny posted on that front and I've missed it or am I waiting on that? Also Raphael is... God knows where. I have officially lost Raphael. I'll just reboot him if I'm not with anyone 
 I don't think Danny has done anything with Kelos yet, and you are free to reinstate Raphael where you need to.

 Silence fills the air!

 Well, looks like it's silent again. Aside from me needing to make a post soon for Cheshire, who are we waiting for? Cheshire. I will have a post up in the near future. 
  Spoiler 
 I can make a post, I was sorta waitng for Force but that's ok! I can do something with Kelos, and I'll update on Kelaras.
