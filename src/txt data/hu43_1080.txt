 Read this before posting or risk getting infracted or banned.
 When posting about anime series, especially new episodes in particular, you MUST use spoiler tags or blackout texts. To do this, you can type [.spoiler]text here[/spoiler] or [.blackout]insert something[/blackout] without the periods. If you think someone is posting a spoiler, please either report the post or take it in PM. Don't post about it. Seriously guys, just because these materials have been released before doesn't mean people should already know.
