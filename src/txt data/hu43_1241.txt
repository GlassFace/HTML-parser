We felt that we wanted to raise him up a Tier. Guybrush's Moderate Thread ability has now been increased to 100/200/300/400/500 from 1/2/3/4/5Guybrush's Ban User ability has been increased to 1000 from 1/2/3/4/5Guybrush's Move Thread ability has been reduced to 1/2/3/4/5 from 2/4/6/8/10. We felt that this was a bit overpowered and needed a nerf.KT Samurai has been a very powerful Champion in the past and with our last balance changes, we nuked this amazing Champion into the ground. With these adjustments, we hope that he'll be a very viable selection in tournaments. KT Samurai's Post Awesome Threads ability has been increased to 9000 from 1/2/3/4/5.KT Samurai's Banhammer ability has been increased to 1000/2000/3000/4000/5000 from 0 at all levels.KT Samurai's Do A Lot of Stuff ability ratio has been adjusted to 1.5 from 0.9.Shian has been reenabled and is now a selectable Champion. We felt that now that we're done balancing this Champion and fixing his BBQ Sauce problems will make him a usable character. Try him out and give us feedback!
