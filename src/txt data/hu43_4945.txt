 Dressrosa Arc
 Kyros and Violet won't be joining the crew. I have my doubts about anyone here joining the crew, I mean we have Law and that samurai guy still hanging out with them, plus Usopp just got Haki so yah...I was hopeful about Rebecca in the beginning but it's apparent she won't be joining even if asked. You also forgot about Luffy asked Jembi back during the Fishman Island arc. he accepted but wasn't going to join them much like Vivi. As for the Fanboy, I bet hell be around for another arc before he splits from them. For me the most likely to join might be Law himself or at least keep to the alliances with Luffy after these events.
