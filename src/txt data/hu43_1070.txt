[Personal Life Discussions] open relationships
 Have you tried it? Ever thought of it, wanted it, asked of it? If you have, how did it go for you and your partner? Did it work out or no? If not, any reason why you wont? Would you feel bad if your lover of such from you? 
 I think this ideal. To be open and trust your partner enough to not need to check on them. If they want to be with multipul partners, then so be it. Though I don't think it's for every one.

 A friend of mine is in one. Honestly, I don't think it's working well for him. Every time his girl wants to sleep with other men, it tears him up and I have to be there and help him get back together. I have no idea why he keeps trying to do it if it obviously isn't working. As for me, well, one would have to have had any sort of relationship first before considering such a thing. And let's be honest, I have never had one and knowing my luck, never will. So, it would be a foolish thing to consider if I would want something I can never practice.

 I have to agree with BlackElement, for me there is no need to do it, a relationship is about trust with one partner, not many, that's why it works.

 i agree with Blackelement. Open relationships aren't for everyone. I never was in that kind of relationship , neither I'll ever be. I don't like the idea of sharing your partner. I see it as a waste of your time and completely pointless or as a whim (or being just bored). I prefer one partner without 'loitering around'. After all, I am not a greedy person. One partner is enough. = * . * =

Mo, we have to work on your reading and comprehension abilities. I don't see a problem with Open relationships. But I can't comment too much on it as I have never been in one before. The idea doesn't seem too bad though.

 Totally not something I'd ever consider. I know people who have done it because their relationship had pretty much run it's course and they were trying to hold onto it by "seeing other people for a while." It never works, and just ends up with someone getting hurt more in the end. Usually in that case, one person is just going along with it because they don't want to lose the other. It's best to just break up on good terms and cut the emotional ties, rather than making things worse by involving more people. Of course there are people who go into it while still in a strong relationship and it works because it's what they both want. I am maybe a bit of a romantic in some ways and I would never cheat on someone. This would feel like cheating to me, so I couldn't stay in a relationship with someone who wanted the best of both worlds. I'd probably just let them go if they felt that they needed other people to make them happy.

 Yeah, they work for some, but not for all. It's kind of a half-assed commitment to one person, so I never really saw the point of agreeing to an open relationship unless your profession is to have sex with people for money a la porn, prostitution, James Bond, or Indiana Jones. I just kind of see it as casual dating, but not "steady" dating. edit: I'm not saying that I'm against casual sex, or casual dating. I'm mostly just arguing semantics.

 Well to add, this is not one sided; You yourself have the freedom to pursue others - girls, and well guys... to an extent, where one guy (you) can even be in bed with both women. Also, I can understand the frustration of some, as Ive heard it before. It is not really fair since women have it so much easier in finding a partner for this, where as men, though they have the freedom, cant find women as easily. Like a woman could have been with 5 men and the guy zero. One experience of mine with it, I asked my ex-bf for it. He said yes. I didnt sleep with anyone ok, but I let a guy kiss me. He was sooooooo furious and called me a cheater. I think it traumatized him. LordDarkton Has he expressed his misery to his lover and asked her if maybe they can put this arrangement on hold? 
 I have no problem with other people doing it. Whatever makes you happy. I of course could never handle one however, i'm the jealous, territorial type. IE I'm a prick.

 Originally Posted by kurona LordDarkton Has he expressed his misery to his lover and asked her if maybe they can put this arrangement on hold? I do not think so. He just lets her do as she wishes because he wants her to be happy, but feels miserable doing so. And he also does not go out and find a girl himself like she goes out to find a guy, which since they are in an open relationship, he has the freedom to do. The odd thing is, early on in their relationship, he told her about me and she wanted to sleep with me. And he approved because we have been friends for many years and he knew I could be trusted. But then, a few days later, she backed out, saying that she felt that being with me would be cheating. And then, two weeks later, she asks my friend permission to sleep with a guy she doesn't even know because she saw him once and thought he was cute. So, being with me was cheating, but being with a random guy isn't? And since their relationship is open, how can there be cheating, unless she leaves my friend for someone else? It confused the hell out of me.

 I would not even consider an open relationship as I believe it would make commitment very difficult. To me, I don't think you can have A relationship with one person if you have to constantly meet up with other people, strangers or friends. It would be uncomfortable to think that your GF/BF is sleeping with someone other than you, I mean I can't understand how an individual in an open relationship can be that tolerant and completely comfortable with that. Maybe some couples dislike that they only have each other in A relationship , but what's the point of being together if you need other people to keep your relationship healthy? Might as well revert back to single status. That is basically why I would not want to be in such A relationship, but I can applaud the couples who are able to do that. I hope Pinky does not rip my head off XD.

It confused the hell out of me. She did the right thing. Knowing someone that went through this sleeping with a good friends girlfriend is a really bad idea because it can cause a lot of drama in both yours and their relationship . Random people she will likely never see again and have no attachment/emotional ties to them, unless that's what she wants. With you she has no choice. That said she is absolutely doing the wrong thing to him and is using him.

Which is what it sounds like is the case for Lord Darkton's friend. It's best to just break up on good terms and cut the emotional ties, rather than making things worse by involving more people. Yup. Of course there are people who go into it while still in a strong relationship and it works because it's what they both want. Agreed. I've been through the idea until I realized it was just because I wanted to try and salvage my relationship and seeing other people is actually what I really wanted to do. So I cut it off instead. Some people are into the idea and it works for some relationships but it can't be a one sided arrangement -- both people have to want that lifestyle and be happy in it. Otherwise one person just ends up miserable and feeling used. Personally I'm more of a monogamous type of guy, however I wouldn't be opposed to "hall passes" once a in great while so long as no emotional ties/contact is kept up and it's just a one night stand. After a relationship matures it's just not the same as in the beginning since you're so used to each other. There are other ways of curing that with each other though.

 I support harems but not open relationships. I do not opt for open relationships because I am a selfish lover. It is all or nothing. A gamble like that is more exciting. It is also less troublesome with a harem. Personally, I find open relationships to be the same as friends with benefits.

 Originally Posted by Lord Darkton I do .................. It confused the hell out of me. That is weird why she said that, as cheating with you. I dont get the logic there, unless she was confused. It is interesting though, that a guy wants the woman happy right? And then she does become happy. But he doesnt like how it came to be, but he also got what he wanted to begin with = her happy. Must be confusing and hard to deal with - should he be happy or not. I always thought, there is no such thing as martyrs in this world. We go along with things, because in our minds, the good still outweigh the bad or that our primary goal or will, is still being met. He should tell her though, for the sake of being open in terms of feelings and communication. Also, he risks spoiling her too much, and making her think she can do as she pleases - once he says no later on - she'd be too spoiled for it. TO ADD: It does eliminate the possibility of cheating, since what is the point when you are free to do so. It would be abandonment I think if the person leaves, and is different. 
 If both people in the relationship are comfortable with it then there's a mutual agreement so fine, good for them. I know people who've done this and for some it worked and some it didn't. Me personally... nah I just don't find it necessary in my life to pursue such things, I'm not the promiscuous type. What interests me is mind over body. That being said... each to their own 
 Lol I love that I have been mentioned twice in this thread, that's pretty awesome, go me! Anyway, I feel theres a lot to address when talking about open.poly relationships. so I think I'll start with definitions and examples so everyone is on the same page =3 Primary partner/s, usually a spouse or most important partner/s in a group. Often in stable triads, everyone is considered a primary. Secondary/tertiary partners, usually these partners are not as high of a priority as the primary/ies. Usually extramarital partners, or flings, may also be LTR or LDR partners. Open = Sex with multiple partners, there may or may not be a primary partner. Poly = sex and emotional connections with others, these don't always have to be LTR but they can be. Swinging = Sex and no emotional attachment with others, there may be a primary and there are different levels of swinging depending on the people involved. As for myself I prefer polyamory, neither my husband or I are interested in sleeping around, but we like the freedom to pursue a relationship that seems worth our time if we choose. We aren't the jealous types, and we each understand that other people offer, not a better relationship experience, but a different one altogether. We know that as people mature (and we have been together for 9 years now, so that's a good chunk of time) they may want different things from a relationship, and it's not that the other partners doesn't want to provide it, they just may not be able to. Or to put it more simply, neither of us expects the other to be everything we need at any given time. Sure they can come close, and they might fit perfectly from time to time, but to expect that consistently seems a bit unrealistic and selfish to us. Having the freedom to pursue other opportunities takes a lot of stress out of our relationship, since we don't feel totally stuck with each other. Is it for everyone? Of course not, but when it works, it can work beautifully =3 Since opening our relationship we have become much closer and appreciate each other much more because we get to see what other people are like, and what they bring to a relationship. All in all I think it's been one of the best things we have done for each other. Now there are also plenty of really terrible reasons to get into an open relationship, and I think boredom is one of the biggest. It's like having a baby to save a marriage. Instead of concentrating on how to fix, or dissolve their partnership in a positive way, they are adding whole new stressors to the system. Making the whole thing even more likely to fall apart horribly. It's especially bad when people rush into it without setting rules and boundaries first. Does everyone know their boundaries right out of the gate? Usually not, that's something you have to do some self searching to discover, and even sometimes you won't know what they are until they have been crossed. Though fall out from that kind of thing can be minimal if both partners are willing to work with the new information in a constructive way. Open relationships take a lot of work, and communication skills are a huge asset should you decide to try one, and they aren't for everyone for sure, though I'd like to hope I was able to open a few minds with this post and get people to see it's not all about sex, and trying to have your cake and eat it too =3 Feel free to ask me any questions if I didn't cover something you were curious about. Also Just to add, I don't know who told you finding partners for open relationships is easy. Maybe if it's a lady looking for a dude for a fling or NSA deal, but otherwise? It can be just as difficult, if not more so then trying to find a partner when you are single XD

 Have you tried it? No Ever thought of it, Never wanted it, asked of it? Disgusting and a complete atrocity Basically this is the worst kind of relationship possible. Its the kind of relationship a whore, slut and nymphomaniacs. 95% of Multi partner and open relationships are by Bi sexual or gay partners. I do not agree and never will. As many of you know...gonna be 28...never even had a girlfriend or been on a date...BUT if I had to choose between staying this way until I die of old age or a open relationship / Multipartner...cuz its all the same thing. I would choose to be alone and save myself from degrading myself to the level of filth.

Anyways, I think open relationships are wrong not for the two parties involved, rather for the other people you sleep with. It could actually mess them up and if they get attached it could be really problematic down the road. 

 I hear people do this kind of stuff when both partners or at least one, is convinced that the relationship needs a little 'ompfh' in it. Personally - I had hate it, and stressed so much + get so angry if my boyfriend ever considers the idea of sleeping with [when I'm old enough] or just being with other woman and openly while dating me. I wouldn't even consider seeing it as an innovative idea of society and would've jumped out of that relationship quickly​.
