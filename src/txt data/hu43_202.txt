 looks like rihanna, right?
 Well, when they first debuted, I thought she was a guy, you have to admit although she's girlier now she looked freakishly manly in the debut days, she looked like Donghae fron Suju and even said she's Donghae of f(x), it's why she has a lot of fangirls, I feel that she is a confused teen girl, or probably just a marketing thing because most of their fanbase are girls because of her. >.> I prefer Luna. D: very talented and so underrated, she has a powerful voice. 
Thanks for the avatar Amoo :3
