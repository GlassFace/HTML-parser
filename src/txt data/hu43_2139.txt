 Ep 17, don't even know what to say. That ending was just too much. This show just keeps getting better 
 One by one, it doesn't matter who you are. You're gonna die either way. FML

 Ain't that the truth?  Spoiler But damn, that young Akame was something else... And young Chelsea was a Hero of Justice! Then there were random high points... With more to come in the next episode...  Spoiler

 The background music for season two has been outstanding, I cannot wait until they release the soundtrack, it's up there with AOT's soundtrack. I didn't cry or tear up mainly because Chelsea as a b**** for a while...but Bols...he just wanted to go home. A Double spoiler about Chelsea, first one will be about the episode and the Spoiler in side of this spoiler will be about something else.  Spoiler Her head on that spike...terrifying. Also  Spoiler I know where her body is...you dont even wanna know.

She's pretty much a hero of justice, as we saw from this episode (though she wants to be praised for it, of course... she's far from humble). All the mean things she said to Night Raid was because she was afraid of them all dying before her... (oops). She puts on a *****ier front than she really is. All that said though, it was Bols whom I cried for as well. His poor family...

 im kind of mad that bols face wasnt shown. 
"I'll say it once more. I am the mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!"
 Okay, so here I am on Facebook, talking about the screencap of Bol's final moments I posted above, and describing to somebody who Bols was.... while drinking soju. The feels all came back, and I'm crying again. T_T And to think that his last act was one of such kindness, trying to help the little girl whom he had incinerated so long ago. I feel like he left the world in a place of atonement. So here's a memorial to the gentle, loving Bols who just wanted to go home... T_T

 Just saw episodes 15,16,17 and 18...damn I love this show, the feeltrain came by couple of times, jumped on it, felt down and then the characters cheered me up again and showed me some epic action... This show, hands down, deserve more fans. 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 Lubba is nothing but a pervert? Nah, we finally get to see him wreck sh1t. He's true potential is far beyond what I expected.

 Ya I really like that we finally got to see Lubba fight. I've always had an interest in his imperial arms. Can you only have 1 imperial arms or can you have multiple? 
 Yup, Lubbock really shined!! We have seen him in action, and it's been hinted that he has quite the useful power... He's certainly very resourceful with it. But we never knew just how powerful... And Akame is still a "very dangerous woman", lol... The four Koujenji Rakshasa demons were quite formidable looking, but they didn't last long against just two of the Night Raid members... I'm really interested in seeing the last demon though. She piqued my interest the most, but we never got to see her in action this episode. And this "follower" on Borick-sama... at first I thought she was the spy and I had to go back through the episode again to see that she wasn't (the spy girl has longer, lighter-colored hair). But we all know that Tatsumi and Mein are tied by the red string of fate... Though they do like to show off their lovers' quarrels... But in the end, Justice will purge the Evil! Right, Seryuu? 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 I love how those demons were like "Oh imperial Arms? We'll kill them no problem." Lubbock takes down 2! and Akame takes care of hers...easily mind you. These demons are chumps, bring on the Jaegers, I hope Tatsumi and Mine destroy Seryuu 

 Originally Posted by Sora Senpai I love how those demons were like "Oh imperial Arms? We'll kill them no problem." Lubbock takes down 2! and Akame takes care of hers...easily mind you. These demons are chumps Which just means Seryuu was right. Justice is always right. 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 I can't wAit for the jaegers to fight. I'm really interested in seeing wave and the arch angel use their imperial arms 
 Ep 19, justice has finally come. So happy for mine. So does anyone think mine x Tatsumi will happen? 
 SO STOKED for Esdeath vs Najenda! So happy REAL Justice is served. But seriously Wave and Kurome...precious...its a shame they need to die. Also Lubbock has been doing WORK LATELY!!! 

 Ugh, I'm conflicted. I have a feeling Esdeath will pull a 180 and join Tatsumi's side, but end up dying protecting him or something. (I haven't read the manga.) Another theory I have, is everyone but Tatsumi dies, and he leads the new world after the rebellion. Or it could go a completely un-predicted direction.. This anime has a tendency to do that which is amazing.

They are destined together. But damn, what a great fight! A fight for vengeance on both sides! I cried for Coro at the end of it! Seryuu was just misunderstood... I was happy to see the fight with Suzuka, the last Rakshasa demon... The rest of Night Raid were also awesome as always... And I always love seeing Kurome and Esdeath. 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 I expected a little more of the last demon Suzuka...but damn Mine vs. Seryuu was freaking epic...The way she broke her fall by shooting in the ground and reflected the shots fired by miss Justice had me like, she could actually do that? At first I didn't think much of her, but today she proved me wrong... Shame they did Coro like that...was one of the coolest imperial arms thus far...cute as hell and scary as f...if that does make any sense idk... Esdeath, Esdeath, Esdeath...what will you bring to the table next week, this show got me hyped, i'm gonna read the manga till I reach where I'm at with the anime. They should def make a game out of this show, like a 2D fighter or something, I think it has a lot of potential 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 I was really glad Seryuu got finished off. She was one of the most twisted characters. I lol'd when Mine pointed that out.

At first I didn't think much of her, but today she proved me wrong... Actually, I'm pretty sure we've seen her do that before. What I thought was really cool was how she was hiding the true ability of her Pumpkin. She always said it got more powerful when she was in a pinch, which is totally believable considering the truth. It actually runs off her emotions, and she experiences heightened emotions when in a pinch. I always wondered why she was so open about her weapon's ability, which should not be so easily revealed. That's because that wasn't the way it really works. Now that we know it runs off her emotions, her having somebody she wants to live for can make her much more powerful and consistent. Originally Posted by JoeyManga Shame they did Coro like that...was one of the coolest imperial arms thus far...cute as hell and scary as f...if that does make any sense idk... But Coro brought Seryuu back to her senses at the end. He did well, as a good dog always does. T_T I cried at that scene.

They should def make a game out of this show, like a 2D fighter or something, I think it has a lot of potential I would love to see that! I love 2D Fighting Games based off anime, manga, or visual novel characters... like Melty Blood, JoJo's All-Star Battle, etc... I'm big into Melty Blood. Love Tsukihime. I even have the Ougon Musou Kyoku fighting game with the Umineko no Naku Koro ni characters. 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 Yeam I mean it with the imperial arms and the diversity of the characters, it could make for a good fighting game...maybe they can do the imperial arms in a way they did with JoJo's game with the stands...but i'm dreaming a bit now, cause I would love to beat the **** out of Kurome with Akame Yeah I thought the whole pinch idea was a bit farfetched, I can handle the idea of it running on emotions a bit more I think. 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 I just started watching this anime its really good Have a couple of episodes to watched to catch up.
