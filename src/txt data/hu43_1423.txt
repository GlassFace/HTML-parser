 Quick Announcement
 Hey guys, In light of some PMs and messages that we're receiving: The admins have been working on the site, so please be patient and bear with it for now. I am sure they'll update us when things are sorted. Some of the forum addons have been disabled, such as the chatbox. Feel free to make use of our IRC chatroom instead in the meantime. Avatar uploader has been disabled, so don't change your ava for now. Smilies are not working. Mods have been given a brand new hamster wheel. They were just fixing up our cage. Please don't spam this thread. If you find anything else strange, post it here. Otherwise, this serves to inform people of what's going on. EDIT: Knuckles posted up a sticky (top of this subforum) explaining everything, so closing this to prevent bumping.

 Do you RP, or are you interested in learning? Join our Role Player's Society here on A4. Would you like a baseball bat to shove up your ass along with that stick? You're a mod, please act like one A4 is on FACEBOOK
