 Have you ever had the sad disorder?
 http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaso...ctive_disorder It gets really blah here in Michigan as far as winter weather goes. It can be cloudy and cold for days and days. Of course itll be cold in winter but not seeing sunshine for long stretches does start to grate you. I don't get really depressed but I do notice my enthusiasm and general energy does dip in the winter. Fortunately going to the gym this year should help that a little. So do you ever get down certain times of the year?
