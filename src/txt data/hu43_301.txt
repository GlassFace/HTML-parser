 That doesn't help answer Ixi's question.

 What's your tier Ixi's? good job! on the winning. If I had that I could get to Platinum in no time XD still got 2 more divisions to go in gold hrm... I wish they madew a different victorious skin; Elise is LAME! in my opinion.

 I've been playing LoL since 2009 when it was released. It was my WoW killer. I used to play ranked in SR, but the current meta game pushed me away. The game used to be less elitist back then and many item builds were viable unlike now, where most people build the same thing no matter what champion they are. My favorite champions are all the supports, with the exception of Lulu, who I find rather dull. Unfortunately, Riot is slowly fading out healers, which means I'm forced more and more to play differently in order to support effectively. Gone are the days of the Almighty Soraka and Taric heals. Sona remains, but hasn't much left to spare healing wise. These days her Q+Passive burst is what keeps her strongly in the "meta". Now it's more about CC AP more than actual supporting though. Luckily, Dominion is there to keep me happy though. I love the fast paced action and quick games. It's better than people think at first. I at first hated Dominion, but once you get out of the newbie bracket, it can get really competitive. You can still test builds and would be amazed at what a unique build can pull off. It's all about surprising the enemy! AD Annie? Sure thing! My last game our Annie snagged a Pentakill with her! *laughs*

Yeah EUW here and we never get anything other than IP boosts. Now don't get me wrong I don't want to beg for free stuff just because the server is down a few times but it's kind of unfair to hear other servers get free skins and stuff and we get ip boosts if we even get anything at all...

XD @ Tak You got my vote. I got a couple of people on my LoL friends list that watches streams so Ill see if I can get their votes for you.

 Takera we stand in awe. I never knew that tank lee could do so much damage. 

 Game started off as 0/4. Pretty much all dying at same time. I wasn't doing too bad... was 1/2 in a 1v2 lane against a 1/1 talon... UNTIL:  Spoiler Sad thing is... Their jungler NEVER went bot... our jungler was down there dying 3v2 to the draven bot fed... Elise camped ryze and lb... how the **** do u lose a 3v2 lane... I was able to nuke draven... if he didn't 2hit me before i finished my entire dfg combo.

Meanwhile in booze 5, someone thought amumu top was... Good? I mean what, I guess it can work, never seen it from higher elo players, I mean THIS is booze 5, but what was he thinking? That's basicly thinking like hotshotgg and going Karthus top.  Spoiler 
A calm . mind is the key to success.
 Booze 5? Why?
