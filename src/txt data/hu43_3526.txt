 Jailbreaking an IPhone 6 (maybe)
 So for Christmas my amazing parents were kind enough to give me an Iphone 6 and I absolutely love it too death. As much as I love Apple products I have never bothered to jailbreak a phone since I never saw any real reward for doing it. Since i started reading manga I got some free manga downloaded as a gift from a friend of mine. The first volume of One Piece looked fantastic in the IBooks app and I was really surprised at how smooth it was. When I wanted to read more manga I realized it costs 5$ a volume. Which is insane for a low budget highschooler. Were gonna ignore the fact that getting free things from the app store is illegal (tehe). Anyway it would be awesome to have some manga readily available to me. Anyway I want to know if you guys think jailbreaking a new phone is worth it to begin with. I have an old IPhone 4s that I might try it on but I have no experience with jailbreaking. Even though I've watched and read a few things on jailbreaking I want to know your guys' opinions on whether I should do it or not.
