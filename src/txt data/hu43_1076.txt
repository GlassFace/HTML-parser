 Forum Signatures (PLEASE READ)
 Please Read this thread: http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...=1#post2328575 It's become relevant again since there are a number of people who just simply did not read it and I'm hoping people will fix it before we need to go removing things. Now, while we do not mind what size files you post in the Visual Arts forum where it's all about artistic expression, we do expect you guys to follow the signature rules for the forum signature space as it can be quite annoying for people who are reading the forums to have to scroll through massive images that fill their entire screen. We do have a relaxed approach to it, so if it's within the dimensions allowed (300 x 550) and still under 200kb (we're not nazis), we generally turn a blind eye. Going over that is not acceptable since there are other anime forums with a 50kb limit on sigs. (yes, really ) If you've got 2 or 3 signatures in your space, or a ridiculously large image then we are probably going to remove it or PM you. There is no need for more than one main signature image at a time. Rotate them out if you have more sigs than 1, please. Thanks guys.
