 Japanese Names
 Alright... I've never been very good at finding or making up names for my Characters. Let alone, finding names from a different culture in an entirely different language. I need some Japanese names for some characters of mine. My Japanese name knowledge goes as far as a random name generator I found off the web. So that's where I need your help. Where/how can I find some Japanese names for my characters? Maybe a helpful guide or list on the internet that I'm overlooking. Anyways, thanks for the help! 4xdblack
