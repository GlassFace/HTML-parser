This, Pured, is why it's called booze 5, you might never understand because people carried you away from this inn, but yeah, it's a bad place, never go full booze 5, especially when you're bronze 1, you'll never get out, the body guards wont let you leave.

 My friend plays plat games drunk, booze 5 mskes no sense. Also how do you get carried out of a place you've never been? If everyone is drunk, does that include you? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Ykhdk2Qfw Wish I was madlife...

 1. Knowing you always brag about ****, I know this is bs because when you're drunk, you're 25-30% slower than someone who didn't drink, by the time he realises he's being attacked, he's already dead most of the time, that or he got boosted or again, bs. 2. You got the chances of being in booze 5 carried out. 3. Not it doesn't, I started bronze 1 and on and on, I guess it's what happens when you're toxic. Back on topic. My games lately have being going, rather great better and better everyday, I didn't get any warning saying I was being offensive or anything, I did get negative attitude for... Helping I guess? I don't know, don't care, my games have been going better now since I was less of a douchebag, someone might want to take note on this, hint hint.  Spoiler

 I have a friend that plays drunk and he managed to reach Gold 4 so far. He even is talking about making a livestream just to demonstrate his drunken skill to a wider audience. 
 If you can still play lol when drunk, you're not drinking enough.

I finally got some LoL time in yesterday and "tried," to get in some practice with top lane. I played about about 4 games yesterday, and the champs I used were, Kassadin, Shen, Leona, Hecraim. Did I get to play top? Hell....no. Why? cuz I all my games were full of INSTALOCKERS. Game 1: I join. call top, choose shen. 2 roles called later, Guy locks darius, and says "Top with my friend alex." -_- Everybody tells him I called top first, he claims he doesnt see it. I would have jungled, but we had nobody to support our adc, so I filled in the slot, and the duo top gets owned by their yi jungle. We lost. GG Game 2: I join up. Call top lane, guy joins room, instalocks Garen and doesnt say anything. Other people call their roles and the only thing we are missing is a mid. Ask the guys where hes going and he says....."Top." After the rest of us let him know I called top already his only answer is...."I locked in already." So I pick Kass and get fed. We win. GG Game 3: Join room, call top 3 times. Guy joins room, instalocks Pantheon. Tell him I called top already. he says "We can duo top." after our jungle has already been picked. -_- I end up picking Leona to support and we win. GG Game 4: Join room call top. 2 other people come in instalock Trynd, and Gangplank and call top after me. I end up going jungle and by some miracle we win with a trynd supporting our jinx. -_-. GG The idiots I get to play with.

Well, I forwarded him your post and his response was: [3:38:44 PM] Bones: I am so good, I dont even need eye hand coordination or focus to kick ass [3:39:00 PM] Bones: it is so natural, in my blood...I can own noobs in my sleep literally [3:40:07 PM] Bones: Hennessy is a magical alcohol, it improves my abilities not hurt them 
 Yeah, Dyrus is also really good at stomping noobs when sleepy. Dyrus: Man I'm sleepy and this guy is challenger. *makes him go 0/10*

 http://www.twitch.tv/ggaming2/b/471643800 Check out my tournament I'm on Nautilus, it's a all family teamD. Game one, we lost but it was such a close game we had no bases in our game, We got the Nexus to 8hp then we died, they went down middle and won >.> it was so ridiculous LOL but it wasn't a depressing moment it was a platinum team. and our first tournament so I wasn't disappointed we did very well. We managed to place so we go back Saturday and play the Diamond,Challenger teams O.O. Game two was just a blow out we went 29 and 5...

 I've come to the conclusion that I could have the mechanical skill of Faker and still be in Gold IV, because I have the shittiest luck on the planet. If God exists, he exists solely to f*ck with me on League of Legends.

 Morello is literally the worst. They should hire someone else to balance the ****ing game.
