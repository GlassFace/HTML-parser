 So what's sup, anyway I got some problems yes. Joe Pesci fathead problems that is. There are currently 8 different varieties of black mold on my Joe Pesci Fathead and it is causing me some turmoil. This fathead is vintage and of great value to me, but it has also put several Turkish lubricant merchants in the hospital pand caused the extinction of several endangered species of bird due to the fumes. It is clear that the poster is causing great hubbub but I cannot force myself to let it go. I mean, who is gonna call me a worthless ****ing Jagov in an Oscar worthy fashion and stab me in the face everyday before my grueling work at the hog factory? I need that kind of motivation but the lynch mob outside my door begs to differ. So what do you big beefy boise think I should do?
