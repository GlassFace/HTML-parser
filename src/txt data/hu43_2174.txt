[Event] A4's 7th Annual Awards
 Welcome to the Annual A4 Awards for 2013. 2 Days Left to get nominations in. Looking back over the entire year January - December 2013, you are asked to nominate members, threads and events under a list of categories. You may be tempted to only look at the past couple of months, but really think about the entire year. Maybe the person is not currently posting, but still made an impact over the year. If you've only joined in the last few weeks, it means you can't honestly participate without making stuff up, but look forward to next year. I will then set up polls that will run for a week or two, depending on participation. Get Nominating! For a list of categories and to post your nominations CLICK HERE!
