 Power Rangers Dino Charge!
 So, the latest installment of Power Rangers premi√®red online today. As a life-long Tokusatsu fan, I was cautiously optimistic. It did seem like they had a solid writing team behind the show, and all the early information seemed to point to a welcome change of pace to the faltering franchise. Honestly, this is the show that's going to save the Franchise. I know the last couple shows were financially successful, but the children watching were going to lose interest if they didn't up their game. I did, as a kid, until they started to put together more elaborate (at least for the age group. Nothing in Power Rangers is elaborate) storylines. A lot of subplots and backstory was set up in a way that moved at a brisk pace, and wasn't obviously set up for future moments. It also gets bonus points for having the first black Pink Ranger and Hispanic Red Ranger, and actually making them the focus of the show. The footage is mostly original footage shot for Power Rangers (perhaps they found the original Kyoryuger far too silly), but makes good use of the original suits. Otherwise the effects are just as bad as you would expect from Power Rangers, with terrible puppetry and CG. The Producers don't care because they want the show to remain cheap and profitable, and the writers and directors don't care because they are just going to do what they want, and not care how cheap it looks. Definitely check it out if your a Tokusatsu fan. This is a pretty strong adaptation.
