 League of Legends - Page 392
 Over 2000 Dominion (check out DominateDominion if you want to go against the pros) and 3000 Summoner's Rift (Gold seems to be the new "ELO hell") games here. Working on ARAM now. Can't stand Twisted Treeline though..that will be my next challenge. Must master all LoL maps so I can quit to ESO/EQN knowing I did it all!

Couldn't say it better myself. You stomped his ass into the cold frozen ground and rubbed it with your foot for a long while. 

 I'm curious about whether his chances of success would have been greater or smaller had you guys played a custom game on the howling abyss map. Assuming the champs would be the same, I wonder if a level 3 Lee with an item or two would have done better, or if he would have just been outplayed that much harder. A doran's shield along with those potions would have gone a long way all on its own.

 Pured just stop posting, you never contribute anything meaningful. Chii, don't feed obvious trolls like Pured. Take it to PM if you need to, but stop slapfighting in this thread. 

 Honestly, I don't know why I play ranked solo queue anymore. It's just the biggest cluster**** ever; either my team will ROLL FACE zOMG WUT or they will be the absolute worst kind of players and afk/intentionally feed. I don't understand why solo queue cannot have a different ranking system so that it puts players of skill with players of skill, and leave people who belong in silver and below where they are. I'm not saying that I deserve to be like, Platinum or Diamond - I'm not that good - but I know I could hold my own in Gold. I'm extremely frustrated with League at this point, and honestly I don't know why I keep playing when I know I can never carry myself out of "elo hell." 
 
 Lol, take a break from everyone who says they should be at a higher elo and listen to this... I know a kid who is in gold, he duoed with a platinum. Rages soooo hard. Wait for it... He honestly believes he is a challenger player. He 100% does (He is retarded) But still it is ****ing hilarious how serious he is.

A doran's shield along with those potions would have gone a long way all on its own. Honestly I think it would have been the same. Only for one reason. brushes in the howling abyss map are waay closer to the lane. which lets Caitlyn abuse her passive, zoning him even more. Sure Lee Sin's level 3 damage is true terror. but I think there is something I should point out. In that 1v1 I kind of took the damage he gave me since I didn't have my E. If we played on the howling abyss I think I would have pretty much E'd out every time he lands a Q negating most of his damage.

 Perhaps it would have been the same, but we'll never know for sure because you lacked the foresight to use the howling abyss as your battlefield!

 I think I might have done the impossible. Beat a full late game team with 4 squishies on my team. They had a nasus with 780 stacks on his Q Team score 50 - 34 The level of Teamplay we pulled off to beat that team was LCS level. this was just a solo Q game I dont even know these people. I have it all recorded though I'll share some later.

 Well just got done with 2 normals where trolls protesting lane calls made stuff get crazy. 1st one somehow 2 vote went against the surrender at 20 mins. Sad game. 2nd game well I'll let this do some talking  Spoiler Basically Yi fed (1 kill on a low hp kill steal on Talon or something like it) all game, but the Shaco who originally called jungle split push us to victory and I landed some nice spears (Taric needed to learn how to dodge). We won the after I selflessly sacrificed myself for Shaco to get a pentakill on Talon. I feel like a sweet little angel. 

 So my friend who works for Riot is in the process of setting of something like saltybets for league. http://www.twitch.tv/saltyteemo Right now the channels the only thing up; betting interface still in the process of being written, but yeah you can watch double digit elo ranked games, which are truly eyeopening.

Tell your friend thank you for me. 

 Oh man. Could be better than actual saltybet once the betting system is set up.

Will people be able to see their names? or just their champions? Because a lot of numbers in name = lose by default. It sounds like fun... but who gonna watch whole matches...

 Yes Pured, we'll be able to see your name when you inevitably show up on stream. 

 I thought the whole fun of saltybet is that its AI and not humans? Am I missing something or is Pured's stupidity confusing me? Btw they already have saltybetdota, gj on being late shitty riot games.

Btw they already have saltybetdota, gj on being late shitty riot games. Yeah some of the fun of saltybetting was the unpredictability brought about by AI, but in this case the same level of unpredictability is achieved due to the sheer amount of terribleness happening at such a low elo level. So it's still pretty entertaining! Also it's not like an official riot thing, just something this crazy guy is working on on the side for fun. 

 Welp, I thought we had this early on, I guess not because Bronze elo too strong, too deep.  Spoiler So, it all started pretty decent, except nocturne kept failing his gank and it was pink warded too, but Olaf got it back up and I was all like '' Yeah man, we got this, just go in and I ult you Olaf!'' And we kept doing so, but the thing is, he'd only ult when he was about to die, which is like, pointless. Then I was like, oh but Ezreal is fed, we g... WHY, BLUE, EZREAL, NO. Then Nocturne and Olaf kept trying to go 1v5, going deep as **** so I couldn't ult and shield them, and then I was thinking of going ad lulu at the end, I got to the shop, frame droped and by the time my computer decided to get it's frame back up because shop lagging op, all I heard was ''triple kill''. Ezreal decided to build A NORMAL BUILD, end game, which is a good reason why we lost, also, the amount of bad building in this game is just really bad, may the four lords save us all. :') 
A calm . mind is the key to success.
