 I haven't written any fanfics but i did have an idea for one based on digimon adventure 2 where myotismon returns and threatens to destroy both digital and real world. In the final battle omnimon dna digivolves with imperialdramon and kills myotismon. It would also feature myotismon kill kari and tk after they tried to protect their children which leads to tia and matt almost going insane untill davis and ken step in and remind them why they were fighting which eventualy leads to the previously mentioned dna digivolving of omnimon and imperiadramon and the emotional final battle with myotismon.

 I have written a Black Butler one on fanfiction.net. It's an Alois x Ciel fanfic and it's called "The Guarded Dog." I have also written a couple of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX fanfics involving Judai(Jaden) and Sho(Syrus), lol. 
 OMG! I read that! I loved that fanfic! You wrote it? That is so awesome!!!!

Not a bad idea, but in my mind, I would replace myotismon with Arkadimon, since Arkadimon is way more lethal (being one of a few super ultimate digimons, and also capable of reducing it's opponent into primitive data of 0s and 1s) and using mytismon again is kind of less fun As for myself, I have only written two fanfics, but only one worth mentioning. It's a Hyouka fanfic, and just in case I leave the link here.

 Well I loved "The Cat and the Bee" (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2904676...at-and-The-Bee) Its a yuri but its written well and I love the story and I wrote one myself, though I think it isn't that great or anything (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8785673...st-This-Moment)
