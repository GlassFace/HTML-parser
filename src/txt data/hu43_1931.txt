 Welcome to A4, yeah if you like one piece then you will most likely like Beelzebub but enjoy it here on the forums

 lol. Hi there, Con. I like your introduction title. Anyway, welcome to A4!!! 
 
 Woohoo.. warm welcomes @Dragnight44: Glad to be here. Yeah I'm liking Fairy Tail, watched 4 episodes, seems like it started pacing. Also started watching ' Trigun' and "History's Stongest Disciple Kenichi"; loving how realistic (fights wise) that Kenichi anime is. Even learned 2-3 tricks from it lol. That Hitman anime is also in my to be watched list. I still miss One Piece though; waiting for new manga and anime is painful; usually watch a whole season, without much breaks. Those characters are too solid, maybe it's cause they nurtured with love hehe. Only problem is there're a season worth of filler episodes. Only good thing is this is not going to end in this decade. There're so much to be done by Luffy and gang. And the anime movie "one piece x toriko x dragon ball z" didn't make much sense; but loved the new 'One Piece Z' flick ..Ta for the recommendations. @ Solo: Thanks friend. I'll deffo check out Beelzebub. Just looked it up, one of the characters looks like a miniature Zoro (marimo lol) @Pured: Thanks you. @Rissa: hehe... Thanks. Which samurai/swordsman anime you guys like the most? (except.. 'Rurouni Kenshin')
