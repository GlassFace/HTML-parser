[Action] Kill La Kill
 KlaK inflated things to a huge, almost satirical level of what pure action-thriller are. If you can't forgive how blatantly obvious the anime pokes fun at the ecchii, battle, rivalry, etc. themes present in action-thriller films than you probably won't enjoy it anyways. You sat through 20 something episodes and still decided to walk away? Even when the anime itself is only about 25? Um...what you're saying and what you intend on doing seem a bit contradicting to me.
