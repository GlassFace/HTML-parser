[General Discussion] Do you shop on black Friday? (US super sale day)
 So the day after Thanksgiving (US holiday) is a big big sales day for stores in the US. Do you go shopping on that day? I have in the past. I've gotten a new computer on a big sale one year and I got the first Wii the week after it launched. I haven't gone since. The traffic is horrible and people are insane. Oh wait I did try for some discounted movies last year. And I got my first no name tablet a couple years ago at a Kmart sale on thanksgiving. But generally I haven't done the big Friday push in a long time. I like my sanity more than a sale - unless its a two hundred dollar 40" 3d TV. I might go out for that.... So do you got on the black Friday crush????
