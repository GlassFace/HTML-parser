[Fantasy] Akatsuki no Yona (Yona of the Dawn)
 Akatsuki no Yona (暁のヨナ) is a Japanese manga series by Mizuho Kusanagi, serialized in Hakusensha's shōjo manga magazine Hana to Yume from August 2009. It has been collected in fourteen tankōbon volumes as of July 2014. An anime television series adaptation by Pierrot has been announced. The story revolves around Yona, the sole princess of Kingdom of Kouka. Like princesses in general, she lives a happy life in the castle filled with luxury with her father, King Il; her servant, Son Hak; and her cousin and love interest, Soo-won. However, everything changed on the night of her sixteenth birthday. Intending to tell her father that she cannot forget her love for Soo-won, she visits his room, only to witness her father killed by Soo-won, who reveals that he will become the king. With Hak's help, they escaped from the castle to Hak's birthplace, Village of Wind. Under Hak's grandfather's suggestion, Yona and Hak meets the monk, Ik-soo who tells them about the legend of the first king of Kouka, Hiryuu and the four dragons. Yona and Hak decide to travel around the country to find the four legendary dragons to survive.

 An interesting potential one! Looking forward to watching ep1 before commenting further though (:

 This might be one of the shows I drop episode one. It's interesting, kind of, but the animation is lackluster and the art style is poor at best. It spent 50% of the episode of main girl just being a ****ing retard. We'll see, I guess. 

 Episode 2 was great. I am looking forward to when the party forms! 

 So I just got hold of the first four eps, hope that it's as good as it sounds like 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 Looks like the whole series gonna be a flashbackfest. There're even flashback combos, u know when she flashback the time she flashed-back

 This show is good, its just dragggggging. It better be 24 episode because we need to see the party formed, and then the party doing work and killing people too. 

 Wait WTH, how did I miss this, the premise alone is epic, and to compound matters, It's being made by Studio Pierrot of all people. Yea I'm gonna have to watch this Edit: Omg yea this is awesome, There's a lot of fools in this anime though. Soo-won is a moron however you look at it  Spoiler He claims he's bent on revenge, yet acts like he's clearly lusting over the thrown. There were many other ways to to kill the king, without it being connected to him. One may argue he was so swallowed up be revenge, that he wanted to personally kill the king in the manner he claims the king killed his father, except there was no emotion whatso ever one way another, he wasn't enraged, nor was he happy after taking revenge, even though he claims to have wanted to do such for ages now. Then there's the fact he knew the princess was in love with him, and the first thought that goes through his head, is now I need to kill the Princess... WTF is wrong with this guy lol. The Princess only ran after he tried to kill her after all. Then he gives up the hunt to call a meeting of the tribes, I mean did he really think he would be blindly accepted as the new king, just because he should've been the king in the first place, yet his younger brother was made the crowned prince instead. However even without the Princess by his side, he could've gained the power of the king, without the actual title of king, by declaring that the king was about to announce the Princess, and his engagement, but Hak snapped, killed the King, and ran off with the Princess. Then while all that is in place, and Hak is labeled a traitor, as regent he could send his personal guard, passed off as his army to search for them, then woops while they were trying to take out hak, the Princess got killed, woops what a shame, but these things happen. At that time, he could declare himself king, and no one would be alive or have reason to object. Anyway yea, for someone who claims to have been planning this for awhile now, there doesn't seem to be much thought in his actions at all Yona for a 16 year old princess, Isn't well versed in public affairs/handling people. What the hell are her tutors teaching her in the palace, at her age she should be already engaged for crying out loud, yet she doesn't even seem to know how to insult someone, without it openly sounding like a insult. She should not only be a master of that art by now, she should be able to read people like a book(well atleast among the nobility anyway). Needless to say, someone in the palace hasn't been doing their job very well. She comes off being even more sheltered then most Princesses, how considering such, she's handling things pretty well. After all that's happened, you would expect someone like her to be pretty much unable to function at all, so I definitely give her props for that(she not playing a woes with me pity party, she's not catatonic or crying a unreasonable amount, she's not acting like a stupid spoiled brat making dumb demands, ect, so yea she's handling things considerably well). The King has brought this on himself though, due to him acting  Spoiler It's so just a act, he's no coward like a coward(even in the presence of his own personal palace guards), even though he's not. The last people you should want to lose face around, is anyone in the palace(rather it be just some servant, a dime a dozen palace guards or a general, and you definitely don't want to look weak in front of family members) Hak's grandfather, he's no one's fool lol = enough said Hak  Spoiler I knew he was secretly inlove with the Princess since ep 1, he's not the kind of person who would serve someone out of some silly notion of nobility or loyalty to the crown. Also he clearly has no desire for the throne whatso ever, which is no doubt the main reason he doesn't want to be open with his feelings to the Princess, and instead hides behind the fact he Isn't a noble by birth, even though absolutely no one thinks of him less, infact he was made the Wind Clan's Chief, as well as one of the heist ranked generals. Traditionally such would make him a prime candidate for marrying the Princess, on top of such, there's a pretty high chance that, that was the kings plan in the first place. The king encouraged them to be friends as children, that at like age 13, offers him the position of being her personal bodyguard. The only way it could be more obvious, is if the king made a royal decree, demanding them to be wed lol, but while I doubt Hak Isn't aware of such, he doesn't want nothing to do with politics in general He's no fool either, he just doesn't want anything to do with the high ranking nobility type of life at all. I personally feel the only thing he finds more bothersome then being a lap dog for the crown, is to be the king its self He's easily my favorite character so far(come to think of it, he reminds me of Zoltor, their situations differs "alittle", but the way they think, and their personalities are pretty much exactly the same)  Spoiler even his act/plan in ep 4 in taking the initiative in declaring him self a traitor(you know, since soo-won was too much a moron to do that as of yet lol) to use it as a distraction to secretly hide the Princess away in clear site, the last place they would look for her, is so something Zoltor would do, if he was in such a situation. There really is no other option, since Hak's father was openly against soo won appointing himself as king, and the fire tribe backing the Usurper. It's a insanely huge sacrifice, I highly doubt many people realize how huge a sacrifice his plan entails. However if the OP is any indication, doesn't look like things are gonna go as planned, he's gonna have to take the Princess with him, which I think is all the better anyway, as far as the quality of the story goes anyway . Sigh now I have to wait a whole week, just to see 1 more episode, what BS. I knew this was gonna be a epic anime from just the premise, and then the fact sudio Pierrot is making it, makes this a sure bet. I knew better then to start watching this, but sigh I had nothing else to watch atm, and combine that with the insanely high chance of this being a epic anime, I just couldn't bare to wait. Edit 2: I just finished ep 5, and that wasn't how I pictured the not going as planned, plan from ep 4 was gonna come about  Spoiler I'm really starting to love Yona now, I wouldn't have ever guessed that she had it in her to be that noble/respectful in such a situation or so conscious enough of the reality of the situation to be so caring about how others are being effected, and after such traumatizing events at that. Even more amazing, is what she did later on in the ep+how she put the future chief/general of the Fire Tribe in his place after that, just wow Um, wtf where did Studio Pierrot learn how to execute cliffhangers like this, lol someone has been researching wuxia series, haven't they(It's the only thing they could've picked up this unique skill from). This is only gonna make the series greater, but at the same time It's gonna make the blasted wait every week all the more painful sigh.

 [IMG][/IMG] It probally wouldn't be a good idea to get on Qiang Lei's bad side.
 Just caught up and finished ep 6...the Wind Tribe is my kinda tribe, bunch a strong people loving good food, playing jokes and napping all day lol. Hak is a total bad ass, dude knows how to fight. Though the 'sexy time' talk with Yona was pretty funny, it came outa nowhere and served no further purpose. I love how they try to switch the mood from time to time with a bit of chibi scenes, I actually lolled some times...Now I just hope they got some crazy epic stuff in store for us with the four dragons and the other tribes...the Earth tribes chief looks like he knows his way around the battlefield...A battle between him and Hak tops my list... 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!

I clicked on the link to this forum to see if people liked this anime and saw this post by zoltor. So I started it and watched the first 12 eps I one sitting. This anime is awesome. Does anyone know how many episodes it's going to be? I couldn't find out anywhere. 
 This anime seems interesting, I might give it a try, thanks for this anime review.

Yea(lol yea, this anime just begs to be marathoned, but It's so awesome, I couldn't bare to wait until the season ends, to start watching it) this is a awesome anime, bordering on greatness, easily my favorite anime since 2012's Kingdom.

 Yes this is one of the better anime's of this season. Plenty of action and comedy, a good mix. Blue Dragon is my favorite Dragon. Hak though...omg dude has me rolling every episode. 

 this show deserves more views indeed...it's amazing...Blue Dragon's story though, brings sadness on a whole new level...last episode I lol'd a few times...specially with the scene they where exploring the dungeon and they gone all retro on us Hak I love you bro lol

Poor Hak though. Hak needs to be more blunt with Yona(poor Hak Isn't getting anywhere, she must be the most naïve/sheltered princess ever). I don't know, something along the like of holding her to the ground, while having a really big smile on his face, and then kissing her or we can go traditional(don't give yona a chance to ruin it), wakeup Yona in the morning with a kiss. How can anymone be as dens as Yona, I mean come on, does she really think Hak took the job to be her bodyguard, because he had nothing better to do or just because the king asked him to lol, please, Hak is too noble to willingly become anyone's lap dog. How after all these years, she still doesn't realize Hak loves her? The funniest thing yet, was Hak stuffing Yona in a bag, and doing whatever with her lol. I bet you a million bucks that has been Hak's fantay for the longest time, although I doubt he ever thought he would have the chance to live out his fantasy(lets face it, if the king didn't have him beheaded, his adopted father would've made Hak with the King did, so yea, in a million years, Hak probally never dreamed of having such a opportunity). Hak is so awesome

 Ya Hak is the man, I really hope he does get yona. It would be terrible if he confessed his love to her and she turned him down because she still couldn't get over her feelings for her douche cousin.

Yea As for that, I'm hoping Hak is the one who sends that prick straight to hell, in a million pieces.

 Ep 14 was pretty damn funny. This series has great characters. They are all badass but funny in their own way. I can't wait to see what the other dragons are like 
 Originally Posted by Zoltor It's gonna be atleast 24 ep, not sure if It's gonna get/need a second season though. I'm a few weeks behind on the show, but I feel that if any show should get a season 2 it should be Yona. The manga itself is still ongoing and the anime is really just scratching the surface of the story right now. 
 Yeah I wonder if we'll ever get to the arc where she starts retaking the kingdom.

 I doubt it will be this season. I feel like she will get all the dragons and it will end right before the arc where they try to retake the kingdom. With that being said, I don't read the manga so take my opinion with a grain of salt 
 That'll need many cours ahead. I don't read too ✌

 That new opening is AWESOME!!!
