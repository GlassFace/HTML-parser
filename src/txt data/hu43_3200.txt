 Ferguson, MO; Declined indictment of Darren Wilson
 I personally find it shameful. If the looters actually genuinely cared about Brown, why loot and pillage and burn your own city? If they really cared, why loot stores of as many shoes as you can hold and then burn down the building? To me, the looters are just taking advantage of a volatile situation. Strike when the iron is hot, if you will. They are getting what they can out of this and feigning to care about Michael Brown. As I heard someone say, what legacy does this leave of Michael Brown's life? No one will remember who he was, but only that he died and the trial that ensued caused the city to erupt into riots that burned the city. That is his legacy now. He died in violence and violence spewed forth in the wake of it all. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
