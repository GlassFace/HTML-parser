[Comedy] Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun - Page 3
 Just decided to catch up to this, hadn't been watching it. Wow. I missed out. XD 
 Those WW2 Black and White montages had me rolling. Also Seo Senpai...<3 Love her! 

 Yeeeah, get pumped up with those loud horns and brass section in the OP! It's like Ska music! Hold on, was that scene making fun of that Sylvester Stallone film Cliffhanger?! Oh god the sequence if events following Nozaki's first surprise...and his emotionless face, xD that was funny. "Excitement is hard." Nozaki 2014 Alright folks, let's get that Hentai doujin up right now for this series, we've got the perfect title. Woah, Sakura's face(s) when she beheld the inside of her gift bento...was adorbs. She is so cute, I swear. Ah the puddin' cup! It was a BUNNY. TOO KAWAII. Oh...low blow Nozaki...low blow. Dude the derp faces Wakamatsu makes are so hilarious because of how brief they appear. Ahhh it's the Guys Night, and Nozaki's whipping out the Playstation! For once can these people act normally or comfortable?! Guys...Heavy Rain...the Playstation is right there...Quantic Dreams is awaiting. HAHa Nozaki's imagination is too good, I love his on the spot thinking and creative adaptations. Oh, those ****ers teased us with the romantic pairings...that writer is such a bastard. Arm-wrestling is normal though...goodnight guys, love you all! Woah...that preview ended with a very gripping teaser. I'm sure things will not go our way though, this is a comedy anime ofc and...I WANT THE LOVE TO BE REAL DAMNIT. Make it happen, please! 
 Poor Sakura. I hope she at least gets some hope in the last episode. 
 Seo Senpai and Wakamatsu though...she was pulling that tie...Seo Senpai!!! <3 

 Chiyo, your answer has to blow all those other girls out of the water. Say it with me, "Nozaki's sperm". What is this collective of Girls who organize the obligatory chocolates being gifted during Valentines Day in Highschool?! Damn, I just realized Seo must be super hawt if she doesn't cover those slender legs of hers with knee-high or thigh-high socks or stockings. Kashima...get ****ing serious, enough with the derp faces...sit down...do you love Hori-senpai? lol the two princes are so powerful! lol Miko and his transparent as hell method of getting compliments! What a good dog. All these moments...but nothing truly fruitful in the ways of solid romantic progression...just tiny jokes here and there, Grr. Sakura is mega adorable. Her moments with Nozaki seem to actually have substance. Those credits...beautiful music and pretty damn funny scenes mixed in. OH that misunderstanding, It actually made me laugh out loud, but I am still a bit irritated! Ahhh...Chiyo, we're not happy with it though. Loved this anime with all my heart and soul, it was amazing. 
 I'm sad this show have come to an end and that low blow at the end was so painful to watch. As far as I'm concerned there is no second season confirmed so I might just get on with the manga instead. Though when all is said, it was a great show!

 Hilarious as ever, I don't know what was I expecting from Nozaki. Tho, that mute gave me a second thought about nozaki. In the end, everyone loves fireworks. haha No show will make me laugh as hard as this show on a monday morning, since this is the last ep. ;_;

 I jus marathoned ten through twelve. This was such a cute show. The reactions are priceless. It reminds me of the kawaii complex in that sense. The ending was suitable for the show. I just kind of wish nozaki had more reactions in the normal world. Meaning not just the cut away still reactions. He's too deadpanned sometimes. But then again that is part of the charm of the show. I wonder what rom-com I'll latch onto during the fall run.

 I liked the show, however, I also disliked it. I just didn't like how they couldn't take anything serious and everything was all ''fun''. I mean, I like it, and I understand why people like it, but I also understand why people would dislike it. I gotta give it credit because it was so much fun tho', I loved all the faces lol.

Well it was intended to be a romantic COMEDY so yeah. But I'm glad you were able to enjoy it.

 Is that a fan made trailer? It was all clips. I'd be all for an ova or movie though.

 Saw this amv and thought I would get into the anime...first episode is kind of dull, I mean it's funny but it feels dull.
