 Fantasy Books
 @AKAnime: Yeah so from what I gather from ASOIF is that the first three books are excellent as a trilogy, then it gets dragged out. From your list, I've read the Farseer Trilogy. I am currently reading The Stormlight Archive, which was a suggestion from BuddyLee. I really enjoyed Mistborn, so was drawn to it then. Just got my hands on Words of Radiance today, but halfway through part 2 of The Way of Kings. I was making poor progress with reading since Christmas because work was a bit mental. I do have a reading list though. Books that I own but have not yet read, or only read a few chapters of. lol. I got sidetracked by suggestions. XD. - All three current books of the Gentleman Bastard series by Scott Lynch - Steelheart by Brandon Sanderson - The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss - First Book of The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. (I actually have the last 3 in hardback because I got them on sale for 2 euro each (warehouse damaged, very slightly with black marks on the edges), so I will read the series eventually.) - The Long Earth and The Long War by Terry Pratchett & Stephen Baxter - Thief's Magic - Trudi Cadavan And a couple other ones. These will keep me going for several months
