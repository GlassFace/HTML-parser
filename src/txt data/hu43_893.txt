[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Omg... are you frikin serious.. This is crazy. Am I the only one that laughed when  Spoiler L-elf pulled out his gun about to shoot Shoko, if she made the wrong call? Like Damn lolo Andd Ok So Haruto feels like he can't be with Shoko anyway because he's not human anymore, and he feels like he's not good enough for her. So did he  Spoiler ask Rion to marry him, because he didn't want her to be "alone" anymore? And he feels like he HAS to because he raped her? Like I have no clue.  Spoiler AND did L-elf anticipate the soldiers making their way inside? Seeing as he didn't write this down, maybe he didn't. But maybe he did, and he wanted to just take things into his own hands. I just don't know what to think.
