 Is Obama On Tv To Much
 No, not particularly. While he doesn't need to be on all the time, it's good to know what a countries' leader is doing for the country, it should help voters make a more informed decision* * But in the US it doesn't work like that sadly. Even though I supported Obama, to find only 56% or so of people voted for him sorta worries me hugely. 
Thanks for the avatar Amoo :3
