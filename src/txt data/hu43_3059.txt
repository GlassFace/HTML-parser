 Your opinion about diseases
 Okay i really need to let this out. Before people start on this this is what i think and what i want to say. Im sorry if that offends someone. But each time i hear someone say: "I want there to be a cure for cancer or aids" Im like, No. I dont want that, that would be stupid. I mean its not that i want those people to die but people have to die. If we cure all diseases new ones will just come to exist and they will kill others as much as cancer and aids are
