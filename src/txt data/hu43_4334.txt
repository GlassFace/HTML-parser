 Japan outraged at ISIS Beheading of Hostage.
 No, that doesn't make you butthurt. But high levels of sarcasm and insults does. Please be respectful and a little intelligent. I mean this IS a thread about people dying at the hands of terrorists. Do you honestly think the best thing to do is to flame a random American who has absolutely no control over what his government does? I don't.
