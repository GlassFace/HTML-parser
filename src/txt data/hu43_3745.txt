 Requesting a Romance Anime
 @scaryhobo - thought of two more for you: Oreimo (my little sister can't be this cute) And My wife is a highschool girl Oreimo is a fun suedo echhi rom-com. The fun thing is the main characters form an anime club. My wife is a highschool girl isn't a hentai title (neither is oreimo). Actually nothing racy happens in this one. It might sound kinky and creepy but it really isn't. Its more about keeping the relationship secret.
