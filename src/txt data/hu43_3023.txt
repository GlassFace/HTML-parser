 Feminist games critic cancels talk after terror threat
 Video game journalism has never had the purpose of disseminating ideas in the way you're suggesting though. Sure there are probably some fringe publications and sites that might actually attempt to produce content with integrity, but the vast majority are there to provide 9s and 10s to AAA titles from billion dollar corporations to try and persuade consumers to buy those products. They aren't journalists, they're advertisers at that point. I am not suggesting that gamergate is undone because of this though or they're incapable of having a positive impact in other ways, there's just no way I'm going to accept the argument that they've uncovered this previously "unknown" fact about video game journalists, or that it's a useful avenue for affecting change in the industry as a whole when those sites and publications are already on a downward trend thanks to the proliferation of livestreaming and pre-release builds, like alphas and betas becoming so predominant.
