[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Glad to see that there will be a second season coming this October! I wish Rukino would have actually said yes to Haruto, it would have definitely made things more interesting but now it looks like were back at square one. I can't help but notice the beginning with Rukino talking to someone that I'd assume is her child? He had grey hair so that kinda threw me off, what if she actually ends up with L-Elf? Unless that was Haruto's kid, anyways I can't wait for season 2 so many questions to be answered.
