[Mecha] Gundam Build Fighters Try
 The sequel to Gundam Build Fighters, an anime which folded the right amounts of slice-of-life, light drama, touches of romance, friendly comedy, and great mecha action with a decent storyline and entertaining anime in itself. Gundam Build Fighters Try is set seven years after Gundam Build Fighters. Hoshino Fumina is a school-girl who adores Gunpla battling, but the club that Sei and Reiji used to run seven years ago is in danger of being closed down. Here comes the transfer student, a fiery scarlet-haired boy named Kamiki Sekai, who learns the wonders of Gunpla Battling. Fumina's friend, Kousaka Yuuma, is a very talented Gunpla builder and battler, and decides to join her and Sekai in their aspriation to reach the All-Japan Gunpla Battle Championship. My reaction to the first episode: Ohhh that opening was awesome. Was that Sei?! Hawt female character with a drive and motive, and a cool fighter kid who's searching for a special person. Interesting! LOL the Police arrived so quickly. Oh, so that guy who looks a bit like Sei is named Yuuma? YES. Admire that perfect model. xD She had to bind him. That's the trophy of LEGENDS you're touching there BOY. Awww that's romantic. Woah it's the old man. YEAh, take that you mushroom headed ****face. HOLY **** that was an amazing pilot episode, a fantastic set-up to the sequel to Build fighters. I am most definitely hooked.
