 Fantasy Books
 Recently I've gotten into fantasy and fiction. Just finished Conan the Cimmarian by Robert E. Howard. It was really cool stuff. I love how he describes fight scenes. I felt like a kid again. To think this was written more than 80 years ago. I want to check out his Solomon Cane stories, but those are more horror. I saw a documentary on H.P. Lovecraft, but never read his stuff. I don't think it would be my cup of tea.
