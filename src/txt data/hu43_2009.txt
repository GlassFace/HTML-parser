 The Kagerou Project (カゲロウプロジェクト Kagerō Purojekuto, lit. "Heat Haze Project"), also known as Kagerou Daze, is a Vocaloid song series created by Jin (also known as Shizen no Teki-P). The story revolves around the Mekakushi Dan, a group of teenagers with unusual eye-related powers. The series became popular on the video sharing website Niconico after the release of the song "Kagerou Daze" (カゲロウデイズ?, lit. "Heat Haze Daze"), which also gave the series its name. The song has amassed over 3 million views and is the most popular song of the project. Four light novels have been released, written by Jin and illustrated by Shidu. A fifth novel has been announced. A manga adaptation with illustrations by Satō Mahirō, began serialization in Monthly Comic Gene on June 15, 2012. An anime adaptation titled Mekaku City Actors will be directed by Akiyuki Shinbo and produced by Shaft will begin production in Japan in April 2014. We've got a few banners up that I made from this series! that will be airing in April~! I personally am a pretty huge fan of Kagerou Project, its has an interesting concept the story gets told in two ways, in songs and in the manga. I can't wait to see how they adapt that into the anime. The songs are really catchy with characters telling a story. A lot of time has been spent in making the lyrics and MV by Jin. PLOT Shintarō Kisaragi is an 18-year old hiki-NEET who has not left his room in two years, engrossing himself with his computer and the internet. However, on August 15, due to the messing about of the cyber girl Ene, who lives inside his computer, Shintarō spills soda on his computer keyboard and is forced to go outside to buy a new one, due to the fact that during the Obon festival none of the stores will deliver until August 17. Shintarō goes to the department store, where a group of criminals break in and hold the people inside hostage for ransom. Here he comes in contact with a group of teenagers calling themselves the "Mekakushi Dan" (メカクシ団?, lit. "Blindfold Gang"), who stop the robbery with their mysterious eye powers and force Shintarō into joining their group.

 You beat me to this lol. But whatevs. Just as much as I'm excited, I'm also unsure about this path. KagePro has been said to have one of the worst fandom in Japan, and that's without any anime airing. I wonder how the anime will impact this. I just hope there won't be any fags popping out and starts ruining the fandom here. But I'll try to be positive and hope for the best.

 Somebody's getting worked up. Have no idea about the works of Shaft studio( even after having checked their library). As for Akiyuki Shinbo, he was a unit director and part of the storyboard in Yu Yu Hakusho. If they can make this anime a success then hats off.

 Since I started reading the manga a few weeks ago, I've really liked it so far. The story is interesting and it gets better with every chapter. The fact that it's going to be a vocaloid song series is even better, I really liked the songs! As a new fan, I'm looking forward to see the anime adaptation! .^^. Though I didn't know four novels have been released based on it! :O Originally Posted by DynaBlade KagePro has been said to have one of the worst fandom in Japan, and that's without any anime airing. I really hope the production doesn't stop halfway because of that. ><" Maybe once anime is aired, it gets better responses...At least I hope so. >_<

Now it's up to mod whether they would merge these threads together, or take one down.

Even if worst come to worst, it would only got delayed, but cancelling the production altogether is highly unlikely. I hope so, but it all come down to the people in it, including us.

 6 More days left until it airs

 Interesting first episode, looks different from what I imagined but at least the personality of the characters are close to what I expected. Waiting for Konoha to appear and preparing for the feels.

 Weird adaption so far, episode 1. I like it a lot though! they haven't really captured Shintarou's crying personage and the guy keeping everyone hostage didn't get that many lines. bueh. the voice actors are really good! Art was weird at first but got better later on.

 I was previously a part of the anime industry. I'll be sure to trick all the noobs here with that line. Didn't know what to expect from the series but what I saw really entertained me. Shintarou visits the outside world after two years to buy a keyboard and becomes a hostage. Totally deserved it. Also I kinda noticed that the dialogues are spoken a bit hurriedly in certain parts.

 Second episode is pretty interesting so far so good, and still waiting for Konoha to appear.Also looking forward to see what happens to the monster they keep talking about at the end. Even though I have a hunch about who that is.

 As it is made by Shaft and the overall style of the show reminds me of Monogatari it literally felt like I was watching an episode from that series which is great I have high hopes for this show =]

I haven't watched Monogatari, so I dont know. It's great having to see new animation styles, to me at least. Ene ftw.

If you like the style of this maybe you should give Bakemonogatari a try, it is the exact same style, washed out characters, mainly its only the main characters in locations and the 'citizens' in the world aren't drawn to give your attention to the characters. It is a very interesting idea of style and animation and I would recommend it to you defo

 Caught up on episode 2. Seems like we're gonna have a couple more of character intro eps.

 So now we know some of their powers, and the next episode is probably going to be sad because if they are adapting the Anime as it is according to the music videos then the next episode should be predictable.

 Wow...the title of Episode 4...I watched this Video 2 years ago...crazy its coming back to me. Btw this is a great song, and I like this version more then the MIku version. 

 My favorite character finally appeared(Konoha) but the feels in episode 4, how must Hibiya have felt to have to experience the same thing happen to his loved over and over again, though the sad part is that he is unable to save his loved one the events in this episode were to be expected though based on the preview from the previous episode 
  Spoiler 
 The best anime this season so far. 
 This series is the 10/10 would bang daughter of Durarara and Bakemonogatari. With that I hope you understand I'm saying that so far the series is bloody perfect.

 As others have said before, the animator's have done a great job of revealing how close the anime's quality is to that of the Monogatari series...which has yet to be completely resolved! I love the colorful characters, although one or two are not so vibrant as of the moment, but I'm sure they'll be fleshed out later on. The latest ep was wicked, I LOVED that ending. Really great initial story so far, I'm very excited to see the future fragments. 
 I dont know enough about the Kagerou project in all honesty, so it was kinda crazy how it jumped right into the world where she constantly is dieing. But I guess that dude with the White hair is the cat in the other world.
