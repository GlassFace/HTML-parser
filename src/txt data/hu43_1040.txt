[General Discussion] Your opinion on A4? - Page 3
 Tova-reactions and Mo'ronic posts in same thread? And there was me thinking I wasn't gonna fap today. Anyway, I typed in 'anime firums' and then clicked on 'did you mean Anime Forums' and the rest, as they say, is history. I joined a bunch of anime, movie, horror, and bigbooty sites but this is the only one I still post on. The others I wasn't really ever active or have closed down. Or in the case of Fark, Reddit, imdb just gone to complete sh1t. Originally Posted by Pured p.s. who is Aioidaisei? He was less annoying than you but a pedo. So worse than you. Just.

This post is just dripping with blood from that sore butt of yours. It must be absolutely shredded. Take it easy man, you're going to have permanent damage. lol @ "nobody likes you anyway T^T" mmm pure gold It's truly unfortunate, because all I wanted when I agreed to become a moderator on an anime forum with emotionally unstable members was to be loved.

Tova would need to be awfully stupid to fall for any bait that someone as bad at trolling as myself could possibly lay. I don't think he's stupid. If you're truly concerned with the direction the forum has taken, or the quality of its content, by all means become an active member and work to improve it! Or just stick to the IRC and make the odd complaint post on the forum whenever the IRC decides to rally against whatever the A4 topic of the day is. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 Will forum mods never stop whining about the IRC being some sort of counter culture hotbed of dissent, rebellion and iniquity? I mean I'd understand if any of you who continually b*tch and moan about that ever hung around and had witnessed something resembling your complaints, but goodness it's just not true. 

 Nobody really listens to complaints of other members. I think it's because the 2-3 people who naturally act like they can never be satisfied on this forum are usually ignored by the populace for A damn good reason! It's usually quite obvious.

 It is nice to see this thread made it 1.5 pages before degrading into off topic chatting and people b*tching at each other. If people want a nice environment, then go out of your way to make it nice. Crying solves nothing. If someone has an issue, report it and provide evidence as to why it is an issue. If people don't want to be civil --> take it elsewhere 
 Thank you for answering a question no one asked, Arc. And I'm starting to get an idea why some users may be irc'ed at the direction the forum is taking. If people want a nice environment, then go out of your way to make it nice. Crying solves nothing. If someone has an issue, report it and provide evidence as to why it is an issue. Kawaii can't we all get along?

 Maybe just actually post about anime instead of hanging out exclusively in terrible subforums. God knows how longs it's been since I've seen a green name that wasn't Lu post in an anime thread. Which is a shame given how many good shows are out this season!

I don't get directly involved in these things. Tax purposes.

Or in the case of Fark, Reddit, imdb just gone to complete sh1t. He was less annoying than you but a pedo. So worse than you. Just. That gif is exactly how I feel right now. Off that note, my opinion of A4 is pretty indifferent. I do not gain anything by coming here anymore, really, except perhaps the memories and the occasional amusing thread such as this. Some of the mods annoy me to tears, not to mention the fact that any past members I might have known and commiserated with have gone or I just keep in touch with them outside of here. I also find that members whose panties got stuck in a permanent wad are the ones who seem to stick around, and the complaining about some trivial matter here and there is just...excess. That and my interest in anime is just almost non-existent. Couple that with the fact that I feel like I 0% of what I say is interesting. In any case, my reply has now become superfluous. Good luck A4, I will probably continue lurking once every blue moon.

 This thread's progression is indicative of something, I just can't figure out what yet. First page is nothing but newbies talking about how kind and nice everyone here is and how there aren't any trolls and how everyone is welcome in the community and it's all gumdrops and rainbows, and then suddenly it spirals into this ugly, ugly other side that occasionally creeps out from the shadows. It's kinda like discovering that perfect family in the neighborhood that everyone envies isn't that perfect after all, and mom's got a drinking problem and dad doesn't love her anymore and the oldest daughter just got knocked up and the other kids fight like animals and are constantly at each other's throats and the whole thing is just one really bad argument away from totally imploding. So let's just sweep that side back under the rug again for now.

So let's just sweep that side back under the rug again for now. That is exactly what I was thinking (In one form or another). Starts off as a legit thread, but most threads after a page or 2 turn into arguements and who hates who more.

Perfect family that everyone envies? Haha. I'd say the more realistic analogy would be that family everyone avoids because the mom is a gossip, the dad is a close talker with halitosis, the son has sex with chickens, and the daughter likes to lick mailboxes. Nobody envies them, but nobody pays them much mind nor bears them any malice... until the children in the neighborhood start missing.

No one listens to one another anyway. I'M TRYING. But now that we're playing League I just want to do that QQ

You haven't contributed to the forum since your fictional halcyon days that you post about. 

 You need A hug Ian.. P.S. : I love this ****ing thread.

I know a lot of people have been jealous for years of my rugged good looks, razor sharp wit, and incomparably enticing charm, but this is totally not the place to air those envy-soaked grievances. I have an inbox and VMs you can all feel free to spam. Also, next person to call my news site (One that I spent months building a damn good news aggregator for from the ground up, at that) a god damn forum I am just going to ban forever.

 Also, I think he meant 'f*ck off back to your news forum.' Still incorrect and out of line.

Ian you know that I am well hung around the chat. Oh yea, I didn't even realize we still had admins around. Well that's nice, maybe now that we have an active one that's actively replying to suggestion threads that something just might finally happen? But maybe not. I will never understand why we still have suggestion forums when nothing ever happens around here.
