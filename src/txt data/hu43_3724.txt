[Video] Touhou And Science
 Yep, you read the title correctly... The corresponding paper, is linked below. Touhou - A Scientific Interpretation: http://www.scribd.com/doc/234365775/...etation#scribd Head to the video's source for list of the credits, with links to the original video sources. Wasn't sure where to place this thread to be honest, hopefully it's in the right spot (techincally, Touhou isn't an anime). Enjoy. 
 Gonna take me a while and considering I don't study physics I doubt I'll understand the mathematics of your work, I'll get to reading your piece because I'm to a fan of Touhou and in a book I'm working on I use a lot of personalities that come from Touhou such as Yuyuko, Flandre, and Chino. It's a mix of spiritual and science like the Many Worlds Theory and the M theory and even a few ideas from Interstellar which is a fantastic movie. So that being said I'll get back to you on what I think of your work once I finish reading it.

 More my type of video 
 Credit to Token for the signature! poke him if you want one 8D Check out the Osu! and the Wallpaper Thread
 The hell is a toe ho' and how is discussing foot fetishism suitable for a family friendly forum? *reported* 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Stop advertising your fake science project to get views. Applying science to 2hu, what are you even doing?

How is it fake, he's put a lot of work into that piece he wrote and it's all theoretical. Do you understand how theoretical is different than fake? Fake is something proven wrong while theoretical is something possible yet not dis-proven. Theoretical only becomes fake once it is proven.

 Sarcasm over the internet is pointless, you can't judge the person over a few sort words so it's better to take the comment seriously. I'll begin with the point I am trying to make which is that it's not a silly idea to try to explain things scientifically, even in a game full of magic, it would be one thing if the creator never dove into the scientific realm but ZUN clearly has. Yes Touhou is magic but we have Utsuho Reiuji, one of many Touhou character and who has a scientific power, Nuclear Fusion. And many others which are explained in EtriusSierra's original post. The comparison is equivalent to some famous movies such as Star Wars and other science fiction works came out. All theory in those are more or less proven now and the Force in Star Wars is speculated to be Dark Matter. George Lucas probably thought the little idea of the Force was cool to add in but due to looking into it more we came to the above conclusion that it could be Dark Matter in our universe. So this is my point reaffirmed. By not looking at all possibilities, you never see everything so looking at Touhou in scientific views isn't silly but a way of ruling out possible over impossible. And if possible we can look into creating such devices.

 Alright time to check back to the... woah. MoSteel: Well said. In a way, nothing is really ever 100% proven in science, only supported by a strong consensus to preserve falsifiability. ZeroG: Did you read the end of the video? This has been interesting to read through.

Applying science to 2hu, what are you even doing? You know I watched the video, read through a majority of the piece, and I really don't think it's worth shitting on. I mean, it is what it is: a fun exercise. Having been through Uni as an engineer, having friends that are Physicists, we did all kinds of dumb stuff like this with our free time, it's just a way to blow off steam and have fun. Some people slam Pogs, some play video games, others dick around in the fields of Math and Science to “explain” fictional things. Just look at the “Kessel Run” theories that all sprang out from some dumb techno-babble they chucked into the StarWars script, or movies like Sunshine, it’s grown into entertainment beyond the original intention. Yeah the Touhou “theory” relies on a lot of pretty wild assumptions, but you should really view it more like comedy than some genuine attempt to prove 2hu is “for realz.” The mere fact you understand that the assumptions are so wild should add to how funny/interesting it is. Given its non-serious comedic nature I don’t see a reason to get pissy about this. I mean yeah just skim through it: 0.2 Tesla magnetic field (Several orders of magnitude greater than than our own at the earth's surface, also an implicit assumption the field is uniform even though they were implied to have originated from previous mentions of black holes and other dimensions), modeling the skeletal structure as cylinders embedded with Iron fibers (yet ignoring the mass of the added iron), 47KW that would most assuredly cook most living organisms, extra organs for ATP synthesis etc. The humor lies in the fact that these things are outrageous given the models that are used. If it was presented as the end all be all, "This is 4 realz what Zun-sama intended, 2hu is actually plausible!" it would rustle my jimjams, but knowing otherwise I really don’t see a reason to be bothered by it. And you damn well know know it's been done by a physics student when you see comments like "Note: This amount of power is distributed throughout Reimu, per fiber less than a 1W LED" which I heartily laughed at because he clearly doesn't have any reference for how ridiculous that is. It's indicative of "physics as math" rather than "physics as a phenomena" mentality. It’s just another way of engaging and enjoying something. I highly recommend checking out "XKCD" and "What if?" which are more examples of fun (also better/more robust) exercises in science/math. If the piece was intended to legitimately explain how 2hu is real, I'd be quite fine going from zero to ham real quick. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them.

Given its non-serious comedic nature I don’t see a reason to get pissy about this. Well, to be perfectly honest, I didn't start this project for the sake of comical gain, neither did I start it to try to say that Touhou was real. I started and continued with this, to see if I could push the limits of known science towards the realm of Touhou, while still preserving some degree of plausibility, to even produce some ideas applicable to real life. The strengthened magnetic field for instance, led me to considering how life could potentially develop on other planets, within such a magnetic enviroment where a planet's core could have a much higher metal content (hence, stronger magnetic field). Evolution might find ways of utilising this, hence the whole idea behind the iron fibers for flight, which still preserves having things like hands with poseable thumbs (very important for making/using prehistoric tools). In terms of the power usage and hence the heat generated, I didn't think that was too much of a problem for several reasons. - Bone is a decent insulator. - Flight at high altitudes at a fast speed through the air, would act to more efficiently radiate the heat generated away from Reimu. - The iron fibers are not active constantly (active mostly in short bursts), and are likely only active at a power usage somewhat less then what was calculated over durations of about 20-30min (I probably could've mentioned this sooner, though I already had enough assumptions/complexity going for me). The calculated power usage takes into account the power required for to accelerate off the ground, not for maintaining flight at a fixed altitude. - As I said, the iron fibers are evenly distributed to spread the total amount of heat generated. I'm not sure I understand why having one iron fiber of a pre-defined volume producing less the then 1W like an LED, is laughable. Last I checked, there are LED's that can produce about 1W. Could you please explain? In any case, I appreciate your interest and thoughts, especially as an engineer. EDIT: I checked the figures regarding added mass by the iron fibers. At one stage I did these calculations before, but I don't know how the bloody hell I missed this (I suspect some units may have been miscarried somewhere or that I outright forgot to fully consider that variable). Yeah, I'm somewhat annoyed at myself for this, for I value the time and effort I spend in telling people my ideas, without misleading them with miscalculations (that's what a disclaimer is for fortunately). Currently in the process of working around this, to include the weight and to still maintain flight. The extra weight calculation works out to about 15kg (this is taking into account the mass lost from extruding out the volume of bone required to have the iron fibers). EDIT 2: Fixed. I'll make a point of posting future updates only in the youtube comments section from here on out (avoid spam). :P
