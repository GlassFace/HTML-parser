 Where would you rather live?

But really I do like my home state so there. Trust me, I have lived in Honolulu for six years. It's a nice place, but you only get a fraction of the commercial product that the mainland has to offer. You can get bored pretty fast. Unless of course you love going to the beach a lot. (or are willing to spend on plane tickets) For my answer, Japan seems to be a popular choice, and with what I know about it, I have to agree. Otherwise, I wouldn't mind living somewhere in Europe. Perhaps France. Wherever I decide, I probably should learn the language.
