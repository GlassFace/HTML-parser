 How do you stay motivated?? - Page 4
 Ok, so i love to work out. But I'm using the word "Love" very loosely. I never regret a workout, but i do regret when I'm to lazy to get up and get it done So what I'm asking is what is your motivation to keep going? I follow this blog on tumblr that's dedicated to exercise, and people show their before and after pictures, so that reallly motivates me. Also, because my family are exercise junkies, I get influence from them as well. Not mention, my mom watches Discovery health, and those shows called " The 600 pound man/or woman,"etc Push me too. But my problem is, I will work out religiously and on time for like a few weeks, and then just stop.. I know, I know " Only YOU can push yourself." But i'm also curious as to what other people may think about/watch/do/read/look/listen to, to stay motivated to excercise.
