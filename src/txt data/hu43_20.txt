 Brutal Legend
 Okay, so KT Samurai told me to download the demo last night. I did. I was immediately greeted with a familiar and very welcomed sight... DOUBLE FINE PRODUCTIONS. I had absolutely no idea that the game was made by the same production studio as the incredible Psychonauts. Holy God. The first thing I have to say about this game is the animation and art-style are great. The fight-mechanics feel a little... cheap? But you can easily get over that. I can't wait to get into this game. The humor is sure to be side-splitting as well.
