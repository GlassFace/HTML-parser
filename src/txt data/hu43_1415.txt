[Sports] No NHL Threads?!
 You are so lucky, I have always wanted to play hockey. My parents won't let me do it though because they don't want me "getting hurt", but they don't worry about that with anything else I play. What's your favorite NHL team? Mine is the Nashville Predators, and I'm so proud of them! They are having an outstanding season this year with many new players, and a new coach. We went from a nearly bottom feeding team, to fighting for first place in the entire league.
