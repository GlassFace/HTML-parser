 Not very good at introductions
 Hello all. I have been on quite a few different forums in my day. I am a bit of forum junkie you could say. As for an anime, I have many favorites. I like some of the classics, like DBZ. I also like the newer ones. Anyway, I'm not sure what else to say, other than it will be nice getting to know you guys. 
 Welcome to A4! I also like DBZ and judging by your avatar you also like Naruto. One of my favorite anime's is Katekyo Hitman Reborn! If you haven't seen it I suggest you check it out. I hope you enjoy the Forums.

 Welcome to A4. I think this a pretty good forum to be active in. Hope you enjoy your stay. Have fun.
