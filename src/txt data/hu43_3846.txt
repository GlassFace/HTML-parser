[General Discussion] Thoughts on Marriage ?
 I don't care for marriage If you want to go get married, then by all means, go do so. With a divorce rate that's not very laughable to look at, anything appealing or special it's supposed to show me has gone out the window. It's just glorified boyfriend/girlfriend to me. A lot of people do it for the thought of marriage, or they're just not ready yet. They think they have the one. The sheer number of people who get divorced makes it seem less like a "sacred" thing and more like the simple pen and paper thing. I know it's not, but that's what it kind of looks like. If I meet "the one", then it'll almost certainly change, but for me right now, I don't like the idea of having to look at one woman for the rest of my life.
