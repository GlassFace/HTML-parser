 The late 15 (song with no melody)
 so many papers I have burnt trying to chronicle my hurt I am soon to give up its surely true the same way I am giving up on you longing for you has made my heart so sick my desire realized has done me no good. the warnings were received and respectively ignored and only now can i perceive the beauty that had been set before I really should take a step back and wait for tomorrow to recount my heartache maybe then ill know if giving up on you is really the right thing to do longing for you has made my heart so sick my desire realized has done me no good. -http://kly-gallagher.weebly.com
