 Hello and welcome to A4. Don't worry I won't destroy you. 
 Â Spoiler 
 Welcome to A4.. You'll have to excuse me.. I'm having a little double vision at the moment.. but rest assured, you'll find a number of annoying humans on this site. I'd point them out, but then that would take all of the fun away from you, right? Ha. Try to enjoy your stay.. and I think I'll grab a few aspirins. If you've got any questions, shoot.

 Welcome to A4. Hope you enjoy your stay here 
 
 
 Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide. *Bill The Butcher - Gangs Of New York* 
 Welcome to A4. p.s. You couldn't destroy me even if you tried :3

 Welcome to A4. There is plenty of hollow humanity here. I hope you all do destroy each other. Enjoy Hell.
