 World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor
 Just hit 100 last night and was able to run a few level 100 dungeons. When you walk into those things with quest gear you have to really respect the mechanics, it was very refreshing. It's going to take me a long time to get geared enough for heroics since Dragon Age just dropped last night and it's going to ruin my life for a couple weeks (so good!) but I'll be at least dropping by to do my daily routine stuff like herbing, mining, scanning the AH and such. Most of the server queue times seem to be addressed for the places I frequent. Are things smoothing out for you guys, too?
