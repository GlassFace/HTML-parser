 Dr Slump Arale-chan design
 I'm sure a good number of you are familiar with Akira Toriyama and the work he has done with Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, but what about Dr Slump? Well this design I made is a bit of an homage to the Toriyama and how fun it can be to go back to the old school. https://www.teepublic.com/t-shirt/134293-crate-diggin
