[Mecha] Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor - Exodus
 Sequel to Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor, set two years after Heaven and Earth. Tatsumiyajima is the central island in the middle of a small cluster of islands, in a sleepy backwater of the Japanese isles. Not much happens there, and the island's young people go to school knowing that their lives are likely to remain peaceful and undisturbed. Or so they have been taught... but the truth is different. The fate of mankind is on the line, and Tatsumiyajima is the last line of defense against a hostile and incomprehensible enemy. At the center of it all, fighting for Humanity's continued existence, is the giant robot Fafner, the dragon that guards this final treasure of mankind. Fafner in the Azure (蒼穹のファフナー Sukuu no Fafner) is an anime series produced by Xebec. The story focuses on a group of children who pilot the titular Fafners in an escalating war against giant aliens called Festum. The anime is subtitled Dead Aggressor. A television special subtitled RIGHT OF LEFT aired on December 29, 2005, and a feature film subtitled HEAVEN AND EARTH had a theatrical release in Japan on December 25, 2010. The character designs were created by Hisashi Hirai, who is also known for his work on Infinite Ryvius, s-CRY-ed, Gundam SEED, and Gundam SEED Destiny. Tow Ubukata, creator of works like Le Chevalier D'Eon and Mardock Scramble, provided scripting for the latter half of the series. The mecha designer was Naohiro Washio.
