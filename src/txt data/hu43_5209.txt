 Signature & Avatar Workshop v.3 (READ FIRST POST - Requests Only)
 ​♥Hi. I would like to ask you to make a Signiture for me please♥ Here the picture I'd like you to use. I don't want anything fancy, I'd just like the words 'I can't protect you without holding a sword,' across the top in dark blue (it's okay if it covers the top of her head), and the words 'I can't embrace you while holding a sword.' in purple across the bottom, or you could put the words in the empty space on the left, if they will still be legiable. If you can make it bigger and it still has at least pretty good quality that woud be really cool. Thank you so much♥♥♥ If you except this, please send me a PM or post in my visitor messages, thank you♥
