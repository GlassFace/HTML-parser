 @Ronin Maybe this year we will actually get to see an Atlanta/Boston World Series. We have basically identical records at the moment, pretty cool huh. I thought the Braves would do well this year, but thought they would have to fight it out with the Nats, certainly didn't think we were gonna run away with the division this much. I really can't believe how good Boston has been though, definitely didn't see that coming. I'm enjoying the Braves' 13 game streak at the moment, it would be cool if we could push to 15 for a new franchise record but still a long way away. The way we are hitting and pitching now though, who knows. We are facing the Marlins next though and the Marlins have always been a thorn in our side. EDIT: Well, streak ended on a 1-0 loss due to a wild pitch but oh well, we won the next game. EDIT: 9/01/13 Where is everyone? And by everyone I mean all 3 or 4 people who have ever posted in this thread...
