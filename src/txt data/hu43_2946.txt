[Drama] Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April)
 They haven't revealed it yet. I've actually read ahead in the manga. Not sure if it's a spoiler but to stay safe I'll put in tags. They choose to perform... Â Spoiler A waltz from the ballet "Sleeping Beauty." Another Rachmaninoff transcription/arramgnement actually (like the Kreisler before). It's one piano for 4 hands. I bet the author played piano growing up and really liked Rachmaninoff.
