[Action] Durarara!!×2
 Gotta figure its  Spoiler blonde bike chick breaking into Anri's house. I mean they mentioned another job of torturing a girl while trying to kidnap the girl that's at Shinra's currently. Damn man these killers need to do some research though. You're going to try to decapitate Celty...clever, now you're going after Anri who has Saika and pretty much has a mind of its own haha. There's a storm brewing with the Dollars, but we knew about that, I am curious who  Spoiler the burglar was on the top floor of the 60th building, I doubt they'll go back to it but hell who knows. It sucks this season is in three parts, they better not leave this on a cliff hanger.
