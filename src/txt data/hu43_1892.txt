[General Discussion] Who here is scared of 'Don't hug me I'm scared'?
 Some weird ****ing youtube video that my beloved psychopath of a friend says is alright, personally terrifies me. Your thoughts? Video:  Spoiler 
 I can only imagine what the person who made it must be like. I can honestly say it creeps me out more than Lavender Town in Pokemon. 
 Absolutely splendid. Not scary, albeit weird and obviously has unsettling images. Now I know what great writers watch before writing. :P I loved it, thanks for sharing. And btw the song of it went hard. 
 Wow, that was really strange... It seemed like an odd childrens song until they 'got creative' and then it turned dark.

 I've seen it on one of the FineBros videos once. It made me go "...Wut?" but nothing more. I guess the message is just that things can go wrong when you get -too- creative? :P 
 
 ^ Like the person above, saw it with the reactions from Teens on TheFineBros. That sh it, got dark - real quick. But hey, I laughed when the single letter 'D' came out. Immaturity slowly leaking out from the seams. 
 
 Talk about being innocently murderous. Made me remember the film Orphan. It was funny though. Had a great laugh. Oh Snap, Pured and me all together in the same video. 
 That is one of my favorite videos on youtube. It's really entertaining and creative. Some people find it disturbing, but I think it's just unique and surprising. I also agree with this part of the lyrics :  Spoiler "Green is not a creative color." lol

 I feel like this was mean to be more humorous than scary. Its purpose seem to make you go, "WTF? LOL OMG! XD XD XD" At least I laughed at the end.
