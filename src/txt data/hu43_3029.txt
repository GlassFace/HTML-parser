 Feminist games critic cancels talk after terror threat
 Any proof I can show you will be waved away because GG is leaderless, it is without substantive coordination outside of those that have been revealed (and which they will deny). There is no one to be held accountable for anything GG does. That's the entire point of GG having no traceable authority, it can deny anything and claim credit for anything. Why is the media tapping Sarkeesian and Wu to speak about GG and no one for GG itself? There is no one to tap for GG, and anyone they do approach can be renounced by the movement if they say say the wrong thing or make the wrong argument. Any such person would be abandoned immediately and the claim would be that they do not speak on behalf of GG. You guys can point to the voices speaking out against GG because they are putting their names forward and are accepting the backlash that will inevitably come of it. Most coordination for GG happens where we can't see it, and the fronts for the movement like 8chan and KotakuInAction act as an impenetrable wall of nonsense while they struggle with in-fighting and damage control. They rile each other up and blame the "SJWs", like when /b/ hits /gg/ with child porn (something /b/ has been doing for years).
