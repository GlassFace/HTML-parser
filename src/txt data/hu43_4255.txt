 Where would you rather live?
 So many of you want to live in Japan. Do you realize how different it is there in real life compared to anime? It's two taottally opposite things. As for myself, I'd like to live in the remote villages of Norway and watch the world spin away. 
 It was only a matter of time... Now I am one with the night and stars again... Thank you, Rhyme's Law, for your signature art work.
