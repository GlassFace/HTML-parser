Yeah, a master's is needed nowadays. What grade level are you hoping to work with? What field are you working towards your Bachelor in? Maybe it's Education, I'm not sure. Here most 4 year undergrads are not BEds and you do the BEd afterwards for 1-2 years. Get involved with local schools and working with students. I was going to become a regular school teacher until I realized it would take me almost eight years to get the basic requirements. Don't worry, it'll fly by pretty fast though.
