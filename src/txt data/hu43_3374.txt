[Event] The 8th Annual A4 Awards  Nominations Thread
 Welcome to the 8th Annual A4 Awards. (2014) Looking back over the entire year January - December 2014, you are asked to nominate members, threads and events under the following categories. You may be tempted to only look at the past couple of months, but really think about the entire year. Maybe the person is not currently posting, but still made an impact over the year. If you've only joined in the last few weeks, it means you can't honestly participate without making stuff up, but look forward to next year. I will then set up polls that will run for a week or two, depending on participation. All nominations will not be included. Once nominations are in, we, the mods, will be whittling them down to the top few, depending on number of nominations for various threads, and those will be put forward into the public polls. This is not a popularity contest, (there are plenty of those throughout the year) but simply a way for the community to say "Thank You" to those who have made the forum a better place, so think about who has honestly been contributing in the various areas. ... well maybe not the spammer award lol. Please only nominate ONE person per category please. Thank you. Get Nominating! You may not nominate yourself. The categories are: (Just copy/paste them into your post. One post per person if possible please. You may come back and edit them before the closing date which is January (9th) Member Awards 1. A4’s Moderator of the Year 2.
