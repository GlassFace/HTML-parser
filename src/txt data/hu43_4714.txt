 RP-School Life
 *It was late...and as Akane slowly walks back to her dorm in school she notices a closed box by the street. At first she wanted to ignore it but curiosity got the better of her as she quickly opens it to reveal a pure white cat curled up in a ball. Happines filled her eyes as she picks up the box rushing to the store and buying some food and a litter box. Then she realized there might be a small problem...you. As she reaches the dorm room she realized that you hate cats so she gently picks up the cat sliding it down her shirt as she opens the door. You were still sitting on the couch playing your video game.Seeing this as a way to run for it she quickly streaks into her room closing the door as she lies down on the bed pulling the cat out softly petting it*
