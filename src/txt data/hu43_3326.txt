Great idea, lets lower ourselves to the same "eye for an eye" barbarianism that's plagued the human race for the past half-millennia. Why don't we cut off the hands of thieves and gouge the eyes of voyeurs also. Prisons are overly populated because we fill them with nonviolent criminals. The US has the highest incarceration rate in the world. We lock away people for minor crimes for years which costs us more than $80 billion in taxes to keep them there instead of using fines or probation to keep them contributing to society and the economy. The crime rate in the US has decreased by 25% since 1980 but our prison populations have quadrupled in the same amount of time. More than half of the entire US prison population has been incarcerated for nonviolent crimes. That is insane. If we moved to a system where we only imprisoned violent criminals we would save billions of dollars. Anytime I hear someone say we should just execute them I ask that person if they would be willing to tie the noose, pull the trigger, flip the switch, or plunge the needle. Its easy to say "kill the ****er" but would you actually murder another human being? So, would you?
