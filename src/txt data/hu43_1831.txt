[Anime] are you proud tht you watch anime or are u ashamed?
 Personally I dnt reli tell pple I watch anime......I find it awkward to talk abt anime 24/7 to ppl hu are nt interested in d least.I dnt reli hide the fact (I mention it every once in a while) bt I dnt publicize it either . But my family members dont reli knw , and I wud never tell them . WAT ABOUT U ? do u hide the fact tht u watch anime or do u take pride in it ? 
 I was telling my aunt when we were talking about directv just yesterday that the only reason I don't like it is cause they don't have on demand and I used to pay for the anime network to watch whenever I want. So I don't hide it, though I don't wear anime like a badge of honor either 
 Not shameful or prideful. It's just something I enjoy watching. 
 Well I love telling people I watch anime, It's just something people might have in common with me. I also feel very proud,happy and excited every time I watch anime, Because I enjoy everything about it. some anime can really relate to you, some are pretty much my life lol... 

 I doubt anyone is proud of watching anime... It's just a hobby.

 I'm not shameful of it at all. Most of my friends know I watch it and make fun of me for it a little, but tis a major part of who I am so I'm not going to be ashamed of that

 It's weird to be proud of anything you watch.

 I just watch anime for the fun of it and you should too. Anime is more mature than most "cartoons" and if somebody's telling you your'e still being a kid just ignore. 
 Originally Posted by Regnent Not shameful or prideful. It's just something I enjoy watching. This. Are you proud or ashamed of reading books? Of watching TV? It's the exact same thing, and my answer is exactly the same. 
 I love anime, my parrents know it, my friends know it and if i could the whole world would know it but seriously who would be ashamed to watch anime? The only people i can think of are the ones who belong to the "cartoons are for kids" clique.

 I don't hide the fact that I like anime. It is far more entertaining than American television anyway.

 Originally Posted by kukii011 WAT ABOUT U ? do u hide the fact tht u watch anime or do u take pride in it ? Neither. Like what most people have already said here, it's just a hobby. I don't take any pride in liking anime nor do I feel ashamed because of it. 

 I tell some people but not everybody. I don't think to myself "I wish I didn't like anime" either, if that's what you mean by ashamed of watching anime.

 I'm not ashamed of watching anime but there isn't really anything to be proud of either. It's like watching Spongebob. Nobody cares if you watch Spongebob. My parents and friends all know that I watch anime and they've all accepted it as a hobby (Or haven't spoken up about it). Besides, I've liked anime since I was very small so there isn't anything to be ashamed of. I've practically grown up with it. That doesn't mean I've spent my entire life staring at a screen watching it. >_> I have a very friend who talks about comic books and videogames all the time, we've often recommended things to each other and congratulated one another for being honest about our hobbies. It's just a hobby. 
 My Anime List
 I'm becoming more proud (well proud isn't the right word, how about not ashamed?) these days now that I can talk about it more openly (before no one around me ever knew what "anime" even was). People understand what it is nowadays a lot more than they did in the early 2000s. I find myself correcting less people who call it "cartoons" these days also. ^^V 
 I love it. Allthough I'm ashamed to say I like idol animes hehe 

 I don't hide it but I don't flaunt it either. I might make a notice of it when a website asks for my likes, but it will be right there between video games and reading books, I'm not going to make a special mention about it. If someone is against watching anime and calls me a child and/or verbally assaults me because I watch it I just kindly point out to them that they may suck a mans genitals and that I do not give a single gummy bear about what they think. 
 Depends on the age and circumstance. Like when I was 12 I had a semi small shrine of anime stuff in my closet. I was a proud anime fan and it showed. I wasn't ashamed to watch it. But that shitty tribute wasn't too much to be proud of. As an adult... why should I feel ashamed? Some people watch **** tv and they're proud of it.

You're so calm about it! I can't really agree with you though, walking away or replying with something like "K" would be something better to do in this situation~

I can't really agree with you though, walking away or replying with something like "K" would be something better to do in this situation~ well i think your getting worked up about this ...im calm because i accept my reality , in my community people my age are supposed to have outgrown animation .i dont really mind nt sharing my interests with people because they are my interests.......i just wanted to see if there were more people out there who were like me or whether most people have their freedom of choice ! 
 Well I used to hide the fact that I watched anime from people at first. Not even my family members knew, but in time I started being more open with it. My family eventually found out, along with my friends. So I don't try to hide it anymore, but on the other hand I wouldn't say i'm proud that I watch it. I'm not shouting it from roof tops or anythingXD
