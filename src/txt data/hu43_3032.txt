 Feminist games critic cancels talk after terror threat
 Yeah, I heard about that too. When I saw Wu being interviewed on HuffPo I immediately thought that she was mentally ill. The way that she constantly exaggerates every claim that she makes, speaks in a panicky way, contradicts herself repeatedly, and lies compulsively is just a huge red flag. Gamergate is the last thing she needs to involve herself in; she should probably get professional help because there's nothing normal about having such an intense victim complex and delusions of persecution. It's kind of hilarious that anti-Gamergaters decide to associate with her...
