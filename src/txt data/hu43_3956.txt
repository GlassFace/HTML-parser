 Which movie comic book villians are your favorites?
 Since this is a movie/tv show topic are we talking about our favorite performances of comic book villains? Anyway... Magneto (Michael Fassbender/Sir Ian Mckellen) Both men make Erik's actions understandable even if you don't care for his way Joker (Heath Ledger)- no explanation needed, just listen to that laugh
