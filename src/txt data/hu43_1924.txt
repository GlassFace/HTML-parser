[Video] The video that made you rofl the most
 It is quite obvious that you have numerous selections but post only one video. ONLY ONE. Also to prevent this thread from becoming a 'drop your videos' thread and get it locked, DO COMMENT.Now obviously you don't have to explain why the video is funny.So here are the options(quite meager indeed): 1. Did you enjoy the video by yourself or were you watching with someone else? 2. Did something funny happen in the aftermath(you fell from your chair while laughing, etc.) ********************* NO OBSCENITY AND NO POSTING OF IDENTICAL VIDEOS. Hope we make a nice library. Here's my funny one for the time being:  Spoiler Wait a minute. This might be obscene(verbally). If the mods feel it's obscene this video will probably be removed. Please view and reconsider before removal. For footballing reasons this is my favorite.Probably many won't be able to relate to it(Oh Snap would though).I did momentarily fall off my chair.

 I'm sure everyone saw this already by now, but when I first did elsewhere on the net. it was just too funny that I coulden't stop laughing about it. Mostly everyone who followed that thread it was posted on thought the same back then, So it's the one that I recall the most.  Spoiler

 OMG this video literally almost made me pee my pants. I was watching this with my older brother when we were really bored. The result of watching the video was to die for. I fell of my chair and laughed soooo hard that I couldn't breathe for a couple of seconds. So here it is:
