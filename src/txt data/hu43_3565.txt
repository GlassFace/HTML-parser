 Vegeta vs Hulk! - Page 2
 World War Hulk's footsteps alone were clearly demonstrated as being more powerful than Vegeta ever has, including SSJ4. It's no contest. Hulk is unarguably broken. Like Superman, but more entertaining.

 Damnit I wanna read World War and Planet Hulk now. Also Vegeta would look ridiculous in ripped jeans. Hulk wins. Shut it weeaboos. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 You people, I swear. Vegeta would blast that overgrown cow into the far reaches of the universe. 
 It was only a matter of time... Now I am one with the night and stars again... Thank you, Rhyme's Law, for your signature art work.

Honestly, Vegeta stands no chance against the Hulk, any trueblue nerd should know this by now.

 Hulk is like marvels doomsday. You can't kill him cause the more you hit him the madder he gets and the madder he gets the stronger he gets. Vegeta can go ss10 and hulk would still win

Which is why it is important to name versions. I have not seen any impressive feats from Avenger's (2012) Hulk suggesting planet busting capabilities. Comic hulk is pretty inconsistent.. He seems to be a borderline planet buster at best in his World War/World Breaker version, but his Professor Hulk version is not as powerful, though maybe smarter. His Savage Hulk version is strong but also stupid to say bluntly. Sure he has "infinite potential," but that does not really mean anything until he is shown to stomp Galactus or something. Just destroy him before he gets angry enough. Originally Posted by Struggler Vegeta has never destroyed any planets. Boasting and threatening to do not equate to actually doing it. Terror on Arlia, the eleventh episode of the Vegeta Saga proves he can do it, and that is early on in the series! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnqtg0bte6w Besides, during the Buu saga, Dabura (or was it Babidi?) confirmed that it takes 300 kili to destroy a planet. Super Saiyan Goku has over 3000, so it is safe to assume Vegeta has around that too because he is at least SSJ2, which is at least twice as powerful as the SSJ1 form.

 My mistake, I thought we were discussing things that weren't fabricated by third party animators. Counting things like SSJ4 is done for the novelty of it, because DB is just so pathetic compared to the Marvel or DC universes. This doesn't open the door to every non-canon silliness that exists. Things that didn't really happen aren't generally brought up in debates like these.

 Well, you still have the kili example from the Buu saga, which is canon as far as I am aware. Vegeta has never destroyed a planet, but evidence suggests that he has more than enough power to do it if he wanted to.

 Hulk can only get so strong, vegeta can keep getting stronger. You tell me. 

 The question is who would win between hulk and vegeta. Basically a single battle. So Vegetas "Unlimited Power" wouldn't count here. If it was more than 1 battle then yeah probably vegeta, but a single battle at their current strongest? Maestro/World War Hulk vs. SS4 Vegeta. Hulk would own him hands down. Vegeta for some reason or another pretty much just loses if hes hit once from anybody other than Goku. Every villain that seemed to get a nice hit pretty much owned vegeta. Vegetas battle usually follow the same setup. Fight stars - Vegeta Gets Hit - Spazzes on Energy Shots - Vegeta Loses. ^_^ Win for the Hulk.

It is like how Piccolo always follow the pattern, saves Gohan, beat a few bad guys, immediately takes a major hit, and is out the rest of the saga. The writing is just making room for Goku to save the day again. Besides, are not DBZ characters always taking hits that demolish mountains and hills?

 Wait wait wait. Vegeta can punch the planet and itll explode. The hulk isnt that strong.

His galick gun from the first arc was supposedly powerful enough to destroy a planet, yet when he blows himself up when he's at his absolutely most powerful, he just leaves a crater. Evidence suggests Vegeta can't destroy planets. This is always what the argument boils down to in DB vs ___ talks. People saying so and so can destroy planets, despite no evidence to actually support such a claim. Originally Posted by Sam_Winchester Hulk can only get so strong, vegeta can keep getting stronger. You tell me. You have that backwards. The Hulk's strength is directly proportional to how angry he is. There is literally no limit to his strength. Vegeta's topped out in the Buu saga, and required an artificial boost by way of magic provided by Babidi to get any stronger.

Evidence suggests Vegeta can't destroy planets. This is always what the argument boils down to in DB vs ___ talks. People saying so and so can destroy planets, despite no evidence to actually support such a claim. Vegeta was pretty tapped out from his fight with Buu before he self-destructed, so your claim of him being at his most powerful is false...unless he got Senzu'd and I just missed it. DBZ and comics are not known for their power consistency. It is possible to theorize that DBZ characters can control their energy to destroy just what they want to destroy. Of course, there is not much evidence to support that, but it is also true that the characters make craters in their fights all the time without going all out self destruct. They are always concerned about the planet getting blown up whenever someone aim their attacks toward the planet. Heck, if Master Roshi can destroy the moon with the Kamehameha Wave--from the Earth no less--I am sure they are packing hundreds of billions of nukes worth of power. Piccolo did it with a casual Ki blast. Anyone want to argue that Piccolo and Roshi are the strongest DBZ characters based on that feat? Goku and Vegeta never actually blew up any celestial bodies, but it is not an extreme extrapolation at all to say that they can if they wanted to. On Hulk's hand, the argument is that his power is directly proportional to how angry he is, but he has never been shown to be angry enough to where he could threaten a cosmic entity. Just because it is possible for him does not mean he can ever get that powerful. His current strongest incarnation is World Breaker Hulk, which does not have any actual planet busting feats either. That Dark Dimension thing he destroyed seemed pretty volatile already to me.

You say that hulk has not shown adequate strength even though he theoretically can and yet you praise vegeta for his theoretical potentials

 Originally Posted by wesleyv1 I'm pretty sure you just contradicted yourself there. You say that hulk has not shown adequate strength even though he theoretically can and yet you praise vegeta for his theoretical potentials I was trying to compare Vegeta's potentials to people claiming that Hulk would win because of his potential for limitless strength. He has not been shown to be that far down the line of his powers, so it cannot be used to compare. It is no different from people arguing that Vegeta is not at planet busting level because he has not been shown to do it even though evidence clearly suggest that he can. It is hard to argue potentials, but I am slightly leaning on Vegeta's side because his potentials are more quantifiable given established facts in the canon material. You have to admit that having the potential for limitless power is NOT a measure of power in any way because even if the road before you is endless, you still have to actually tread it to get anywhere. Technically, Vegeta, and Saiyans in general, have the potential for limitless power too. Every time they get close to death, they get stronger. There is no established limit to this. However, it does not help that Vegeta's displays of powers are so inconsistent to what he is supposedly capable of, making it hard to tell how strong he is. He is a lot like Superman in that regards, the victim of plot. Vegeta goes to time chamber with a bunch of senzu beans or Dende, hurt himself to near death, have Dende heal him or Senzu it up, and rinse and repeat until desired power level. Unlimited power!

 But vegeta has yet to show his true potential either. Granted he's shown glimpses of great power and strength but not of what you're implying

 Originally Posted by wesleyv1 But vegeta has yet to show his true potential either. Granted he's shown glimpses of great power and strength but not of what you're implying That is another thing. Vegeta can actually replicate the process to increase his own power at will, unlike Hulk. He has done it before during the Frieza Saga..., or tried to. I just think it is a fair assumption to say that if Master Roshi can destroy the moon by firing a Ki beam at it from the Earth (distance matters), and Vegeta is stronger than Master Roshi, then he should be able to achieve that as well at the least. How much energy does it takes to blow up the moon? Certainly in the range of billions of nukes (that we have). Unless Master Roshi is actually the strongest DBZ character.

 The issue here is that everybody is going off of "theories." The proof however is in the actual material being the manga, movies and anime Vegeta clearly gets his ass whooped by pretty much everybody. Now regardless of the "potential" to destroy planets, are we saying that because they Dbz characters didn't want to destroy the planets they were fighting on, they held back their power? So Vegeta could have easily beat Frieza, Perfect Cell, Buu, etc etc, but he sat there and let himself get beat up for the planet's sake? Vegeta may have the ability to blow planets up with layzoors and energy balls, but the manga, and anime proved that Vegeta royally sucks when it comes to hand to hand combat with anybody other than Goku. Which is in fact the hulks specialty. Also, while Saiyans get stronger the closer to death they are, the power is not realized until the are fully restored after that point. Meaning Vegeta would have to get beat down, then the hulk just sits idly by and lets him take a Sensu bean or some other way to heal himself. Based off they actual story when has vegeta ever done that?

 Why is this planet-destroying nonsense still going on? Let's entertain th idea that Vegeta can destroy a planet. He does it, and then what? He dies. Hulk survives as he has before. Hulk doesn't even have to do anything to kill Vegeta when the little squirt will do it all on his own.
