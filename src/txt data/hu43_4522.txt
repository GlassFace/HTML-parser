 Introduction, ramblings about anime, and a request for more
 @Kuze thanks for the suggestions, psycho pass was on my radar and I think I'm gonna bump it up to next after I see if SAOII is any good. Also never heard of black lagoon I'll look into that. @Yoda Hmm, most video games I play are either FPS(I destroy at black ops) or fantasy RPG, so I'll give the next season of SAO a go, helps that I know Asuna will come back later half thanks for that. @FINAL I'd love to hear a theory about NGE if you wanna message me or direct me to a thread Thanks for the welcome posts everyone, I'll see you guys around the forums
