 Please don't turn this into 4chan/reddit, y'all. D: I don't mind an image macro now or then, but you're better than that guys. 

 Have to agree that if I want to see shitty image macros I'll go to le reddit. I got +0 LP in gold 1 for three wins in a row. I then lost one and went down by 6 points. The leagues system is very poorly done and the fact that there hasn't been more fan outrage over this just shows the profound level of dicksucking the average fan is willing to do to appease Phreak and other Riot workers. The system was introduced under the logic that in an ELO system a number like 1850 or 2000 or 1138 means nothing to the player because he/she doesn't understand where that places him/her in the rankings, so Riot introduced a leagues system where you're put into a group with a certain number of people and you climb up from there. This was supposed to make your progress transparent where at certain breakpoints you'd feel a sense of accomplishment, or even single wins would place you closer to your goal. Unfortunately in their application of the system they decided to tack on an unwanted hidden MMR system to restrict your progress if this number is not on par with your league ranking. I don't understand why they did this because they essentially took the old ELO system, hid it, put a bunch of banners and borders on new leagues, and then forced you to abide by the old rules anyway. At least previously when a player was 1633 he realized he was actually 1633 and a ways away from platinum. Now a player can be silver 1 or gold 1 and either be incredibly close to the next league or a very long way away. Using tools like LoLNexus or some other hidden MMR checkers you can kind of guesstimate where you actually stand but it makes my head hurt wondering why this should be necessary. Hopefully in season 4 this system dies. I haven't really had interest in playing League in a while so it doesn't matter much to me I guess, but with Riot consistently making a lot of really cool and well thought out changes I can't figure out why they've been so stubborn with their stance on hidden MMR.

In short, the ELO system is still here, and it's just pretty now, and hopefully they redo all of this in season 4. Just to put that in perspective for people who don't want to read a giant paragraph. (No insult intended in this) 
 It wasn't one giant paragraph... -_- 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

(No insult intended in this) Thanks for the tl;dr, but anybody who can't read two paragraphs is probably going to end up mixing concrete for the rest of their life.

 Yes, I'm butthurt because I apparently don't know how to count or pay attention to posts longer than a single paragraph and now am lashing out in embarrassment and quickly redirecting the conversation. Oh wait, I seem to have gotten myself all mixed up. How clumsy of me.

 @Voli, Nope. Katarina is too easy to shut down with cc. Sure she CAN be OP, but so can everyone. I'd much rather vs a fed kat when i'm mid, than a fed nasus which is 2x tankier AND has cc AND pretty much does the same damage. Speaking of damage... My team fed so hard, that even as a 12-3 leblanc, I became 12-4 because the enemies' fed tryndamere 2 hit me. Literally. No spin required. Keep in mind, he was not as fed as I was, I could full hp nuke him before he had the chance to ulti. The one time he manages to ulti, I got 2 hit. Obviously, I lost that game.

 Yeah most champions have pretty easy ways to deal with Kat these days, either CC or a blink they can use to get away from her. 

 I can't even remember the last time I saw a Kat outside of aram.

 I thought I might give Kat another try a few months ago so I picked her up, practiced her in bot games a few times, and then took her to some normals. There is absolutely no reason to play the champion anymore. She's been completely outshined by everything else. She's not even that good at countering Karthus anymore which was something she was very good at a while ago. She's really in the Warwick tier of champions at the moment. Sure she CAN be OP, but so can everyone. May want to rethink your logic there buddy. 
 Got disqualified from a tournament for using two subs in the first match. We made it to the quarter finals and they suddenly told us we were disqualified. Best tournament EU. Got disqualified after this game, PEOPLE BE AFRAID OF 3000 ELO SHOCKWAVES

 Lol, I thought the reason in having subs was to NOT get disqualified. GG.

 Takera I can complain to the European tards for you. Are you gonna try out for any European LCS teams? Because I think you would do a fantastic job. 

 me trying to be as cool takera ill get it someday! No but seriously lee sin jungle is so fun. Anything else is just boring. anything not skillshot is pretty boring to play now really. 
 Got to 99pts and lost one game with a diamond 1 smurf on the other team named Hao. -14pts... What does riot expect me to do? Seriously?

I dont think I am at LCS level yet in terms of knowledge and consistency (I play very inconsistently) for now I am just going try win some small tournaments with my current team and try to get to challenger with them Originally Posted by BlackTemplar Got to 99pts and lost one game with a diamond 1 smurf on the other team named Hao. -14pts... What does riot expect me to do? Seriously? They expect you to bash him into the ground. Originally Posted by Zer0 me trying to be as cool takera ill get it someday!

Not bad! learn to use a sightstone and you will get a lot better at Lee Sin quickly. btw, I never buy a locket on Lee, feels like an overrated item for the price really. You can get so much tankier if you skip locket. better to just leave the locket for support to buy.

Warmogs maybe? and yeah I can see how sightstone can be useful with getting away from the enemy. how early do i get it?

In arranged its probably the first item you should be getting. In YoloQ you can get it after or midway through Spirit of the Ancient golem.

 Sorry about the image macros. I tucked them away in a spoiler, if that's any better. The League system is also getting a lot of changes for season 4, or so Riot claims. And Kat is terrible. I play her a lot in Dominion for sh*ts and giggles. :3 *EDIT: Tak is god.
