 Can Americans Make Anime?

In america animes are still seen as a product made for children (see the censorships they often apply) and their concept of "comics" is really too different and far from "mangas". A comicbook is made of auto conclusive stories and arcs, different artists and authors contribute with their own style, making a comic character a ***** in a gangbang. They just can't think of a single author/artist writing an unified plot product which eventually ends, it is not in their mindset, where characters and stories are just eternal. Most anime isn't for kids because some Anime is inappropriate..
