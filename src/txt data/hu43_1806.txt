Oh, and its gonna between Germany or Spain but....I think its gonna be a South American team. Not Brazil. Columbia? Yep....to bad for Egypt. I wanted Egypt go to WC. But this 6-1 is kinda hard to turn around. Hmm...to bad for Turkey did not make it. I'm rooting for Brazil ALL THE WAY! And also Colombia in this tournament. Also Portugal IF they survive the PlayOffs. Colombia!? I think maybe they will made it until Round of 16. They still have a lot of problems in defense. No way. I'm tired of Spanish bullshit.

 Belgium's got a good and upcoming squad. They can fancy the quarterfinals. My personal favorite is Germany and I can't stand Tiki Taka no matter how many trophies it accumulates for Spain. Germany are only missing a key striker. I hope Klose becomes all time top scorer in the World Cup. He's just short by 2 goals. Can Max Kruse deliver in his first World Cup? Let's see. This World Cup is gonna be pretty fun. 
 Sweden 2-3 Portugal JUST...give the Balon D'Or to C.Ronaldo!!!!!

 http://imgur.com/a/Dtgyn Sick assist by Moutinho. It would be a travesty if Ronaldo doesn't get the balon dor. Messi might even finish behind Ribery if he stays injured, lol. Shame Ibra can't bow out on the biggest stage. ;.; 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 The last goal by Ronaldo was pretty sick. I like ibrahimovic and I absolutely hate Ronaldo and it kind of sucked for sweden, they rushed way too much on their offense instead of taking advantage of their lead, thats why they were able to do counters with Ronaldo. France vs Ukraine was just lolz. One of the goals shouldn't have counted cuz offsite but whatever. I don't understand why they are so hype as if they haven't been in the world cups for the last 20 years. 
 Blatter's "good boy" Messi can still bag that Ballon D'or only if the voting is rigged.

 Don't underestimate Belgium. They'll probably qualify. Group B and D looks feisty. Dare to place your bets for England being toppled over by Uruguay?

Belgium really should destroy both of them and that group. Anyway, I think B and of course ****ing D are the hardest groups. Feel sorry for US as well, they're gonna need a miricle to progress. I'll make a proper post later. Damn only 6 months to go!!!

 Okay here's the official world cup song. Pretty debatable. I think the song's okay but it could have done with a bit more energy. Certainly expected P-bull to shout out Mr. Worldwide. The beginning's good but then the song loses the momentum.  Spoiler For me the Coca Cola's version is a much much better theme song  Spoiler

I think the best WC song so far for me was Cup Of Life of Ricky Martin from France98.

 yep. I want some good theme like Dario G's for the '98 world cup. The last couple of ones were imho horrible. Glad to see my country open the competition against Brazil, will be a spectacle most definitely. As for favorites, i think Germany's had it with being in the top 4 without the trophies. They have the best overall team.
