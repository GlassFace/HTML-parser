[Fantasy] Yuri Kuma Arashi (Love Bullet: Yuri Kuma Arashi)
 Yuri Kuma Arashi (ユリ熊嵐, "Yuri Bear Storm") is a Japanese anime television series produced by Silver Link and directed by Kunihiko Ikuhara. The series was first announced via a website in August 2012, where it was referred to as the "Kunihiko Ikuhara/Penguinbear Project". The series will begin airing on MBS' Animeism programming block in January 2015. A manga adaptation with art by Akiko Morishima began serialization from February 2014 in Gentosha's seinen manga magazine Comic Birz. The TV anime will be helmed by Kunihiko Ikuhara (Sailor Moon, Revolutionary Girl Utena, Penguindrum), with animator Etsuko Sumimoto adapting manga tie-in author Akiko Morishima's original character designs on the Silver Link production. The story focuses on Kureha Tsubaki, a transparent girl who encounters a transfer student named Ginko Yurishiro who, upon their first meeting, seems to be whisper "I am a bear". Ever since, Kureha starts having strange dreams in which Ginko is a bear, and starts to wonder whether or not she is human. Some time ago, the asteroid Kumaria exploded in the depths of space. The resulting fragments became a meteor shower that rained down on Earth, and for some reason, bears all over the world rose up and attacked humanity! In "Man vs. Bear," the bears ate the humans and the humans shot the bears, resulting in a seemingly unending battle and a cycle of hatred. In the end, a giant "Wall of Extinction" was erected between the humans and bears and a state of mutual nonaggression came to pass... The human world. One morning, Arashigaoka Academy students Kureha Tsubaki and Sumika Izumino were by themselves and saw the "Yuri Flower" that bloomed in a flower bed. The two are friends as well as lovers. The flower bed is an important place to the two. At that moment, the Bear Alarms ring out! The bears are invading the human world, and humans are being attacked! Are they really those bears? One mystery invokes yet another mystery, one after another. The curtain rises magnificently on Yuri Kuma Arashi! This series is listed under both yrui and seinen. It's bound to be good, lol. :3

 This show reminds me so much of Mawaru Penguindrum that I will be sticking with it for that reason alone, I loved Mawaru Penguindrum and I'm sure I'll love this.

 Im excited for this anime(have already seen two episodes) and I know it's supposed to be a metaphorical anime but I am waiting for them to clear things up. Great art, awesome opening, and hopefully Kureha will get a lot of development

 I'm trying to decode all that metaphorical stuff, still the show is great and I will continue watching.

 The only thing that made me watch this are the bears. They are really cute and I love the way they "growl-growl". Yeah, stupid reason . . . I was able to watch Sakura Trick and Mawaru Penguindrum so maybe I can handle it.
