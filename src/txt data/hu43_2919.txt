 Leg squats - are your feet supposed to stay flat?
 Ok I'm really working on losing weight and generally toning my body. So I'm starting to do leg squats - 10 to 20 sets a day. Are you supposed to keep your feet flat as you go down? I saw some videos on youtube but I had them on mute. So I don't know if you are supposed to keep the feet flat as you go down. I guess it makes more sense to keep em flat so you are stretching more than if you bring the heels up as you go down. Also any other good leg workouts please feel free to share. Thanks. Fyi I'm cutting back on pop (soda) and snacking and riding a stationary bike a half hour every day now (started Sunday). I'm serious about it this time. It's a serious commitment. And I'm drinking more water than I have been and am working on eating better overall.
