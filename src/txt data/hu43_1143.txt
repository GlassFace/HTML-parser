[Action] Kill La Kill
 The blurb kind of puts me in mind of Girls und Panzer, but with swords rather than tanks. I may have to check it out once it finishes airing. (I hate watching series' that aren't finished because if I get into them I watch everything available, then have to wait for the rest >.> I like to marathon things)
