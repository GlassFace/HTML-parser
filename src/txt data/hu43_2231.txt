 New Generation of Consoles
 So how many rushed out to get or plan to get the PS4 or the Xbox One? Was this a good time for new consoles to get released? If you have one of these systems- how does it perform? Personally, at this moment I have no plans to get either system. I know it might be an unpopular statement but that's how I feel. As much of a gamer as I am, I just can't justify forking out the money right now when I still have a lot of gaming to do on my current systems. I personally feel that they could have waited on a new generation (with the exception of Nintendo). The last gen sytems were really hitting a nice stride and they feel a need to replace them. I just feel that if there was nothing wrong, why fix it? Also the prices of the new systems are just too much for my budget. Way too pricy. So what are your thoughts on this issue? 
 I am waiting for a 100 drop in ps4 and a 200 drop in x1.

 The only thing wrong with the release timing of the new generation of consoles was the limited number of new generation of games. Most games for the PS4 and X1 were already available for the PS3 and 360, and while there are marked improvements to those games on the new consoles, they're not new, and not terribly good reasons to get the new consoles so soon. The next 2-3 months will change that, but at release there just wasn't a lot to offer that didn't already exist. That said, I got a PS4. I really wanted to play Battlefield 4 and Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag, but I felt like I would be wasting my time and money getting them for the PS3 when I planned on getting a PS4 no matter what anyhow, so I just got a PS4 and those games for it (in the case of BF4 it was a wise choice, as despite all of the game's problems across all systems, it runs like complete **** and will forever do so on the PS3 and 360). I don't regret it at all. Love the games, BF4 especially, love the controller to death, and love the PS4's XMB, which is slick as **** (aside from one minor irritant that may be changed in a future update). I have a lot to look forward to, as well. I've still been playing my PS3 more lately, as obviously I only have two PS4 games (and two PSN games: Resogun and Don't Starve: Console Edition), and I've been chugging through a backlog of PS3 games. PS4 isn't going anywhere, though.

 I bought a PS4 early in January they're still sold out everywhere around me, although every has had Xboxes even on Xmas eve. Just no games out I'm interested in I'll probably get Metal Gear in March. I said I was gonna wait to get one till the 2nd gen of consoles dropped, I mean I knew there wasn't any games out that interested me but Wal-Mart just got a couple in when I called so I had them hold it and went and picked it up. I'll probably rent a few games as they're released and see if any are worth getting but Metal Gear is definitely the only for sure purchase right now for me. I did just read Sony has confirmed there will be over 100 games released this year. Microsoft hasn't made any such claims that I'm aware of, though I imagine they'll be somewhere in that range as well. 
 I'm waiting for halo5 before getting a xbox one. I will eventually get both but not until uncharted 4 is out for the ps4. It might not be until early next year though. Question - do your Xbox live downloaded games carry over to the Xbox one? I mean being able to redownload them without rebuying them. Sent from my Prism II using Tapatalk

Sent from my Prism II using Tapatalk They do not. Live games you've got on your 360 cannot be redownloaded onto your X1. It's the same for the PS3 and 4. Neither console is backwards compatible, and that includes 360 Live and PS3 PSN games.

By the way do they offer the same free games for gold members on the xbox one and the free games for playstation plus members on the next gen consoles? Or to put it another way do they have any free games, not necessarily the same ones? 
 Nope. They each have their own selection of free games each month. Right now the PS3 is obviously getting full release games for free, but the PS4 is just getting 1-2 free PSN games each month -- this month is Outlast, with last month's games being Resogun and Don't Starve: Console Edition. The PS4 likely won't be seeing many, if any, full release title games for free for quite a while. Most will likely be console versions of titles you'd see on the PC if not more PSN exclusive games. I assume the X1 is similar, but can't speak to the specifics.

 Thanks struggler. 
 Theres a whole lot of nothing, to be quite honest with you. I got the One on launch and pretty much ran through Dead Rising 3, Forza and what ever else I could find and have already migrated back to my PC to play a ton of FFXIV. The PS4 is no better either, in terms of new games, Microsoft is doing a better job of that. What I mean is, in terms of exclusives and titles which aren't ports or re-releases, Sony is sucking big time, but to be quite fair as well, within a year, the PS4 will make a mockery of the One. Don't get me started on the Wii U. I got it 1 FULL YEAR after it was released and there are STILL no games for it. I don't even particularly care if it's a 1st party or even 3rd party title... just... anything that ISN'T MARIO or LUIGI, christ... Nintendo. Give us another Fire Emblem, Zelda, Metroid... I'll even play a console version of Nintendogs... I don't even care. Just SOMETHING that isn't Mario.

 I don't know if it's just me, but this new generation doesn't give me that feeling of a huge leap forward like it did with PS2 after PS1 or the generation before.Maybe cause I ain't a kid anymore so I don't get impressed that easily Anyways, I'm on PS4 side, nostalgia driven if nothin else. But in my experience, never buy the first or the first two models after the release. Always some hardware issues that get resolved in the later models. As for the games, I'm only really interested in MGS and SKATE. So i might even go after the XBOX cause they are multiplatform, who knows. The exclusives list will decide in the end 
 I'm interested in the loading times of the new consoles. How are they in games? Are both consoles any faster on load times than the previous models? Sent from my Eclipse-X using Tapatalk

 I plan on just keeping my PS3 :P Maybe when all the new things come out for the new generation consoles, things will be cheaper for the PS3 lol! 
A scattered dream that's like a far off memory... A far off memory that's like a scattered dream... I wanna line the pieces up... yours, and mine...
 @yoda The load times are pretty obscene to be honest with you. There's a reason why both consoles require you to install the games onto the hard drive before you can play them. Streaming all that data from the disc is going to be pretty absurd. If it's any indication, most of the load times are pretty similar to how they are with the PSP. Once enough of the game data is loaded, however, it's pretty decent given that both the One and PS4 have generous pools of memory. It's also safe to say that this is only unique to the first year or two of the generation as developers figure out how to optimize for each console. @ryoden To be honest, unlike the previous 2 generations, getting rid of your PS3 or 360 isn't quite worth it. There are still plenty of amazing games that you can play and I still hop on my PS3 and 360 from time to time even though I own both new consoles. Something that I've been trying to do more of is actually hitting up every game I can get that is $9.99 and cheaper, even if it may be a C / 70% / 2-3 out of 5 Star kind of game. You'd be surprised how amusing it is to go back to games that aren't AAA titles.

 @shian kirin - thanks for the info. By the way its not a full 40gb install off the bluray is it? Is it still just 4 or 5gbs like the ps3 for installs? That would totally suck if you have to install the whole damn bluray. ---------------------------------------------------- I have to own a new console now after seeing this: http://ca.ign.com/videos/2014/03/21/...teaser-trailer I WANT IT NOW!!!! Yes I'm an assassins creed junky. I have black flag but only on the ps3 - which is great but not "blown away next gen" great. Yes I know its available for the ps4 now but the next one will have a chance to fully utilize the next gen power. Damn got save up for it now more than ever........ 
 I'll buy the ps4 when the price for the console and game drops. I mean what's the point of getting the new gen if all the games are so damn expensive? I'll stick with my ps3 because the games are alot cheaper I'll take gameplay over graphics 
Fool me once shame on you fool me twice f*ck you Patches

Games last gen were more expensive than the one before it, yet games haven't gotten any more expensive with the new generation.

 I will get a ps4 in about 2 years or so. I might get a Xbox one but I dunno. Its just not wowing me like it used too! I hate the controller and Its kind of like the Wii. It wowed me in theory and all the specs and bells it showed off. The games looked pretty good too! However, after the Wii launched I had a sudden no desire to ever own one or play any of the games and I still have not done so. Except play a couple of games my friends had. Smash bros, the zelda series, Everything. I have no intention on ever really getting a X1 now or ever. It might change but I don't know. Even titan fall and the other big titles like Killer instinct has no appeal to me.

 I'm hoping to get a PS4 in September.. My Family don't have a lot of Money, So I'm asking for a PS4 for my 18th.. Not interested in parties / drinking.. So I'm thinking it'll be cheaper for them if that's what I go for. Personally, the biggest reason for getting the PS4 over the Xbone is not the money but the games. I'm a HUGE fan of the Uncharted series, The Infamous Series. Looking forward to playing Infamous Second Son, keeping away from gameplay and spoilers online.. And these as far as I know are only going to be on PS4... Is it true that Titanfall on Xbone has a 50gb install? 
 Originally Posted by Narippo-KatekyoBleachborn Is it true that Titanfall on Xbone has a 50gb install? Only 20gb on the X1. It's 48gb on PC, though, with I think around 34gb of that being just audio.

 My god!Thays still very big in my opinion. From the reviews I've seen it's not as good as it was hyped up to be either... 
 Originally Posted by Struggler They're the same price as any new PS3/360 game. Games last gen were more expensive than the one before it, yet games haven't gotten any more expensive with the new generation. It's still 60 bucks right? That's way too much for me It'll nice if it's 49.99

 I was planning on selling my ps3 to get a ps4 because I figured the ps4 would eventually replace it. My ps3 is building up dust and I don't really play it mostly because I don't have many new games on it. The problem with the ps3 is probably its hardware, developers complain about it and this was evident in skyrim. It was super laggy at times and it had several problems so If I do ever get it I'm looking forward to the improved experience overall. Ps4 games I'm interested in: Assasins creed black flag (I stopped on the series on brotherhood for no reason), Watchdog, Batman: arkham knight, Destiny, and actually the first time ever I can say I'm kind of interested in that new FF game. Everyone and their mother plays/knows this game but I never get into it or cared for it. That said the visuals are amazing but thats like the only thing square enix is good at.

 When you install Titanfall, it decompresses the audio off of the disc and stores it on your hard drive. For performance, it was actually faster for Respawn to stream the audio completely raw. Basically, what they were saying is that instead of using extra processing to decompress those files on the fly, they felt it was better served for other elements such as graphics and game play. -- To be quite honest, Titanfall isn't that great. It's a fun game and all, and it deserves the review scores it gets, but generally speaking, the only mode that will keep the game afloat in a "eSport" setting is Titan Last Stand. There is virtually no strategy involved in any other mode and what makes Titan Last Stand so fun is the amount of communication required along with skill and teamwork. If you ever played a match of Counter-Strike, that single mode brings the mentality of Counter-Strike into it. The other problem with Titanfall is not allowing players to have their own servers. The game will most likely be short lived and Respawn squashed most player's ability to make modifications so you can't have an eSport scene if you wanted to since you can't exactly queue a team against another team by choice.
