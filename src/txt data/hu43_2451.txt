 Damn Minashi, learn to respect personal privacy/bubbles! Damnit Mahmu, you're like the second most annoying weak-willed female in this cast. ...Wtf it looked like Susan was being raped. Akashi's going into those Mass Effect 3 dream sequences, xD. Aw, Mahmu you're so cute. Eyyyy, that *****'s still as smug as ever in even rest. HA, those regular Vesses looked funny when they were shooting and wheeling. Youch, Mahmu! That has got to sting and ache. Great resole, Mahmu! It's like David and Goliath right now, and that ending appearance! 
 Nice ability Akashi, now ****ing use it to its fullest. xD that fall was such a derp! Even Heito knows how ****ing lame it was, after all that dramatic staring from a high location too! Minashi, oh **** off you're so god damned invasive. Minashi has that wild, wide look in his eyes...damn, I think he's gone. Rise, Argent-- ascend once more. Minashi...how could you go against Sasame you ****?! Akashi, please make Minashi into a blood-eagle or something. *sigh* Why don't both of you bad boys just ****ing take Tsugumi, she's like mega willing...wait, Akashi's faithfulness to Sasame would be broken then. No can do, Akashi **** Minashi up and try to break things off with Tsugumi for good, you're a bachelor for life. Rock em Sock em, Akashi, nice upper-cut! Wooooah, what is this Warhammer 40K massive **** going on?! Tsugumi, put your damn breasts away already. Epic cliff-hanger. 
 Akashi x Heito. It's gonna happen.

 Woah Minashi, that hand is ****ed up. Despite his crazy desires, Minashi is speaking the truth...he's seen a lot of **** and just wants it to end. Oh look at that gay flag, it's okay because SASAME COMES TO THE RESCUE. Wiah that music kick-up around eleven minutes was awesome. Yeah you *****, Corpse was a bro who kept quiet and only ever showed you affection and loyalty, he was the Best Friend character in Dating Simulator Games. ...Oh my god the credit scenes ARE SO GOOD I LOVE THEM. Especially that last one...with Sasame...and Akashi... ;~; Oh **** that was awesome. Loved this anime. It had drama, romantic intrigue, and also a tame yet still decent amount of terror. Awesome watch. 
 I loved the ending narration. Darkness is never born as Darkness. It is born when light is lost. The same is said for the darkness within one's heart. The light was here. Surely, it was here.
