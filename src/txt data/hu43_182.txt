 Gun Talk (No hating, plz)
 Thread to talk about your guns. Any other gun owners on FA? I know probably 65% of A4 are probably too young to own, but I will ask anyway. I have a Glock 26, and while it's kinda tiny, I love it. I want an FS92 when I can, and will probably buy a lil Cobra 22LR for my sock when I have the money. Someday when I have a house with a bigger safe, i'd like to get an FS90 and a Winchester 1894 ($2000). Any others? Feel free to post pictures and talk about your guns. I wanna know!
