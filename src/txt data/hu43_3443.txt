 Oh, after reading other character sheets, I noticed my character is fairly similar to the already created Howard Strey. I see a handful of ways to fix this; Mana could be a different developed series, could be a different organisation completely with a different purpose since I never stated a name or I could just do something else. I'll leave the final decision up to you Shmuser. lol, it was a lucky find for me Kuze since it was roughly what I had in mind when I thought; on-job appearance for artificial super soldier/assassin.
