 "My Valentine" Expression Event, A4 Twist
 Do you have someone that you want to express your feelings or even declare your love to? Well now it's your chance, and you can do how you like; whether it's graphics, written, voice, or instrumental, and such, aslong it's appropriate. Here's the twist, it can only be someone on A4 and whose active. They're two ways of submission; 1) Are you feeling ambitious? Just post it here, or 2) Are you feeling nervous? PM me the submission and you will remain anonymous until the revealing. From there, we will be having a poll to those who submitted their entries (FEB-08 to FEB-13), and than on Friday, February 14 (Valentine's Day), the winner will be revealed. Let's get to the rules: 1. You have until Friday, February 7th at 11:59 PM EST (check your local time) to submit your entry. 2. The entries cannot be inappropriate; automatic disqualification. (This is your warning) 3. Only one entry permitted. 4. It can be a joke or serious, aslong it's in good intention. 5. Please keep the spamming at a minimum. 6. Have fun and Good Love! 
What is a word made up of 4 letters, yet is also made up of 3. Sometimes is written with 9 letters, and then with 4. Rarely consists of 6, and never is written with 5.
