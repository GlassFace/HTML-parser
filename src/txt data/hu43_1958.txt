 A4 Broadcast - Nov 17
 Next week the A4 Broadcast will return, bringing with it more overly long conversations about anime both new and old as well as some discussions regarding video games. Here's the low-down: The Forums. We'll talk about where the forum is and any relevant news, events, or great threads we'd like the highlight.Anime. Last week we talked extensively about Coppelion, Hajime no Ippo, and Attack on Titan. This week we'll be focusing on Golden Time and Samurai Flamenco, as well as whatever else happens to pop up as the conversation progresses.Video Games. Last week we never got to this but, with the coming of the next-gen consoles upon us, we figured we should have a talk about what we're in for. We'll also be talking about League of Legends, the most popular game on this here forum. As with last week, the whole thing should run for about an hour and a half. Be sure to subscribe to Shian's Twitch.tv account so that you know the moment we go live, or just keep an eye on A4's Facebook page throughout the day for further updates. As before, your hosts will be Ian the Korean, Shian Kiri, and myself. We hope to see you when we go live!
