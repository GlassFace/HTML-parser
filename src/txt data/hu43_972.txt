[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires

I'm sure he's being pressured, and is fighting the turmoil and conflict within himself. So on the surface Arus will have to align with the Council, but there is a chance that they will try to rebel? Or the president might even sacrifice himself to personally fight back. All seem like likely possibilities! I've never thought of that, I always thought of him as a rat. xD If he does anything that will upset the Council, he's ****ing dead or he will turn into one of them . He probably doesn't want that, so he is most likely to cooperate with the council. You are right, so many possibilites and we're watching vvv so expect everything! NO LIMITS.

He is that type of character, that you just want to bash his head in. also Evangelion 1.11 shinji is (not) a pussy, by that I mean he is.
