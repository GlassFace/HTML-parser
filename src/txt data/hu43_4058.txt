 Katawa Shoujo - Three Stars (Piano Cover)

Anyway, good job, and nice to meet a fellow Katawa Shoujo enthusiast... never seem to find many. :-) Thanks for listening. I learned it by sheet music. I love the entire OST. I do plan on learning Wiosna sometime though, and I'd love to learn Romance in Andante, it's one of my favourite pieces.
