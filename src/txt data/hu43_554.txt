[General Discussion] Spamming [READ PLEASE]
 Okay guys, bumping this up. Now that September is here, the chat thread is gone, please don't turn other threads in GNAD into chat threads by spamming. If what you are posting isn't based on the OP, or doesn't add discussion value to the direction of a thread, then don't post it. If it's a side conversation with another member, this is spam. Please take it to visitor messaging and continue your joking there. Today I've deleted a bunch of derailing posts. People cannot post in threads that have been spammed. It seems pointless, so again, don't do it. 
 Do you RP, or are you interested in learning? Join our Role Player's Society here on A4. Would you like a baseball bat to shove up your ass along with that stick? You're a mod, please act like one A4 is on FACEBOOK
