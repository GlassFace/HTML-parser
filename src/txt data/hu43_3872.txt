 Looking for appropriate manga/anime for my 9 year old girl
 My daughter has recently fallen in love with Manga/anime. it started with Hatsune Miku and has snowballed from there. I do not discourage her since I grew up on Astroboy and Akira. What at are some age appropriate anime and manga for her to consume? She wants a very female cast. So so far she has read 1-5 of Fruits Basket, all of Tokyo Mew Mew, some ChocoMimi. She he has been watching mostly Sailor Moon, but we tried to watch Trinity Seven and it started with a boob grab, then we watched sword Art Online, boob grab came in episode 8 or 9. She also likes Fairytale but feels like they focus on the boys too much sometimes. I am am looking for something age appropriate for her, on Crunchyroll or Netflix. (Subbed or dubbed doesnt matter) I just want a strong female lead without some of the innuendo or fan service for her. Any help would be much appreciated, on both the manga and Anime side.
