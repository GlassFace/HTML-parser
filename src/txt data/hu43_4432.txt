[Anime] Badass OP protag anime recommendations
 So since everyone's version of "badass" is subjective, I'm thinking along the lines of Tatsuya Shiba from Mahouka Rettousei, the medicine seller from Mononoke or for some subtler ones would be Kazuki Fuze from "Jin Roh". I'm not looking for any particular genre or gender but I'm definitely hoping for action of some sort. I'm not into the HXH, DBZ generic shounen that take a beating every time in order to "unleash" whatever. What I'm looking for ordinary characters, male or female that go straight up into god-mode when fighting/dealing with situations/whatever. 
What can we say now? Our mouths only lying, we rise from the dying.
