 Well, Hello There
 Hi there, guys. Um, I'm carcinoGeneticist and I am a person. Sorry, I never know what to write in these introductions. I have been interested in anime and manga for about a year and a half and my favorite animes at the moment are Hetalia and Attack on Titan. Um, I'm a huge pushover and it might take me a while to feel comfortable on this forum. Well, that's it. I hope to become acquainted with some of you guys and not be annoying.
