 Anyone else think Miley Cyrus puts out Good Music? - Page 4
 Well yeah, there's not really much depth in it considering there around thousands of songs out there that focus on the exact same theme. Changing the metaphors don't give it additional depth. Also according to Wikipedia, Wrecking Ball was written by five people. Even if I didn't do better, I'd be a better writer by default considering each of them only did 20% of the work :P

I'm still smirking as I type this, "Yay, depth" hahahaha nice once but yes, it really does have depth in the wording/writing. Get over yourself, or let me see you do better. :P It's a song about heartbreak if "just listen to the lyrics" as you've spouted time and time again. After all that listening it seems the intended message still never got through to you.....

 It's a song about love, i.e. a love song. Considering I was replying to her sentence stating "you broke my heart," you really think your post was necessary, Chic?

To prove a point yes. You previously refused one of my previous statements regarding the problems with the video you posted as well as why you're heralding it as the end all be all in music. You calling I a "love song" kinda proves my assumption right. And "you broke my heart" almost literally says "heart break" (what I said) not "Love song" which is still what you think it's about.... Love song carries a specific connotation that you're just not understanding.

 Hate to "break" it to you but Heart break falls under the category of love. ergo it's a love song. Love isnt all sunshine and puppy dogs so why should love songs be any different? 
  Spoiler  Spoiler 
 Normally when people say love song it carries a specific connotation and normally it's a positive one. Heart break is the opposite.

 But heartbreaks are a part of love

 I'm almost certain this is a better representation of what's being discussed. I'd rather jam to this than Wrecking Ball, despite how seemingly good WB is. Though, that's just me; everyone has different likes/perceptions, etc. :3 I'm just the kind that hates songs where girls get all sad and instead don't stand up and be all like "yo, i'm good without you, and i'm going to have fun!" I don't dig that crying stuff after heartbreak. lol.  Spoiler

 Ironic thing is, it seems Miley is stronger than ever without Liam, and P!nk definitely seems to have her person and emotions exxxxxtremely invested in Carey, so much so that when they go through road bumps she breaks down and writes awesome love/breakup songs. lol That being said, I'll be the first to say P!nk is more talented, awesome, and seemingly levelheaded then Miley. However, still, Miley is who she is and comparing her to someone so defined at this point in her career is unfair. 
 With the man hair and the past history of gigs, I find it terribly hard not to immediately form that image when I hear anything of hers. I barely remember any songs she's made since she showed up on Disney channel anyway.

However, I know a girl who's first name is Aineda, and last name is Dix. Which when pronounced sounds exactly like "I need a dicks". Her parents are pretty much the worst people just because of that name. my manga list

I hope you're not misunderstanding me posting Pink there as a form of comparing, but merely just my preference between the two. Not comparison. The first person I'd listen to if I'm going through a rough time would be P!nk, definitely not Miley. And despite her exterior, I'm more than certain she's on a breakdown much like P!nk can be. But Miley just says "eff the haters, eff Liam," when in reality we all know people who say that are actually in much deeper hurt than they let on. P!nk just let's you know straight up what's what. lol.

P!nk just let's you know straight up what's what. lol. Nah, people CAN move on quickly and smoothly, it's all about the mindset, and what you've got going on in your life. Sure, she says "F the haters" but, looking at her actions, we can see that she actually has conviction in not giving a fudge, and with everything she is going through, it may be very well that her memory of Liam isn't a important to her anymore. Also Miley tells it how it is as well mostly, she can just be a little more wild/ridiculous than P!nk(which says a lot lol).

I just don't get that feeling from her .. well judging by her actions anyway, as they should speak a lot via that saying that goes around, "actions speak louder than words." And her actions don't speak very well to me.

 But how she acts doesn't necessarily reflect her state of mind.

 Originally Posted by wesleyv1 But how she acts doesn't necessarily reflect her state of mind. Eh... actually, actions do usually (most times) reflect ones state of mind. lol. Sometimes words too, depending, but.. I think your perception on that statement just might change with some other [perhaps more criminal] cases. lol. Though, it's really not relevant to this thread as a whole, so I won't discuss it, because it'll probably derail this thread more and I don't want that. >.<'

 It's true actions do speak louder than words but consider this wise men say belive half of what you see and none of what you hear.

 I think her music got way better. Remember the Hannah Montana music, right? The new Miley makes awesome music indeed

And her actions don't speak very well to me. Miley is obv not ok and neither is P!nk. I mean if you are ok after a major break up then you didn't really care about the other person. I just love how everyone thinks Miley is acting so outragous now....I must be desensitized to this **** or something lol 
 Nice guys are the reason you can't have guy friends. Sowy @Pass_the_M

I think you might be desensitized though... then again you are also male, bruddah~ XD

 One of my faves by her: 
 I love how people kept comparing her to lady gaga when that one came out

 Originally Posted by Raven Dove One of my faves by her: At first, I didn't like that song/mv, but after awhile of thinking about it, and taking time to watch it again in comparison to now.. frankly, I prefer that Miley to this Miley. D: That's better than her newer stuff because at least it had some good symbolism and things I could relate to somewhat - er no, not being a bird. Not that.

 I wouldn't say common as much as I'd say uncommon
