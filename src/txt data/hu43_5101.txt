 Code Lyoko
 I really enjoyed Code Lyoko. When the debate whether anime can only be made in Japan is brought up with friends, I point to Code Lyoko as a point on the matter. I enjoyed the show all the way to its latest season, when they decided to stupidly drop animation to cut costs and air it live action.
