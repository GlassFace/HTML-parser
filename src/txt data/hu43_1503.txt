 Anyone else think Miley Cyrus puts out Good Music? - Page 3

When I saw the video, it didn't seem as trashy as some of you say, and it isn't different than any other music video where the images shown seemingly have nothing to do with the lyrical content at all.

The average girl her age would have had a severe mental breakdown by now. e.g. Britney. The difference between Miley/Britney Spears then and the average girl of the same age is that the average girl can't afford a breakdown. She is ultimately choosing a "path to greatness" that if taken by any other girl in the same age group with little to no money would end up with drug usage and or pregnancy.

A breakdown isn't something you choose, and they work out worse for famous people being in a spotlight of the media. Now your last sentence makes zero sense to me. First of all how would a broke girl end up in her position to choose that path(on her level)? And drugs and pregnancy has nothing to do with how you act on stage, in a music video, etc--You can say "it's part of the lifestyle" but really it all gets mixed in by choice of the person. 
 Yes. However her attire and official video wise say something else about her.. 
Answer my call, Dark Spear.

 94? That's not that many. Masami Akita has 536 albums. 

 Originally Posted by Doctor Strange 94? That's not that many. Masami Akita has 536 albums. Still more than 11.

 To put it bluntly, no. However, this is just a matter of personal taste and opinion. *shrug* 
What will it take to enlighten you? I've gone passed the edge and I'm already broken; How do I climb back to the brink and put myself back together again?
 Originally Posted by Mister Because quanity is everything. Quality is having an album where every song is loved by all. Composition, arrangement, everything is spot on. Do you like/love every song on every Miley album? How many people love damn near every song on every Zappa album?

 No. You were acting like quantity was so cool before. LOL MILEY ONLY HAS 3 ALBUMS ZAPPA HAS OMGZ. Get over yourself. Also, I'm sure every Merzbow fan loves most of his 500+ albums.

Number of albums can be used as a way to measure years in the industry as well as success. Decades ago, i suppose it was conceivable to release multiple albums per year but not necessarily a worthwhile venture because of time and commitment issues. If you weren't successful you stopped making albums. Even one hit wonders can make an album. Any marginal success was reason to continue until they could no longer afford to do so because the fanbase/popularity was not there.

 I never really liked Miley Cyrus's music to begin with. As for her new music, I really like Wrecking Ball. That's it.

Also, this Miley chick and her handlers know exactly what they're doing here. Don't like her depthless, sh1tty music? Thats probably because it isn't aimed at you. There's a market that thrives on hype and constantly being in the news/twitter. Shes one of the best at it. I mean, just look at this thread. Every mother****er who thinks they have 'good taste' in music is losing their sh1t. This girl got in bed with Disney before you could tie your shoe laces. She's been pimped by the best. And now she's going solo. She'll be fine. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro?

And now she's going solo. She'll be fine. Only her music isn't depth-less. If you can listen to the song I posted in OP and say that you should probably be using your thinking brain, as opposed to the brain you spew posts out of usually. I like how you're acting like all of her songs are about being a party animal or just plain stupid songs. Other than the disgusting way you put it, I agree with your second paragraph.

I like how you're acting like all of her songs are about being a party animal or just plain stupid songs. I don't normally watch music videos. Even if I youtube something, I end up listening to the song while I do something else in another tab. There are three problems with the video you posted: 1. Miley by all appearances seems to have fallen in the same trap many of her predecessors have: he idea that sex sales. When people look and listen to the video, they're predominantly going to be visually fixated on the images and no so much the lyrical content. Vision is one of the more advanced senses we have. Even with auditory stimuli, our brain is going to either tune out most of what she's saying to make sense of why they're seeing what they're seeing. I highly recommend you play the video with a blindfold on so you can listen to what she's saying. Which brings me to my next point: 2. She says that same thing over and over again. She says the hook at least 5 times with variation between "wreck" and "break". That accounts for 145 words out of 335. 335-145=190. Of those 190 any unique content reuses phrases from the chorus. Regardless of the overall message she was going for, this song is by no means a song of great "depth" if any at all. 3. This style is unique to the "pop genre" that targets teenagers of today. Giving how popular the song is you can make some assumptions about the target demographic: they like sex (visual), they have a short attention span, and or they think they an relate to Miley.

Giving how popular the song is you can make some assumptions about the target demographic: they like sex (visual), they have a short attention span, and or they think they an relate to Miley. Whether she is trying to sell sex, get more famous, or just express herself, regardless how does that change the song if you just actually listen and think on the lyrics? "Depth" can be used in much more than one way, and when talking about music, using the word as a substitute for "amount" is ridiculous. Depth in thinking and message was indeed achieved in this hit, and clearly you even somewhat alluded to knowing this by saying: "Regardless of the overall message she was going for" So I don't know why you're arguing this, perhaps you're just bored. Your #3 "assumptions" have zero base to them, complete bollocks. 
 Her videos have created some hilarious parodies and I can't say I hate either We Can't Stop or Wrecking Ball but, man some of the tracks on Bangerz are really really bad. Like SMS? is it the one with Britney Spears I can't bare to listen to Miley fail at rapping. That being said I feel like she had two choices make money or be a likable good singer. She decided to make money. And she is so is it the smart thing? Maybe who knows. Love her or hate her she's making more bacon than most like 99% of us.

Your #3 "assumptions" have zero base to them, complete bollocks. I did listen to the song. I actually like the song. Doesn't change the fact that the lyrical content is almost devoid of anything that could remotely be described as "depth" and doesn't invoke any desire to "think deeply on xyz subject" in me because I'm not the target demographic. Pop music. Short for Popular music. Largely aimed at teenagers. Tends and trends amongst teenagers does impact how things are marketed to them. I don't know why this is hard to understand.

Yay, depth.

Lol its a love song, so you shortening it to that doesn't say anything about the song. I'm still smirking as I type this, "Yay, depth" hahahaha nice once but yes, it really does have depth in the wording/writing. Get over yourself, or let me see you do better. :P
