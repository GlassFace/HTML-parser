[Mecha] Aldnoah.Zero
 Aldnoah.Zero (アルドノア・ゼロ Arudonoa Zero) is an upcoming anime television series produced by Nitroplus and animated by A-1 Pictures and TROYCA. The anime is scheduled to air in July 2014. The director will be Ei Aoki and the original creator is listed as Gen Urobuchi, both of whom had previously collaborated on Fate/Zero. Katsuhiko Takayama will be in charge of writing the scripts for the series. Hiroyuki Sawano will compose the music and Kalafina is credited with performing the opening theme song. The main cast was announced by Ei Aoki at AnimeJapan on March 22, 2014. Okay, I'm a little disappointed that they're doing another mecha instead of something else, but wow what an impressive staff list!! Gen Urobuchi is writing this, Ei Aoki directing it, Nitro+ is the producer, with A-1 and TROYCA animating. Even being a non-fan of mecha, this is bound to be good! I did enjoy Urobuchi's last mecha story he wrote for anime, Suisei no Gargantia (and of course I absolutely love his other works like Madoka Magica and Psycho-Pass). He must be going through a robot phase right now, lol. I remain excited for this one!
