 What are you currently Playing?
 ^ good to see you keeping up with yourself Forza 5 because Destiny keeps asking me to do so much with so little content, and then they pull the rug out from under you when you finally reached your goal, "hey guys now you can be level 33!"...... and the grinding process continues. Its kind of like taking a shower, feels good in the moment but you have to keep at it at least once a day to stay in top shape. Well I say **** being the best as long as I smell okay I'm happy *exhale*
