 STOP ALL OTHER NEWS: JUSTIN BIEBER ARRESTED FOR DUI OFFICIAL THREAd
 JUSTIN BIEBER ARRESTED FOR DUI (CNN) -- Justin Bieber was charged with drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license after police saw the pop star street racing early Thursday morning, Miami Beach police said. "What the f*** did I do? Why did you stop me?" Bieber asked the police officer who pulled him over just after 4 a.m., according to the arrest report. Bieber, 19, was released from a Miami jail an hour after he made a brief appearance through a video link before a Miami judge, who set a "standard" $2,500 bond Thursday afternoon. He strutted out of the jail dressed in black, with a baggy hoodie covering his head. His pants appeared to be baggy leather. Bieber briefly sat on top of a black Cadillac Escalade, where he waved to screaming fans, before he was chauffeured away. At the bail hearing, the singer, dressed in an orange jail uniform, stood silently with his lips sometimes pursed as attorney Roy Black represented him in the hearing earlier. Black told Judge Joseph Farina that he had been retained by Bieber's manager. He said his partner had been denied access to Bieber in jail before the hearing. Bieber was booked into a Miami jail after failing a sobriety test, Miami Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez told reporters Thursday. Bieber "made some statements that he had consumed some alcohol, and that he had been smoking marijuana and consumed some prescription medication," Martinez said. A Miami Beach officer saw Bieber driving a yellow Lamborghini in a race against a red Ferrari in a residential area of Miami Beach, Martinez said. The cars were speeding at about 55 to 60 mph in a 30 mph zone, he said. ... http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/23/sh...bieber-arrest/ VIDEO COVERAGE: 
 
 And there's the "I'm famous and rich so I can do whatever I want without consequence" mentality. I can't say I'm not surprised, but you'd think that he would have known better.

 Talk about "real" news. And here I thought the breaking news was about them riots in Kiev, Ukraine.

 The title had me cracking up, good one. Honestly, I usually care less for this punk.. but I couldn't help but laugh at this. He does need some serious help though, and I mean putting him into some system where it teaches him some humility, to be humble, etc. Oh... there isn't anything? Bummer.. Seriously though, I saw a side by side comparison of him and ... not surprisingly... Miley (+Ru Paul posted his edited mug shot with makeup) and I about lost it. Lol.

 He's over is head, like always. this is surely not the last of him being on the news, for all the wrong reasons.

 Well I think that everybody knew this was going to happen, considering how his behavior has been in the past and also because of the fact that the arrests that happened at his house a couple of days ago surprisingly didn't include him. I was annoyed by how much attention this was receiving. But again, that was not surprising either. Children getting immense fame, power, and wealth early in their lives, really don't have many people telling them "No" anyways.

That's pretty impressive.  Spoiler He's just that famous, people care about what they care about. Doesn't make him any more powerful in things like politics, etc than any regular Joe. Just because people act like this sh1t really matters, doesn't mean it's true. 
 If we have to stop all other news for this, I cannot imagine what would happen when we gets news of WW3 or E.L.E asteroid impact. You already stopped all other news for this. What else can you do?

 I've been living in a bottle and a toilet all day so this is the first I'm hearing about it. I thought this was some kind prank when I saw the thread title. Reading the thread... I can't say I care about Beiber's little escapade unless he were to have killed someone and got to serve time in a rehab/resort.... In other news. ZIMMERMAN!!!

I mean the guy can stop journalism on congress. That's pretty impressive. Technically, he would have to have been born in the borders of the United States to run for President. But, he could run for most other political offices. But I doubt he would. At this point, all that matters to him is partying and having a good time. And if you had the kind of money he does, you would probably be doing the same. Just another celebrity going crazy with their immense funds. This is nothing new nor is it that surprising.

 The dumbing down of society when this is top news. There are so many worse and important things going on in the nation and worldwide that get totally ignored.

 It's OK, congress only pretends to care anyways. Whatever it takes to placate the plebs. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them.

You should know that there are those of us who don't care about Bieber. Just the fact that the superbowl is next week. And that Richard Sherman's been trash talking in the media (quite hilarious).

Mmm hmm. A lot of people online talk about how this is a media atrocity, and that Justin Bieber's silly DUI case shouldn't be getting so much attention. They were the same people who jumped on the bandwagon and talked extensively about what he said about Anne Frank at her museum, and a bunch of other dumb **** that he did. When on big boards like le reddit threads about Justin Bieber routinely hit the top, it's no big shock that MSNBC would prioritize a feel good news story about his most recent ****up, seeing as these news channels frequently browse le reddit/Youtube to see what people are interested in. It's depressing, but the riots in Kiev are just not interesting to the average American. I can't imagine over 25% of Americans being able to even say what country Kiev is in.

It's depressing, but the riots in Kiev are just not interesting to the average American. I can't imagine over 25% of Americans being able to even say what country Kiev is in. There's a few news stories out there right now that are just a bit disconcerting. Ukraine's protests are kind of interesting as I've been reading it all started over their president backtracking on an EU trade deal on pressure from Russia. Ukraine's caught in the middle of a fight between two big fish looking for greater pieces of the pie. And Ukraine unfortunately relies on Russia for quite a bit of natural gas (typically used for home heating here and there I'm guessing). I've also been reading that China's interbank interest rates are also spiking just like ours did during the financial collapse, and their GDP numbers came in the weakest they have in a while (something like slowest growth since 1999). Seems like things are really starting to slow down there and people may freak out even more. Just a few big bankruptcies might do it... One of which is set for Jan 31, when a bankrupt coal mining company defaults on a $500 million loan and takes down the bank that made the loan. If China doesn't swoop in with hordes of cash to bail them out that is. But yeah, Bieber mania I guess.
