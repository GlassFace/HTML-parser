 Ones that come to mind immediately are both Fairy Tail and Sword Art Online.

 Death Note after a key plot twist for sure. Darker Than Black and Angel Beats as well. Although, I never did finish Angel Beats... 
 1987-2002 is my 'golden age' myself.

Dude, I wish. Every time I bring up the idea; with friends, or online... people... have... to... disagree. 
 Definitely Elfin Lied, it's on my list of considerable watches.. however thats only because its one of the first anime i watched when i first started to really get into it. I heard of it from friends and ended up borrowing it to see what all the hype was about.. To my surprise, half naked pre-teens with abnormal abilities..... seems really good, but its just weird, however, after watching it again a few years later i was still just as baffled by what the creator was thinking when he wrote this that i decided that it was worth of my list, simply on the basis of mind-****-confusion. Similar to the ending episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion which is one of my favorite anime after watching it 7x in an attempt to understand it. (thank god for the remake movies 1.11,2.22,3.33,&4.44). 
Anime worthy of mention: Elfen lied, Blue Drop, Burst Angel, Bleach, (Eureka seven), Cowboy Bebop, Steins;Gate, Beyond the boundary, Magi - The Kingdom of Magic, Heroic-Age, (Neongenises Evangelion +1.11,2.22,3.33, &4.44), Gunslinger Girls, Attack on Titan, ef - a tale of melodies, Air, Five Centimeters Per Second, Noein, Simoun, Rahxephon, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Chrome shelled regios, Rurouni Kenshin + movies, Overman King Gainer, Gurren-lagann, Shounen Onmyouji, PlanetES, Eden of The East, Final Fantasy VII, Voices of a Distant Star, The Sky Crawlers, jyu-oh-sei, Princess Mononoke, xam'd: Lost Memories, Time of Eve, The garden of words, Log Horizon, Tokyo Ravens 
 The ending of Blood+ had me disappointed. Just an opinion >.>
