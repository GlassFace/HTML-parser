[OOC] A Tale of Heroes
 | The Legend | ~Thousands of Years Ago~ *Not required to completely understand this Legend  Spoiler Man has forever sought to seek more power. Since the beginning of mankind, there are those who follow, and those who lead. There was once a King named Arzun. His majesty ruled with an iron fist, separating society into an upper, middle and lower class. Increasing taxes, slavery of the poor, were just some of the methods he used to increase his power in the world. Limiting the teaching of magic to only those who could afford it, Arzun was able to create the country to his liking. “Your highness, does nothing satisfy you? Even Royals in other countries envy you.” A man asked. Arzun did not understand the meaning of the question. If there was still more power to be sought, then why would he not try to obtain it? “Tell me…if we were at war, then would other countries hesitate to attack?” The King asked the man. The man didn’t reply. “Of course not. They don’t fear us. At least not yet.” The King said. With that in mind, the King had an idea. What he needed was something to show that they were not to be messed with. Stricter laws would indeed enforce his power over the people, but that didn’t help him with facing other countries. “What do we need to be feared?” The man asked curiously. The King looked at the man, and gave a malicious smile. The King’s intentions were to keep a weapon, capable of destroying entire armies. “We need a Dragon.” Yes, the King’s idea was to capture the very essence of fear itself within nature. The man was shocked. Dragons were the rarest of beasts. Many people spend their entire lives without ever finding the elusive creature, let alone capture it. “We leave tonight.” With that said, the King and his finest men packed their bags and headed to the wilderness. ~ After a month of travelling, the grueling sun was beating down on the men and their bodies were taking a toll. Out of the fifty, twenty men were gone. Some done in by wild animals, others suffering from natural causes. “Your highness…we need to go back. The more we stay out, the more men we will lose.” The man said, throat dry. The King hesitated, looking in front of them. “This is it. It has to be. The Dragon’s Nest”. The men stared into a pit filled with webs and the stench of rotting flesh. Carcasses were scattered about, torn limb by limb. Without word, the men climbed down the pit, eventually retreating from the surface of the upper world down to the foreign cave. “We’re almost there.” The men reached the bottom of the pit, with a loud growl rushing through the caverns bringing along a lingering odor. “I think…that’s the-“ The man was cut off, as a loud screech hissed through the cave, enough to make a man’s ear bleed. They were soon faced with a pair of red eyes, glowing within the darkness of the caverns. ~ After the conquering of Dragons, it brought forth the age of Valkyries. Many dragons were ruled and used as weapons during wars, and people who gained control over these creatures attained the power of ‘Valkyries’. Enhanced strength, limited flight, were able to create soldiers capable of taking out multiple enemies at once. However, as the years progressed, there disputes among the regular humans and Valkyries, in which the latter should be superior to the former. This eventually led to a war lasting for years, and ultimately resulting in the wipeout of the dragons and Valkyries, rendering them non-existent. This legend has become a thing of the past now, being merely stories for the people. | Current Events | Location: Continent of Aras | Country: Salos The World has entered the Third Era. Currently in the midst of a Civil War between the regions of Kale and Grandora, Salos is not exactly the most stable country. Diaz, the King of Grandora has begun his reign of terror on the country. In an effort to attain more power, he has taken control of Kale’s regions to create his own empire, creating his new title of Emperor Diaz. His actions have caused many rebellion groups to arise within the nation, trying to put an end to his takeovers. The aftermath of many battles have left places desolated, slums even. Although there are still many ‘neutral zones’, or rather places that have not been affected by the war, travellers should be weary of venturing into dangerous territory. Along with the creation of rebellion groups, several industries have been booming. The mining industry has brought in money for thousands of businessman, with people looking for jobs after losing their previous ones. Farms have been doing slightly more poor in the country ever since the start of the war, with less crops being available with each passing year the war goes on. However, a lot of criminal and gang activity has been reported around the country, filled with people who instead of working, steal, kill and do other criminal activities for money. Diaz however, is one step ahead of them. One of Diaz’s most famous plans, is implementing the Galvez Prison facility for both criminals, rebellion groups, and those who oppose Diaz’s ideals. The prison is a hell-on earth located in the mountains North-West of Kale. Although nobody is sure what goes on in there, it’s evident the prisoners are somehow dealt with, seeing as how nobody has ever come out. Under constant watch, nobody can get in either without permission or approval of access. Now only time can tell how this war will be played out, and how it ends. | The RP | Okay guys, that was essentially the introduction. Sorry for so much text, but it doesn’t end there! I still need to explain the world of the RP, and how this will be played out. If you like RPGs and JRPGs, then please, read on! The RP Itself: This RP is going to be a nice, long RP, with lots of interactions. In fact, I will have to split it up into multiple parts, because the storyline is going to change suddenly, and the because there will be so much going on. Part one is going to be called: Reign of Diaz. Don’t worry, the first part itself will be as long as a regular RP (hopefully it will last that long, trust me it gets tense near the end). This is not sandbox, although there will be many times where you will be able to wander around a town and whatnot, hang out with other characters, eat, etc. For the majority of the RP, we will be travelling as a group. Also, a little side note. If you want to create a side arc let me know and we'll sort something out. The Setting & Your Character: First off, this is an original RP, which means it’s not an existing franchise. The time period is not exact (there will be times when it will be slightly more ooutdated/rustic, and times when it will be slightly more modern.), but I guess the closest I can say would be Skyrim-esque, maybe even SAO-esque as well(or some other fantasy-style RPG/JRPG if you can think of one), but slightly more ‘updated’. For example, some guns are allowed as weapons in this RP, as long as they make sense, and it isn’t a machine gun or something (make sure you go by me first before making a gun, this is an absolute MUST). Swords and bows and whatnot are okay as well. World-wise, there’s no map yet of the country, mainly because I will be creating things along the way (although some places are already determined), plus I want other players to be able to make their own side-stories and cities/towns if they want to. At the start of the RP, the characters will currently be en-route to Galvez Prison for whatever reason that may be. You don’t have to explain this in your character history, but you can if you wish. It will be there that we all meet and greet and find a way out of the prison. The story builds onwards from there, and falls a lot on the shoulders of the characters. Your character should be affected by the war somehow (doesn't have to that major). They shouldn't be too experienced with fighting or using magic, as there is plenty of time to do that throughout the RP. Note: If you are wondering what the legend has to do with the RP, it is there because there will be several references to it throughout the RP, and plays a huge role later on. Your character doesn't have to be familiar with the legend at all. Elements: There are seven elements in total. Elements are essentially the type of an individual’s attacks and magic. Everyone has an element, although not all can use magic(your characters will be able to use magic). Magic of someone’s own element will be stronger. However, some of your other magic of a different element may be weaker and harder to learn. Essentially magic of your element is easier to learn, and magic of resisting element is harder. Here are the elements: Fire: Is good against Lightning/ Weak against Water Water: Is good against Fire/Weak against Lightning Wind: Is good against Earth/ Weak against Earth Earth: Is good against Wind/Weak against Wind Lightning: Is good against Water/Weak against Fire Light: is good against Dark/Weak against Dark Dark: Is good against Light/Weak against Light Magic: What’s an RPG without magic? Magic has many uses rather than just attacking. The amount of magic spells created is nearly limitless. Magic can be learned by either practicing, learned from others, or created by one’s self through extensive research and trial and error. They can range from simple attacks, healing spells, shields, etc. Mana is the energy needed to perform Magic. The amount of Mana depends on the person. Some people naturally have larger reserves of Mana, and others do not. The main way of increasing Mana is through training, frequency of usage, and the most common way is just by waiting, as time naturally lets your body increase reserves of mana. There are also items that may increase mana reserves or regeneration. Note: Any sort of magic regarding the usage of bringing back the dead is off limits. Healing magic is mainly going to be within the elements of Water or Light, but if you can provide a good reason for it being of a different element go ahead. NPCs  Spoiler Diaz: The main Antagonist for the first part of the RP. Currently titled 'Emperor', he is in total control of Western Salos. In his palace in Grandora, he can control the war from his throne, preferring not to get his hands dirty himself. May be seen as a coward to most people. He is carrying through his father's legacy, who died a few years ago and took his place. Kazul: Controls most of Eastern Salos, and currently resides in the City of Kale. Titled 'King', Kazul doesn't interfere much with Diaz. For reasons unknown, he does not try to stop Diaz, but instead minds his own business with the Eastern side of the country. Age 24, and like Diaz he also took his father's throne after he died a year before Diaz's father. Blonde hair, good looking, blue eyes, this King as it all, plus his way with the ladies. Luna: At twenty-one years old, she's the younger sister of Kazul. Also good looking with Blonde hair, the two share similar physical traits. She doesn't talk much with her brother, nor does she care much for political affairs. However, she does have a heart of gold, and is caring for others and willing to help anyone in need. Rules: 1) All forum rules apply 2) No bunnying/God-modding. Please, just don't do it. If you don't know what that means let me know. 3) Please post as frequently as you can. This is one of those RPs that is fun if you keep up. 4) If you plan being away for a while, please let me know ahead of time. I cannot stress this enough. 5) Swearing is allowed since this is rated 'M'. Please don't abuse this. 6) Romance/Sexual stuff I have no problems with, as long as you are not too explicit. Make sure you're not writing a new fifty shades of grey. 7) Seeing as how this is a little more mature, expect blood. It probably won't be to the extent of horror movies or anything, but expect violence. 8 )Please be realistic when there is fighting. I know there's magic and whatnot, so that doesn't really apply, but if your character gets punched in the face, act like they actually did get punched rather than take it like it was nothing. Sign-Up Sheet:  Spoiler Name: (Appropriate name please) Age: (19+) Gender: Element: (Pick one of the elements above as your character's natural affinity). Appearance: (A good description or pic of the character. Make sure they're human. No orcs or elves of the sorts or making up your own race. Not trying to be racist, but it's just a rule I have. Also, no pre-existing characters such as movie, TV or anime characters, must be original.) Personality: (Their personality? How do they act? Do they get along well with others? Try to be descriptive please.) Hometown: (Where are they from? Make up a place, and give a location. Make sure it is not in another country, unless they moved here.) History: (A history of your character. What do they do, are they wealthy, did the war affect them in any way, where are they from. Feel free to make up towns/cities for them. We may even be able to visit them during the RP.) Weapon: (What weapon do they have? You can be creative, but don't go too overboard for now. No oversized swords or anything. If they use gun(s), make sure it fits with the character (a regular person probably wouldn't have a gun as a weapon), and make it suitable for the RP. No machine guns, bazookas, etc. Guns that use mana as bullets also exist.) Magic: (Their current list of magic + element of each spell. Only a maximum of three, and please remember that your characters should inexperienced with using magic so don't overdo it. There will be plenty of time for improvement throughout the RP. Also, remember to include magic of your own element. It is not possible for someone to know magic of all elements.) Other: (Anything else we should know about?) My Sign-Up:  Spoiler Name: Artus Callum Age: 20 Gender: Male Appearance: He is a young man, standing approximately 6'3", and weighing in at about 225lbs. He is pretty solid in terms of build, from working a labor job for quite a while with his father giving him a solid amount of muscle. A little more bulky than lean, he by no means have a body of a model. He has light brown-ish skin complexion, with short black hair. His skin is free from any imperfections such as acne or scars, as he takes fairly good care of it. Most of the time his beard is shaven, but after a week of no shaving, he tends to get a bit of stubble, and even longer will result in a scruffy or rugged look. His eyes are dark brown, almost black if not seen from up close. He doesn't wear any armor, as he likes to move freely without the extra weight. Instead, he just wears a fitted, pale black short-sleeved tunic. For pants, he wears light brown pants, made out of a tough denim-like material. For shoes, he wears simple black boots that were just hand -me-downs. Finishing off his look is a light brown belt that slings around the front of his body to carry his sword around. Personality: Artus the type of guy you would want having your back. He’s a loyal friend, and never turns his back away from his peers. Although this could be argued against when he was younger, now that he's older he is more capable of following a leader-type role rather than a bully. He can get timid at times, however this usually occurs when he is embarrassed about something such personal issues, relationship, etc. But he doesn't get embarrassed too easily, as is pretty open about most things, and will most likely answer any question thrown his way. He is also on the more competitive side. He loves friendly competition, and occasionally gambles for money, items, and other minor things. However, his gambling sometimes goes too far. Although he is no an addict, he does have a tendency to gamble whenever he has the chance. He also shows a violent side of himself when he gets mad. Not temper problems exactly, but when it comes to direct fist fighting, he is known to throw some hard punches, and go all out. Almost all the time he would rather fight with his fists than his sword, as he likes the feel of a punch landing a direct hit. History: His hometown was invaded by Diaz’s forces, after one of Diaz’s commanders, known as Commander Ghan, decided to get hostile by taking over the towns that surrounded Grandora. This completely blindsided the town, leaving many people homeless, and left some killed. Sadly, to Artus' knowledge, his family didn't make it through the attack, but he however was able to escape for a while. He has relatives that live in a another city, which is doing fine as of now. Their city has remained neutral, and seems like it will stay out of the way of conflict. Due to personal issues with his other family, Artus' original intent was to go live with them. His relatives are more on the wealthier side, but his uncle and cousin are greedy gluttons which is one of the reasons Artus doesn't want to see them. Being a commoner, finding a job was hard. His parents weren't rich, nor did they have any sort job that payed exceptionally well. Labor jobs were all taken, and he didn't have any education or knowledge on how to run a business, so opening up a booth at a marketplace was out of the question, so was running a shop. Hometown: Nalan – Located south of Grandora, and one of the first places to be invaded by Diaz and his forces. Although not occupied by them, currently it resides as a sort of refugee camp, with minimal shelter. Weapon: A regular sword, made of steel. Element: Lightning Magic Spells: ThunderBolt: Artus shoots a bolt of electricity at his opponent(s). Barrier: This particular spell is Light Elemented. Artus creates shield formed out of Mana. The shield does not cover 360 degrees, but rather only one side at a time. Electric Blade: Artus fills his sword with Lightning elemented magic energy, increasing damage potential. Other: N/A Accepted List:  Spoiler 1) Artus Callum [Jegretis] 2) ~Reserved by Yuuchun~ 3) Aislenn De'Sparrow [Rabbit-Chan] 4) Dezarae Torres [イサーク]

 Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide. *Bill The Butcher - Gangs Of New York* 
 @Rabbit-Chan: You are accepted. Once a few more people sign-up we shall start and I'll post the IC thread. 
 Yes! I'm so excited to start this

 Name: Dezarae Torres Age: 19 Gender: Male Element: Fire Appearance: Tall and slim in build. Skin tone looks a modest pale and a little griff. His black hair is of medium length and unkempt. He keeps his face clean shaven and upon closer inspection, Dez has several tiny faint scars on his face. The most noticeable, a slight cut on his left cheek. The orange pigmentation of his eyes are however the most unusual considering he's of orient decent. Attire consist's of a well-worn dark brown leather vest. Underneath this, he wears a lightly studded cotton collared shirt, where the sleeves are folded to the elbows. Long trousers buckled at the bottom to traveled brown boots. Appears to have a tattoo which can be seen on his left forearm - a red dragon. Personality: Somewhat empathetic, speaks whatever is on his mind, even when he knows it would not be wise to do so or that it would cause conflict. Nonetheless, he is an honest individual. Hometown: Russell History: Originally from Russell, a small mining town on the outskirts of Crimm city, located north-east of Grandora. Pretty much an uneventful life, Dez moved to Crimm city to become something more than just a miner. Took combat training at Diaz' military facility just to have food and shelter, and eventually schooled on neighboring lands aware of the propaganda they taught. For 2 years he trained but never joined the army due to his uneasiness to conform to such fascist principles; Not because he disagrees with it, but because he believes he'll live longer not being part of it. This however made Dez open to suspicion of being a traitor, and ultimately Dez was forced to flee back to Russell. Upon reaching Russell he met up with a wandering nomadic tribe of merchants, known for their lore of dragons, rare items and numerous manipulations of the elements. It is from them that Dez received a tattoo of a dragon to represent his affinity with fire. Dez learned many things from them, yet unfortunately it was the last time he would see them, as they would never return. On the orders from Diaz' governing body situated in Crimm city, the nomadic tribe were hunted down and destroyed. A few months later, Dez himself was arrested for an unrelated incident involving a governor's daughter. Weapon: None Magic: Fireball - Creates small fireballs, which are formed from his palms and can be thrown wildly in every direction.

 @イサーク: You are of course, accepted! One more, and we shall start. 
 Name: Seraphina Kollins (Sera) Age: 22 Gender: Female Appearance: Long pale blonde hair that she often throws back into a ponytail. Light green eyes in a slim face; she isn't beautiful but she is pretty. Skin slightly tanned and clear, with a thin, inch long scar over her left eyebrow from an accident with a plow. Sera is about 5'9" with slim but broad shoulders. Her body build is one of an athletic person; slim but built with lean muscles from working on a farm most of her life. Usually wears a short sleeved white tunic with a brown vest made out of a leather like material, dark brown pants made with denim like material, a black belt that holds 2 sheaths, and black soft leather boots that are almost knee length. Carries various leather bags that hold her snare materials as well as her money(that one isn't visible) Personality: Sera is a easy going person who likes to laugh and listen to others around her. Very much a people person and enjoys conversing and action. Doesn't like to mull about and do nothing, and will be constantly in some form of motion-from tapping her foot or fingers, to rocking slightly back and forth. Curious and intelligent, she learns quickly. Loyal as hell, she will stand up in what she believes in as well as for the people she loves and cares for at any cost. You can tell her any type of secret, big or small, and Sera will never breathe a word of it to another person. Fascinated with history, myths and legends, she is very familiar with the Legend. She is stubborn and quick tempered, and will lash out with vicious words when seriously ticked off, but that's not very often. Sera won't haul off and hit a person when she is mad, but she will respond to violence with violence. Has very nimble fingers. Harbors something kindred to hate toward Diaz; blames him for the death of her dear father and little brother. History: She grew up on a farm of rather well standing and she is the oldest child of a family of five, including a mother and a father. As the oldest, she worked the farm with her father more often then any of the other children. The farm produced very well, and her family was well off money wise. Not wealthy, but on the lower side of middle class. While not particularly skilled in fighting, she is a skilled hunter, and her and her father would sell meat and skins to a nearby butcher and tanner, enabling her to have her own money saved up. Later on, the farm was raided by Diaz's soldiers for its food, then burned and destroyed. When the house was burned down, her father and youngest brother were still inside, killing both. Her mother and her remaining sister has traveled to Kashet, a small city that at this point is still neutral, and together they have started a seamstress shop. Seraphina was going from town to town, hunting whenever she could and selling hides and meats for money and food. As a daddy's girl, she never particularly got along well with her mother, though she loves her dearly. Avoids Diaz's soldiers as much as possible. Hometown: Lived south of Kashet which is located east of Grandora. Weapon(s): Two leather pommel steel daggers, and a bow(staff) Element: Fire Magic spells: Flare: (Fire) a small, bright flame that burns for a period of time to allow light at night or in caves. Flash Flame: (Fire) a sudden blast of fire that singes/seriously burns opponent(s) depending on its intensity and the power of the mana behind it. Nourish: (Earth) sends nourishing energies to plants to help them grow(something acquired from years of growing crops) 
 Awesome profiles yall Uh, just one thing, you'll probably hate me, but I'm going to be out of town for a few days, and being fully committed in the next days will be impossible. It's my fault for signing up, really. I can only suggest that this RP be started without me, or I come in later, or wait for a few more people to sign-up. 
 Yeah, I'm going to have the same problem. I won't be able to post at all over the weekend. Monday I should be able too though. 
 Name:화영 여우 (Hwayoung Yeou)Age:27Gender:FemaleElement:DarkAppearance:  Spoiler Personality:Hwayoung outwardly portrays herself as tall, graceful, and dignified, also exhibiting arrogance and vanity  a personality to match her high rank among fellow syndicate members. She also takes great pride in both her physical appearance and abilities; her narcissism sometimes puts her at a disadvantage as she refuses to unleash her full might until late in a mission. But perhaps her greatest asset is that all of her de facto history, philosophy and social network are shrouded in mystery  something that Hwayoung is very well aware of and willing to use it to her advantage. However Hwayoung's inner personality is paradoxically structured by ideals of chivalry; although she is not unwilling to deceive allies and use unorthodox methods in order to achieve goals that she deems beneficial to all.Hometown:Cintamani  a secretive and rather elusive city located in the fog shrouded forest south of the Galvez Prison. Cintamani is also ironically known as the Thieves' Den.History:Hwayoung's de facto history, philosophy and social network are shrouded in mystery with a few highlighted exceptions. The first known fact of Hwayoung's history is that she swindled an MLM company into bankruptcy and rumor was that it was for revenge although the cause for the revenge is unknown. As a result, she spent 3 years in prison, giving her the nickname "Ex-Con" among syndicate members. The second and last known fact about Hwayoung is that she's a three time winner of Cintamani's Liar Game tournament; a tournament that is said to select Cintamani's new citizens and losers of the tournament are either sent to Galvez Prison or are given enormous amount of debt.Weapon:Three mythical stones: Susanoo, Chang'e and Daesoon.Magic:Susanoo [Water]: will grant the ability to control water in any shape or form she wishes accordingly to her mana reserves.Chang'e [Dark]: grants the ability of light hypnosis and illusions for example create ghost-like objects or induce sleeping on an opponent. Daesoon [Fire]: grants the ability of molecular acceleration meaning it can set anything ablaze, even if they are non flammable, and incorporeal matter such as the air itself.Other:

They had taught Ren how to fight in case of an invasion by Diaz so he can survive the war. He had his parents and younger brother to look after. Life was fine for Ren, he had friends that when they grew up they would join the Kale army to protect their loved ones. The day when Diaz’s army came to invade, Ren and family were captured by the army. The Kale army was too late to come a save the hostages but they were able to defend Kyria. While imprisoned, the Diaz army tried to train Ren in become a soldier for Diaz’s army. One night, Ren was planning on escaping and he overheard the screams of his parents. He found his parents right when they were being executed. He saw both of his parents killed in front of him. Commander Zeghar had seen him and attacked Ren. His sword cut Ren’s face leaving a scar that would let out burning anger and darkness. Ren fought back and ran. His brother was nowhere to be seen in the prison and Ren ended up having to leave his brother thinking he had been killed as well. He escaped Grandora and had nowhere else to go. He was left to survive in the world alone and a memory of him was left in Grandora. Hometown: Kyria – Located in Eastern Salos. A small bustling city, which was quite modern and old fashioned at the same time. It is near the ocean so in the spring and summer it can be quite warm.

 Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide. *Bill The Butcher - Gangs Of New York* 
 Name: Raelynn Arquise; prefers to be called Rae Age: 24 Gender: Female Element: Lightning Appearance: Standing a modest 5'7”, Raelynn's 124 lb. frame is trim and well toned. Being a champion caliber gymnast, she's lithe and extremely agile.Her wiry athletic frame hides deceptive strength and endurance. Her honey-hued eyes are alluring and have bewitched many. She has an odd sort of vanity when it comes to her waist length silky auburn locks,and she loves showing of her naturally tanned olive skin. Outside of the uniforms required for her training, she enjoys wearing anything purple her tastes lying in fashionably short skirts and sinfully sexy blouses. She also never goes anywhere without the pair of forearm bracers that are a family heirloom. She is not found of heels as she dislikes the distortion to her sense of balance. Personality: Raelynn is extremely confident, which has often gotten her into a few altercations with other women. Not hot-headed by any means, she refuses to take any sort of slight to herself or anyone she calls a friend or family. The only time she ever truly loses her temper however, is when someone badmouths her sexuality or the sexuality of others. She's been out and proud since her 16th birthday, and detests homophobic slurs. She's a born competitor and loves any sort of friendly competition. She's turned many things into a competition or made simple games into tournaments. She loathes losing an argument, but never holds a grudge. Raelynn's loyal to a fault, and would never hesitate to help a friend in need. Whenever someone's in any kind of danger, she's the first to jump in and help them out. Hometown: Raelynn was born in Kroque, a small city in southern Salos. She spent her first thirteen years in the rural city, but moved to Kyria when her father was hired as an engineer. History: Raelynn spent her childhood, having no idea what she wanted to become. Once she moved to Kyria, that all changed. She met the woman whom inspired her to become a gymnast of four months after her move. She trained with one of Salos' most famed gymnasts, quickly gaining fame of her own. Shortly before her 15th birthday, she met the person that would alter her life forever; her first girlfriend. She had known that she was not interested in boys for a while, but never understood why, until she saw this girl.Sadly, a few months after they started dating, they were attacked bya group reputed for vicious hate crimes against homosexuals. Raelynn's first lover was killed, and she was left hospitalized for months after being beaten brutally. After recovering, rehab was torturous, and no one thought she'd be able to return to her gymnastics, but she did. After coming out to her family and coach once her rehab was completed on her 16thbirthday, Raelynn began training under one of the most reclusive Kempo and Kendo dojos she could find, also discovering a latent talent for Lightning and Water magics. Shortly after her 23rd birthday, she earned the ranking of 1st Dan. Weapons: A pair of katana forged by her grandfather. They have interlocking guards which allows them to become a single, double-bladed sword. Magic: ThunderBlade – Channeling her lightning magic into the blades of her katana, she creates a pressure wave whenever the blades cut through the air. AquaDome – A defensive spell which creates a dome of water around a target within a 9 yard radius of the caster. StunningStrike – Raelynn strikes an opponent with electrically charged fists, causing them to be paralysis for a short period of time. -------------------------------------------------------- I'll do my best to reply often, I really missed RPing.

 Before Creation, There Must be Destruction. 
 Here it is. If there are any problems just tell me. Be blunt. CS Name: Kaze Dorobō Age: 24 Gender: Male Element: Wind Appearance: Ok, so Kaze is pale. He is about 6’2” in height and with a minimal amount of muscle (yes this guy is skinny), he has straight, silver hair that at the back reaches to his neck. He has different coloured eyes, one being green and the other being blue. Kaze’s nose is long and thin and his lips are thin and pale. He tends to wear three quarter pants and an open cloth vest. Under the vest you can see just how skinny he is as you can see his ribcage against his skin. His pants have back pockets, thigh pockets, and the normal pockets. He does not have much body hair at all. Personality: Kaze is mainly a kind and cheery person, always gives people a fair go. He has a certain kind of humor and way of speech that just tends to get most people to like him, this helps in his lifestyle and career. Most of the time Kaze is a friendly, talkative young man but when he decides he has to he will block out the entire world, move around without voice and without much emotion. But otherwise that pretty much summed it all up, Kaze is a happy sort of man that pretty much likes to have fun most of the time. Hometown: Kaze hails from one of the ‘greatest’ places in all of Aras, the lower-class outskirts of Cale, known as Dexton by the locals. It isn’t a pretty place for certain, but with such high theft and murder rate, everybody knows everybody and whoever doesn’t know someone else is usually an outsider. Kaze lives in the northern area of the outskirts, it is densely populated and the buildings are taller than the other areas. Past the northern outskirts there are mountains, which then to the west of those mountains you will find the all feared Galvez Prison. History: (A history of your character. What do they do, are they wealthy, did the war affect them in any way, where are they from. Feel free to make up towns/cities for them. We may even be able to visit them during the RP.) Kaze was originally born in Cale itself. But when Diaz invaded Cale and its surrounding regions, Kaze’s parents were killed, being at a young age, at nine years old at this time, Kaze fled the scene and ran away. There was terror for him. He ran north to the outskirts where he hid out and eventually stayed and grew to live at. Being an outsider in Dexton, Kaze’s new life started off quite difficult. He had to fend for himself and he had to learn to steal and fight. Life became a competition, many other children died from starvation or from being killed by starving people, young or old it doesn’t matter if your starving and killing another is going to save you for another day or two. Some people formed sorts of ganglike groups (lets just call them gangs), these gangs tend to have a family like bond and look out for eachother. Whether it is in a fight or just to get in the road if one from your team is running from a failed theft attempt. Kaze joined one of these gangs as he saw it to be necessary if he were to maximize his chances of surivival. Kaze was about a year later than the rest of his gang when he discovered his natural affinity, so at the age of 17 Kaze was gifted with the power of wind. Now these gangs that I was talking about, it is quite common for these gangs to have feuds and grudges. When Kaze was 20 his group was massacred. He had been out doing his usual routine of stealing bits and pieces and talking to certain friendly shopkeepers that might give away a stale loaf of bread or maybe some bruised apples. When Kaze returned home he found the aftermath of the massacre. Bloody corpses were everywhere, bludgeoned to death with rocks or cut up and stabbed with knives and shivs. He wanted to know who did this, but from the look of the scene Kaze knew he wouldn’t be able to do anything. So he moved on. From there on Kaze took on jobs, whether they are theft, stalking, murder. Anything as long as it pays. Kaze was naturally quieter on his feet and due to his affinity he had an increase in his movement speed and jump height. These factors came in handy for his jobs, for now that he no longer had a gang to rely on he had to fend for himself. Death was not an option so he had no choice but to live. A few weeks after his 24th birthday, Kaze was offered a big job. It was an assassination on the head of another gang. He was offered a 10 gold coins if he was to kill the target and 15 gold coins if he does it without being caught out. On the night of the assassination was the night that Kaze finally got caught. The plan started off without a hitch. Two nights later he went to the roof of the building next door to where the gang stays, Got a good run up and jumped the gap, landing in a quiet roll. Wind came in handy here as it quietened and softened the landing. Well he knocked out the guard on the roof through using a sleeper hold (for those that don’t know the sleeper hold it is a type of headlock that cuts off breath and puts strain on the blood flow). This allowed him a minute to breathe and figure out his strategy, he decided that he would try to sneak into the bed chambers as at this time of night, other than the guards most people tend to be asleep. So he snuck through to the bed chambers, where he found the target. Kaze always found that when his targets are asleep he almost pities them. To sleep without the knowledge that you won’t wake up again… It was a terrible thing. The target was sleeping with his back up, this made it far easier. Kaze brought out his shiv and put it between the fourth and fifth rib, he pushed and the shiv pierced straight and cleanly through flesh and that was the end for this target. The moment that Kaze slipped out the door from the bedroom he was confronted by three men, two with swords drawn and one holding a piece of paper to Kaze’s face. This was useless as Kaze didn’t know how to read. But he knew what it was. It was a warrant for murder. Naturally enough, Kaze smiled a grim smile. But then he lashed out, grabbing the swordsman to his right by the wrist and twisting him around in a manner that Kaze was behind him, sword in hand and to the swordsman’s throat. Although the moment Kaze was out of the building he realized that he would not escape today. More men were there, although they backed up at the sight of the hostage. There was a guard with a bow, 50 yards out. He let an arrow loose that grazed Kaze across the left calf. With a cry of pain Kaze unintentionally let go of his hostage, this in turn allowed the guards to get to Kaze. He was captured. Several days later in the local prison with some old colleagues, Kaze was informed that he was being moved to Galvez Prison in two days. They started the trip two days later in the night, due for Galvez in the afternoon. (This is where the post will start). Weapon: Ok, so Kaze tends to improvise, if there is something that can be used as a weapon then cool! If not then ok, his hand to hand will have to do. He has a slight idea on how to use a sword but he does not use them (it would be too hard to conceal a sword in is clothes). Usually he keeps a shiv on hand in case things get bloody or he needs to kill someone quick and quiet. Magic: Ok, so Kaze doesn’t know spells, his affinity of wind just adds on to his natural attribute (being speed, sound, movement, and his senses). That’s about it for him at the moment. Other: Not much else to really tell after 968 words about his life. Let’s just have fun ok?
