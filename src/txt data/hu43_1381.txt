 Pokemon X and Y - Page 8

All things considered, it's not a long journey to get back to it, compared to lugia/Ho-oh or dialga, palkia, giratina. Damn. I'll have to try that if I restart the game. I was under the impression I had to do it right there >.> Has anyone tried the Friend Safari yet? It's a pretty neat feature. Anyone on your 3DS friend list has their own mini Safari Zone, and each person has their own type. i.e one of my friends' safaris only has electric types, while another only has flying. It's useful for getting some rarer pokes. I got Electabuzz and Emolga from the electric one. 
 Seems the save bug was finally acknowledged by Nintendo. They said a fix will be available on the Nintendo eShop soon! http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-new...xy-save-glitch Good to know that Nintendo can fix this completely! Now I can get started playing again and not worry! \^_^/ 
 Hopefully it'll be solved by the time I get my own copy of Pokémon. That being said, I'm torn between selecting Fennekin and Froakie as my starter. Can anyone give me some recommendations?

 Well, as long as you don't save in Lumiose City, you're fine. If needs be you could just close the clamshell, which puts it into sleep mode. That's usually what I do, because saving annoys me. I like Froakie. I got one in the endgame and once I level it up some more, it'll most likely take Blastoise's place in my team comp. Though ideally I'd be able to get one with the Protean ability. Maybe I'll try breeding for it. I did some Wonder Trading a couple days ago, and it paid off big-time. A Bulbasaur, level 1, with Giga Drain. Muahaha. 
 I kind of hate regular trading. Because unless you have direct access to talk with someone there is no way to know if the person you are trading with likes or hates what you are offering. Also there is no indication that your partner chose to trade, or wants to leave.

 Wow, they can update your cartridge? That's awesome.

 I think it's more along the lines of a patch, akin to the ones you get on PS3/360/PC.

 Hey, so do you guys want to exchange Friend Codes for the Friend Safari? The more the merrier! Mine's 3480-2614-6380 
 ~eSo7eRiC~ STATS  Spoiler 
 Sure thing. Mine is 0001-4330-4794. 
 I added you two, Kuroki and Denver. Mine is 5386-8004-7881. My safari is dragon type btw c: 
 Thanks for the Onix and Fraxure you two! It seems like the Friend Safaris come in sets; I added someone else with a Dwebble and Onix like Kuroki and another friend of mine gives Krabby and Quagsire like I do. But apparently the 3rd's randomized seeing as that friend gives Frogadiers and I give Azumarills... 
 ~eSo7eRiC~ STATS  Spoiler 
 Someone with Y give me Aggronite pls. Gotta have Mega Tyranitar and Mega Aggron because rawr I'm willing to trade a bibarel or zigzagoon for it. Possibly something else. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

 Well, I got X and chose Froakie as my starter. Currently trying to make my team Lv.10 before I challenge first gym (Vivilon kicked my a** with that damn Infestation attack). Froakie, Pikachu, and Beedrill are my Lv. 10's. Reason I'm still so early is because my roommate is letting me borrow his 3DS after he gets back from work, but only until the battery runs out so I can only play for just over 3 hours until I get my own 2DS next week.

 Hey guys, the lumiose glitch path is up. It should fix games that experience the glitch and prevent others from having it.

 I'm sad that I don't have this game... I like the idea of the friend safaris. My brother has it, but I'm not gonna play his game >.> screw that. Does anyone know if http://www.serebii.net/attackdex-xy/aromaticmist.shtml Is for duo battle only? Because if that is a permanent +1 SPD to all ally pokemon, that is OP... and if you get -SPD by opponent, you can swap out and you'd have your +SPD back ... Anyone know how it works? If I did have the game... I'd make my party: Xerneas, Gardevoir, Aromatisse, Azumarill, Sylveon... and apparently there's a dragon/fairy pokemon? Also, why isn't Blissey a fairy? My favourite wall...

IN a double or triple battle, when that move is used all ally pokemon's special def is raised by one stage. It's not a weather effect. So if someone's spc def is lowered, then the move will have to be used again to raise it. There is no dragon fairy type. Also your team, very bad. Very weak to steel and poison. My Aegislash can demolish you.

My Aegislash can demolish you. It wouldn't be for competitive obviously, It would be for ingame, since you can beat the whole game with really any party. I just like fairies :3 Light would have been cooler though

 Planning on having my non-legendary team as: Garchomp Absol (my favorite Pokémon btw) Greninja Aggron Tyranitar Charizard Dragon, Steel, and Dark are my favorite types. I would also not mind switching some of them with Chandelure, Gyarados, Haxorus, or Gallade.
