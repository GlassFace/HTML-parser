[Anime] The Marathon Curse
 So I find that whenever I start a new anime I fall victim to what I call the marathon curse. For whatever reason if I really like the anime I marathon right through it. It's actually pretty hard for me not to marathon an anime for a couple reasons. One of which is because I have way to much free time to handle. Every now and then I have stretched out a show where I didn't marathon right through, but that rarely happens. I guess I just have really been enjoying what I watch. My only problem though is I go through them too quick and I feel like I'm losing part of the experience like I don't get to fully enjoy it. Now here's a few questions for everyone... 1. If ever, how often do you marathon an anime? 2. Do you feel like you lose out on some of the experience by doing so? 3. What is the longest marathon you ever been on? (sadly mine was 10 hours straight when I watched Rurouni Kenshin 2 years ago) 4. Do you prefer to marathon or take your time? 
 1. I used to all the time, and they always made me cry when I did, I don't think I do well with emotions after staying up that long 2. Not really, feel way more involved in the stroy when I watch it all at once than an episode here and there 3. If you mean straight than probably around 10 hours when I was marathoning shana a season a day, if not in one sitting than still shana but over 3 days 4. Now I prefer to take my time cause I just don't have the attention span to watch them that long, though I'd love to get back into marathoning 
 1. I don't marathon much because I want to do other things. I only marathoned with AoT 2. Not really 3. 3 1/2 hours with AoT. 4. Prefer to take my time because as I said I want to do other things instead spend the whole day watching anime.

 1. If ever, how often do you marathon an anime? Rarely and only to the ones i own 2. Do you feel like you lose out on some of the experience by doing so? No 3. What is the longest marathon you ever been on? 22 episodes of supernatural 4. Do you prefer to marathon or take your time? it depends on how much I'm in to the show

I wouldn't call it a Curse, as that's the best possible way to watch anime, you'll lose out a bit, by not doing so(especially with epic, story driven anime). Whenever possible, the only times I don't marathon anime, is if I'm watching a brand new anime, that just came out in Japan. The first thing I wrote answers that. Somewhere around 72h If It's a great anime, and is story driven, I rather marathon it. If there is no/very little continuity with the ep for an anime anyway(aka Isn't story based), then I'll take my time. However I absolutely loath being a slave to ongoing anime's schedule(that's way to long a wait between ep), so I "try" to wait until a series/season ends. 
 While I don't really marathon, I often do put it on a priority. Depends on how much times I have to waste in a stretch. I can often spend an hour or two at a time on a series I'm enjoying. Spice and wolf took me about a week to watch. 
 1.most of the animes I have watched I marathond (the ones I didnt were the ones I found to be not as good) 2.no I actually feel like if I dont marathon it then it loses some of its meaning (small things that carry over from episode to episode u notice much more often) 3. no clue but honestly probably longer than anyone else here although depends what technically qualifies marathon but i would say for about 4-5 days straight I watched anime with short breaks here and there to eat and **** but yea 4. easily marathon (I am able to kinda dive deep into a show if a marathon, same happens with books) 
 It's something I think all or at least most younger anime fans do so I'm guessing you're younger. That's a personal opinion. I used to marathon almost any anime I watched it was my favorite thing to do. One time I sat up two days straight watching all 200 some episodes of Sailor Moon or maybe it was longer. When you have the luxury to waste time, and the new fresh prospective on anime why wouldn't you marathon it? I also agree that the best way to watch a series is straight through. When you watch a series here and there sometimes you can get lost or end up stalling the series all together to make room for new better ones. 1. If ever, how often do you marathon an anime? Rarely now but, if I really love a series sometimes I do like I recently did with Shingeki no Kyojin. 2. Do you feel like you lose out on some of the experience by doing so? No I feel like I know the series better because, there's no holes in my memory. 3. What is the longest marathon you ever been on? (sadly mine was 10 hours straight when I watched Rurouni Kenshin 2 years ago) Already answered that lol. 4. Do you prefer to marathon or take your time? I prefer to just watch whenever because, I'm lazy and rarely get sucked into a series these days.

 1. If ever, how often do you marathon an anime? Well since I have a lot of free time, I will do more marathons. Unless, I'm busy. 2. Do you feel like you lose out on some of the experience by doing so? No.. 3. What is the longest marathon you ever been on? Probably a hour or so. 4. Do you prefer to marathon or take your time? Either.

Do you prefer to marathon or take your time? 1.I don't marathon anime much. The ones I usually do are a bit stereotype and have a large number of episodes or I am totally addicted to it. 2. If I feel like I need to soak in each episode slowly I don't marathon. Hence I don't lose out much. Based on the gravity and nature of anime I tend to slow down a bit. 3. 11 hours straight watching Trinity Blood. 4. Since the series I deal with are often a bit complex I tend to take my time. 
 1. when I find a show I like I marathon it. 2. I feel you get a better experience when you marathon animes because all the details stay fresh in your head. 3. 8 hours- FMA: Brotherhood 4. marathon because that means I like the show so much that I cant stop watching

I pretty much have all the time in the world. As awesome as that is though it sucks at the same time. Iv'e been watching anime on and off for about 2 years now so as far as anime goes I consider myself to still be fairly new. I definitely agree with what everyone is saying though how it's better to marathon because everything stays fresh and it's more exciting and stuff. My only problem is when I marathon short shows like Angel Beats! or Deadman Wonderland which are roughly 12 episodes long. That's pretty much the only time that I feel like I'm missing out on something.

That's pretty much the only time that I feel like I'm missing out on something. Those series both ended on sort of a cut off spot. Not sure if there's going to be more Deadman Wonderland but, the manga is a lot longer. I wasn't impressed with the manga ending but, it was still a great read even though the end seemed to be just thrown together. As for Angel Beats there most def will not ever be another season and there we some questions left unanswered so maybe, you feel like you're missing something because, sometimes there IS something missing. Do you get what I mean? Sometimes I ramble sorry if I repeated myself at all.

 No not at all. What you said made perfect sense to me lol. I get what you mean though AB and DMW did seem a bit rushed to say the least. 
 1. If ever, how often do you marathon an anime? Normally i just marathon them 2. Do you feel like you lose out on some of the experience by doing so? No some times i dont rember all the charters names, but am bad with normal names in general so... 3. What is the longest marathon you ever been on? (sadly mine was 10 hours straight when I watched Rurouni Kenshin 2 years ago) i say probly first time watching code geass like 12 hours 4. Do you prefer to marathon or take your time? for short sweet animes that i hear are really good i like to marthon, then i may watch them again to try to rember names and some less remberable charters.
