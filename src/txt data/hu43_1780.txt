[In Review] Forum Rank Titles - Page 2
 What about a custom title exclusive for those who have contributed to the forums, 'CONTRIBUTOR' or something like that.? In my mind that would made them feel appreciated more. The only problem I see is determining the condition for earning that title.

Like Shian's current profile. As far as styling goes, Takeshi's looks nicer because it's clean. New forum ranks would need to be this size: Which is 190 x 14 px (three sided border is deliberate for stacking reasons) If people wanna make sets, that's cool but they need to be thin for the reasons I stated. We need to pretty much figure out what those ranks are going to be. It's been brought up many times, but I'm not sure if we settled on what we wanted (not talking graphically), or did we? As for KTs suggestion, I've seen other forums do it, but they seem to give titles to people based on their contribution to a particular forum like "gfxer, role player, writer, music guru" but they also appear to be given by admins or a mod who is a group leader (on non vB sites) The only way to do that is to put people into specific usergroups. It's not a bad idea though if we're trying to encourage better posting. You don't get it unless you make quality contributions to an area of the site. AND if they are stackable, they can earn more than one. well I got no problem putting a set together once the rank titles are decided on. but i cant start until i know what text to put in.

AND if they are stackable, they can earn more than one. I can try to work with that size given to me, but as far as old tags go some people still like the Otaku and Veteran tags so we can possibly incorporate those into the new rank titles and just upgrade them visually but as far as the other rank titles Newbie and Poser. I don't recall seeing anyone mentioning those, so maybe we can actually change them and add on after veteran.

In my mind that would made them feel appreciated more. The only problem I see is determining the condition for earning that title. This wouldn't be a problem, but the only way I can think of someone earning this title is if they have donated to the site when donating was still around. I'm not even sure if most of the people that did donate are even around anymore but I'll need someone else to clarify that for me, but nonetheless it sounds like a good idea. 
 What about something past veteran? And donations should come back.

Others seem to be interested in others titles as well though based on sections they're apart of, so we'll probably have to break it down into two different parts. One would be title's past veteran and the others will be titles given based on sections/what things you participate in frequently. 
 Uh, maybe not. The whole point of changing the ranking system is so that you have more tiers going up and new ranks. The current ones are there since the site began, so stopped at 500 posts. Should go something along this line: 0-19 20-49 50-99 100-249 250-499 500-999 1000-1999 2000-4999 5000-9999 10000 15000 20000 25000 (we will have a few retards there soon ) You have to start off with small steps and increase it as you go. @ Takeshi: We're not even sure that we can do that. (ranks for forums) What KT said was a suggestion that he'll have to bring up with Shian. My first hunch is that it's not something that can happen. It may end up being something that we, the staff, award to people. Don't jump the gun too far :P. Let's discuss what CAN be done, and the rest will come later. One thing at a time. Names for new ranks. I think people should post their suggestions on that. And we'll see who comes up with the best ones. I don't think they should be anime specific because we're not a fansite for any one anime. Titles like "weeaboo" are kinda horrible, to the person that said that. I think someone did come up with a pretty decent suggestion before. It may have been moved to the staff room, so will have to dig a little.

I remember having a thread posted about this awhile back when Shian wasn't around, and it didn't go anywhere but we did get some really good suggestions in there. I'll go searching for that thread and if I find it I'll post the suggestions people put in there in here.

If it means anything or makes this thread better suggestion wise here is a few suggestions you posted in the last discussion. Newbie: Starting rank. User: 100 posts and a member for something like 2-3 weeks. Abuser: 500 posts and a member for 2 months. Junkie: 1000 posts and a member for 4 months. Addict: 1,000 posts and a member for 6 months. Fiend: 2,000 posts and a member for 8 months. Burnout: 5,000 posts and a member for 1 year. Great Sage and Eminent Junkie (or something else, but I like the reference): 10,000 posts. Grand Poobah/Otaku(?): 15,000 posts. Legend/ary/Godlike/Mythical/Inhuman/Loser (one of 'em): 20,000 posts and no life. 
 Adding more ranks would spice things up, change it a little with the variation instead of having an army of veterans. 
 
 I like the idea of time requirements too. And newbie should stay, tis a good beginner rank. I remember when ai got poser i was like wdf is this...

 Well lets get some ideas posted people! Only the community can make this happen so we need more participation! @Shannon is there anyway you could possibly make this an announcement as well so we could get more participation? 
 Um, no, sorry. It's not a sure thing and we haven't spoken to the admin, so for now it's a suggestion.

When brilliance like that is forgotten, it really drives home just how ineffective these threads are.

 i knew this suggestion was older than Takeshi.

Time to bump that thread since it had a lot of great suggestions but these two were the best.

 I like Strugg's theme. I <3 Shian's theme, more socially acceptable too, but, the last one doesn't really fit. Shouldn't it be along the lines of Grandmaster, Sage, Legend, etc? 
 adding new ranks will encourage people to contribute to the site (by that I mean posting). That way the veterans can have a new goal. XD 
 Dubstep Chaos Theory - ShockOne l Siren - Kat Krazy ft Elkka l Faith - BlasterJaxx 
 Here's a few I came up with Rookie Hunter Kage Supreme Assassin Elite Guru Shichibukai Supernova 
 well since you really just want the same bars you have now just more of them an all people seem to be doing is talking ( which frankly is all most people do ) i made a quick set to get things rolling keep in mind these are not a final draft just an example to see if people like the titles tho i think they need to be thicker as they are so thin and many other forums use thicker user bars and they look 1000x better here is another set

 If there would be 2 requirement for the rank, time requirement amd post count requirement, would it be obtainable if the user meets both conditions or one of the conditions? @Zenex the second set sure looks better than the first, but somehow it looks a bit boring, maybe because the color. In my opinion, brighter colors and an abstract pattern would work better, but not like he first set since it looks too cluttered for me. Still, those looks pretty good nonetheless.

Just actually reread your question again because I answered it wrong the first time lol but yeah I do think you'd have to meet both requirements. Here are my examples, let me know if you like them.
