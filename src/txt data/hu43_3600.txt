 Sword Art Progressive (SAO Comedic Parody): Unique Skill that Saves the World
 Summarized in a few words: Overwhelmingly ridiculous comedic parody of Sword Art Online. Dark Knights even speak American Engrish! And the AI machine translates it too! And worst of all... yeah. I forgot the year SAO story started, so... Read Prologue Introduction, and decide if you want to. Something ridiculous... sometimes. Note that this is rawest version. Prologue Intro: The year is 20XX. There was once a young man, 22, who stayed home to enter another world. 10 years ago, he had discovered a "prototype" of a head gear he started using constantly. His mother would always complain “Take off that stupid head gear of yours! Why won’t you listen to me!?” He stayed at home, trying to be himself, but he is always interrupted. In fact, he had a forbidden Nerve Gear not associated with the outside public. A Nerve Gear that can cause a person to transform, a Nerve Gear associated with being “forbidden.” A Nerve Gear that can even cause a person to blow up their brains. Little did he know that he would change the world. With a unique skill that would reverse the tip of all morality and in support of Wimps: The farmers will rise against the rich landlords with their pitchforks. The Holy War will have both Dark Knights and Crusaders see the End of the World. And worst of all, animals in the rainforest will be searching to eat him. But currenlty, he is online, and he said something unexpected: “I LOVE YOU!” “H-H-Huh…!?” It was the beginning of it all... Prologue:  Spoiler A girl was panicking. She sweated from head to toe. Everybody was watching this like it was some fascinating gossip. It was extremely interesting because the Code of Honor of the young man was called “Wimp.” Everybody had “Soaring Eagle” and such that they looked down upon him all the time. W-What the hell am I saying!? The young man was also panicking, unable to handle his emotional stress. He was soaring above 150 beats per minute. Ba-dum ba-dum ba-dum… Everybody could hear it. “I have a plan.” Suddenly, he calmed down to only 80 beats in a few seconds. Ba~dum, ba~dum… Knowing that she was panicking, he spoke in a soft voice. “…..” He waited for her like a butler. A natural actor. “Um, b-but how are we going to—“ She hesitated a bit and was waiting for him to— “I have a plan. I will come to your home, and sweep you off so I, as the Prince Charming, will come and retrieve you, Princess Charming, and we’ll marry and live under one roof. We have been married for four years in this world, right?” He was unusually calm. People didn’t know whether he was a Wimp or a different person anymore… Looking at him, the sissy girl, whose name was actually Sissie, looked at him, all scared and didn’t know who he was. She liked wimps, because she was one herself, so she liked him. “Let’s kiss.” Even though she didn’t know what to think of anymore, she was dragged in towards the kiss. Pink curly lips met chapped lips, one with obsessively curled hair and the other with shabby… Lips were getting closer. Only one centimeter away— “BOOM!” What the hell is going on here…!? A release of air filled the whole world. And then, trembling boots all around. “W-Why do I feel like running away…?” “I-I don’t know, but I’m scared for some reason…” The spectators around were all trembling in fear, unable to handle the World Fear and Paralysis put on them now. And their eyes were all bulging out, staring at the source. Suddenly, a new notice came to his status screen. Name: Robby Code of Honor: (Overly Emotional) Wimp And below the Level 9 Stats, the notice about a new skill: Congratulations! You have gotten a new Skill! Every other skill was on there, except for a Unique Skill: Skill Name: ******** Description: ***************** “W-What the hell is this…!?” He looked at it one more time, staring hard and bulging his eyes out— His veins were going to blow up. Skill Name: Traumatic Burst Description: Traumatic Burst, a Unique Skill whose strength is based on the Player’s emotional stress. Causes temporary confidence, and temporary Paralysis and World Fear in every Player, both foe and ally. Only applicable to Code of Honor “Wimp.” Supports Wimp and destructive to opposing Codes of Honor. Becomes stronger if Player encounters Codes of Honor opposite to his. Affects both ally and foe. And a special personal message below: You will be recruited soon. Since you’re the only one who’s like this, then you’ll— “W-What the hell is going on heeere…!?” Everybody except the young man was still able to speak. “…No way can I kiss you now.” …But he was obnoxiously calm. Even the girl in his arms was shaking. “Aauuu… Aauuu…!” He was staring at her. A toxic air full of mercury had filled the surroundings. And now, the girl was angry. “I-I couldn’t control it. The new Skill is—“ “I-I’m logging out!” She was pressing the buttons to log out— “W-Wait—“ Before he could touch her, she turned into crystal and disappeared. “No, this can’t be! What the hell is going on heeeere…!?” And he began crying. “Uwaaaah…!” While he was crying, elsewhere: ************************* In a land ruled by rich landlords: The landlords are affected by World Fear and are temporarily paralyzed. You will donate all your money and land to the poor, and to redeem your soul in hel— “W-What ish goin’ on here!? I-I’m sheeing something…! A-a future full of shabby reboots…!” Meanwhile, the farmers: You will be able to live in a land without being ruled by the rich. Everybody will be equal, and you will be delivered freedom from servitude— “Yes, we did it, Oyaji!” “Ahlright, ret’s get sum pitchforks!” And suddenly, the farmers started gathering around the landlords… ************************* Meanwhile, elsewhere: In a Holy War between two kingdoms: Absolute light and absolute dark, they are— Just as the Dark Knights and Holy Crusaders were about to slice each other— The Holy Crusaders read the message: The Earth is erupting. It is restless and the Apocalypse is coming— “I-I gotta go…!” “Guaaah…!” “A-A divine light, I’m seeing it…! I-It’s our Savior…!” Induced by World Fear, the Holy Crusaders stop their swords. The Dark Knights stop and read the following message: The world will be shrouded in divine light. A utopia will be created and rid the world of all evil— “Aaaah! What the hell!? The Dark Knight was speaking in American Engrish. "I ahm shposed to fill waurd ebir—“ “Guaaah! Mah ais ar barning…! Dis too braight…! A-Ais are exprode—“ Because Engrish is, apparently, a very "one-of-a-kind language", there is a displayed public message that rewords itself with an advanced AI machine translator. Letters keep changing themselves on the public messages. Here are the real meanings: (I am supposed to fill the world with evil--) (Guaah! My eyes are burning...! This is too bright! M-My eyes are going to explode--) Then suddenly, they stop and faint. They all drop down and cry, some of them even running away to bash their heads against mountains— ************************* Meanwhile, yet another place: In a national rain forest, the villagers were having a discussion: “Ooh ooh?” (What is it?) A monkey is communicating with another. The animals also have yet the same message translator with advanced AI machine translation. “Oooh ooh ah ah ah?” (I didn’t feel anything. Did you?) “Ooh ooh ooh.” (Nope, nothing.) Then, there were other animals gathering to listen to a sermon. “Ooh ooh?” (What’s going on there?) “Ooh ooh.” (Seems like they’re going to listen… We should go too.) At the top of the mountain was a lion king with a red mare. “Raaawwr!” The text was massively made big on purpose by the lion AI to make it readable for animals with glasses eyes: (I smell royal meat! It smells like Cocoa Puffs!) “Raawr!” (Let’s get it!) “ROOooAR!” (It smells like BBQ!) All the monkeys were looking at them: “Ooh ooh ooh?” (Are they dumb?) “Ooh ooh.” (Yes, they are.) “Ooh ooh?” (Want to make a deal with them that gives us bananas?) “Ooh ooh ah ah ah!” (Yes! I want bananas! I’m nuts for them!) All the monkeys gathered around: “Ooh ooh!?” (All for one!?) “Ooh ooh ah ah!” (One for all!) And thus, on a national scale, it came to be known as “The Gaseous Truth”… 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
