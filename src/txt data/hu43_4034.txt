 Chris Kyle-American Sniper

Fox News admitted to completely fabricating "no go zones" but I still have friends and family on Facebook who swear that "no go zones" or the like are real and even in the US. That is the power of media combined with ignorant and stupid people. Those are two completely different examples and it makes zero sense to try and draw comparisons between them. Fox News is supposed to be a news source that reports facts to the general public. Of course if they lie some people are going to believe them. American Sniper is a movie with actors and actresses telling a story and at no time attempts to deceive the audience into believing that the events occurred precisely as they are portrayed. It showed war from the perspective of one individual and took no political stance otherwise.
