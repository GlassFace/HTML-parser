 Pretty much, she's like two different people depending on what kind of scene she's in. Serious one second, falling over herself the next. 
 Episode 4 was something intense.  Spoiler SHE KILLED THE DAMN HOLLOW AND THEY TOOK THE STONE FROM HER!!! She could have got money for that. Also Akihito's true form is crazy! So much damage they could not even contain him. I am upset this show is only 13 episodes, they could pull 26 or at least have 2 seasons. There's so much more we need to learn! 

 Yea, 4th episode seemed alot better than the ones before it  Spoiler Though it seemed like something that needed to happen to get her to accept he understood her, so maybe it'll just go back to how it was, but now with progression in their friendship/romance happening now. Really have no idea what else they would do, unless they start hunting down the real hollow shadow (Said that thing she killed wasn't really it if I remember correctly) or they find that girl and try and get forgiveness from her for killing her sister.

I couldn't have been more right. PS, I'm starting to like this anime a lot more now from this episode. They're finally starting to shed light on the characters and their backgrounds.

  Spoiler Could have sworn she did sell it and it was pretty much worthless, maybe I should go rewatch those scenes if I'm wrong Edit: Yea, I didn't dislike it before, but it was in a weird spot of just good enough to be worth watching, and wondering if I should drop it. This episode changed that alot more in favor of sticking with it

If you watch the very end  Spoiler Izumi the older sister of Hiro and Mitsuki, delivers the real hollow shadow stone to some old man. So the story will probably progress with that also the fact that Akkey is a terrible Youmu, plus theres still story with Kuriyama as well. Edit: Yeah we're set now. :3 It seems like next week we'll get to learn more about Mitsuki which Im exicted for because I like her design. Also Kuriyama better join their club hahaha.

I never watch the ending themes so I always miss when they stick more of the show behind them ;_;  Spoiler I meant more like the main focus of the show, which I don't think they'd make his youmu side the main direction they pursue, but I think they will go with her story and deal with her past and things like that. Sure we'll be seeing more of that girl that was hunting them through out the show

I skip closing credits too but I skip to the preview to make sure I don't miss anything. It's way too common these days to add important plot elements after the ED. I also pay attention to where the ED starts on the timeline in order to gauge if there might be more animation at the end of it.

I've always disliked that though, previews are fine after the ed, but why have the ed and then continue the show?  Spoiler and yea, I got it now, guess he was off when he said they wouldn't lie about it. Though that was about it being worthless, which the one they swapped it out with actually was. Really curious as too why they stole it though, I doubt it was just for the money, think it's gonna have to do with something important in the story and driving it forward. Though I could be wrong and they never mention it again

Like when they don't show the opening for a long time, sometimes not even until episodes into the series.

I'm excited though cause they definatly showed what the show could be in that episode so my hopes are high. 
 Is it worth watching *Q*? I has no idea.

 A slice of life and feels episode is always good after a serious episode.  Spoiler "I want a Candy Apple Brother" "WHOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" Lol too funny. 

 Originally Posted by Sora Senpai A slice of life and feels episode is always good after a serious episode.  Spoiler "I want a Candy Apple Brother" "WHOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" Lol too funny. That was probably my favorite part Though the message of that episode was kinda depressing. "Everybody is all alone" ;_; 
 I was kinda disappointed that this episode was very slice of life despite the events of the previous episode. Maybe this was wrong of me to expect, but given the opening and the first ep, I was kinda hoping for a moe/shounen/Kara no Kyoukai type thing........ If that makes any sense. Right now its so slice of life and moe that the whole youmu and Spirit World Warriors thing seems kinda....hmmmm... not pointless but sidelined. Come one Kyoto Ani. You are capable of really awesome things outside of moe. Now do it! 
 I'm in love with this series so far so that must mean it's not going to be a long one. The mix of action and slice of life is perfect in my opinion. You're not always watching constant battle something like DBZ and then you're not watching another B.S. Lucky Star etc. The colors in this series are stunning. It's like moving art sometimes. With such an interesting story that has need ideas of characters and then even some classic niche you can't really go wrong. It's very unique. I guess the only thing I don't like is the one really cliche  Spoiler Boy has power to destroy everything like usual but, I guess the difference would be is that he doesn't want the power and he hates when he's consumed by it.

 "It's now time for our secret weapon!!!"  Spoiler LOL I friggin LOVE that they sang. I loved the song and voices, I was fan boy squealing XD A solid episode, very funny

 One of the funniest episodes I have seen this year. Seeing them act out of their normal character for once was hilarious. Also the guys in the background dancing..... I couldn't stop laughing 
 Hmmm I think I'll start watching this but i'm still not sure! Some people tell me it the maximum of boredom and others tell me it's fantastic! So unsure... 
 So I just watched the latest episode. I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING HELP.  Spoiler And the reaction faces of Hiromi when he met Mitsuki and Mitsuki when Kuriyama's singing are priceless lol No meaningful progress on the story, but dang it was really entertaining. Originally Posted by Trianna Hmmm I think I'll start watching this but i'm still not sure! Some people tell me it the maximum of boredom and others tell me it's fantastic! So unsure... If you're a fan of moe (though sometimes misplaced) sword wielding girl, or just like what KyoAni makes like myself, it really is worth the time. And those people who said this is a maximum boredom maybe because of the rather slow pacing. It's all back to you though. I myself won't regret watching this. 
 Life is a process--just one thing after another. When you lose it, just start again. ~OSU! Profile~ 
  Spoiler Oh, and during the entire last performance I was wondering the whole time who was going to actually kill the yomu, if everybody was part of the idol group. Sure enough.... lol. xD
