 Anyone attend Conventions here in England ?
 I have been to a few conventions over the past few years, none of which I have cosplayed. I don't think I will ever cosplay, purely because it's not my thing but I do think people who cosplay are well cool for cosplaying. I went to Eurogamer 2012 (September) MCM Comic Con 2014 ( Around Easter I think) I might be going to a few this year, if I can fine the time and see if any of my mates will go. Does anyone go to any here in England ? There's one in Southampton in March I may attend.
