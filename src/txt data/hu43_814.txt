[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires - Page 3
 Glad to see that there will be a second season coming this October! I wish Rukino would have actually said yes to Haruto, it would have definitely made things more interesting but now it looks like were back at square one. I can't help but notice the beginning with Rukino talking to someone that I'd assume is her child? He had grey hair so that kinda threw me off, what if she actually ends up with L-Elf? Unless that was Haruto's kid, anyways I can't wait for season 2 so many questions to be answered. 
 ^ wait.....episode 12 was the last ep of season 1......it ended sooner thatn I thought. I wish Attack on Titan would be at the same pace as Valvrave and not drag it on... anyway, episode 12 left me haging...now I want more....of this anime on steroids

I thought it would be 20 - 24 episodes. D: Will waait for the next season EDIT:  Spoiler From the last episode...I didn't expect the crazy Isolated girl to be piloting 'Unit 06'

 Fantastic show, and a cliffhanger ending to the season! Valvrave and Crime Edge both turned out to be real risk takers and surprisingly beautiful epic shows. Can't wait for the next season! I hope Crime Edge gets theirs in the fall as well. They also had a Season 2 teaser which makes me think a lot of preparation has already been put into it.

A lot of it seems to be Bandai and Sunrise having some fun with the usual mecha tropes. Like, wildcards keep getting thrown in on a regular basis every episode, but it's written well enough that it doesn't feel like it's ever actually jumped the shark. The story itself has gotten a lot more defined, although quite a bit darker as well. The main character, Haruto, hasn't changed a whole lot fundamentally, but he definitely gets stronger as it's progressed. Overall I like it a lot, definitely one of the best shows this season. I'd say watch episode 2 and/or 3 and if it doesn't grab you by then it's probably just not the show for you. It mostly hasn't taken itself too seriously and I think some people may have gotten the wrong impression about it with the way it started. Because of that I think you might have trouble finding a reviewer who is going to be able to give you the sort of analysis you're looking for; how any given person interprets the show is going to strongly rely on how much mecha they've watched, especially stuff like Code Geass or Gundam SEED and similiar. My thoughts exactly...the first few eps I was like mwah, now I'm at 11 and will watch 12 tomorrow due to some obligations I need to fulfill with the misses, but damnit do I want to watch the finale! It got me hooked right about the half way mark. At first I also thought here we go again, douchebag character, simple shounen/mecha-ish plot, shallow characters...but boy did that one blew back in my face. Where Suisei no Gargantia, imo anyways, started off awesome and then became just allright, Valvrave the Liberator did it the other way around. Apart for the cheesy song, some other corny high-school stuff, and the need to show how many 'likes' they get during fights this is one of the better shows this season...whoops gotta go now...lol Ow and that rape thingie wasn't all that big, shocking story-wise, but not perverted or something...wished they explained it a bit more do... 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!

I actually really liked that song, and ripped a copy of it from the episode to play on my mp3 player! xD I know, I'm weird.

 Can't wait for season 2 
 It's been quite some time since I've watched any anime. The last "recent" anime I had watched was 00 Gundam: Season 2 nearly 4 years ago. After many recommendations to start watching Valvrave, I finally gave in and started giving it a go. I'm definitely a huge fan of the artwork thus far. Both Katsura Hoshino and Yun Koga have very similar art styles and I get quite the 00 Gundam vibe from watching Valvrave. I definitely dig the Mecha designs, but ultimately, I still prefer the iconic Gundam designs. Not going to lie, but Episode 2 looked like a very stylized Musha Gundam fighting a very stylized Qubeley crossed with a Zeong. Valvrave vs Dorsia Ideal Mecha Musha Gundam Qubeley Zeong Definitely got to say though, I didn't particularly miss the cheese that the Japanese tend to gravitate to. The first episode was horribly predictable and very Gundam-esque. I partway almost expected the first episode to mirror Gundam Seed (given the nature of how things unfolded) but I'm extremely glad it didn't turn out that way 100%... although, not particularly fond of this... Vampire thing going on. At the very least, I'm intrigued. Will definitely keep going.

 Just don't take it too seriously! It's a really damn silly series for the most part, with a lot of tongue in cheek jokes poking fun at code geass, gundam, etc. It's not just a parody, but those elements really stand out as it goes on, especially several of the characters. 

 There is nothing special about this show. I don't get the hype. 
 I think the anime is pretty interesting 
 1 month till the show is back! Anyone hyped yet?

 Yes, I can't wait! It's back in October! Yay!

 Is there an exact date for the first episode of the 2nd season? I know October but the 1st would be different than the 30th....lol 
[IMG][/IMG]

 So happy that the second season has started now! <3

 Great start to the season! Little slow with the pacing, but lot of infodump kinda stuff going on. The subatomic particle junk was just dumb pseudoscience, but it's all good since we're on track for more crazy vampire crap.
