[Mecha] Captain Earth
 I feel like I was watching you watch this show. Which I found more entertaining that the show itself. I thought the same thing about crossing the streams. Aces mate. As for me, the title had action and mecha. I delivered on what it was aiming for. But it had a lot of plot that was left on the cutting room floor, and the convenience of how things happened and the fact that almost no one Â Spoiler died made me less worried about the characters. It had fun parts, the color schemed mecha was nice. But ultimately I was never wowed by the main conflict. I call this popcorn-mecha. It is fun with butter and salt, but you would get sick if you ate too much. Thank got is was not a 50 episode title.
