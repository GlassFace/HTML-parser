 Favorite Gundam series? - Page 2
 What's everyone's favorite Gundam series, and why? Mine is(are) a tie between Zeta, Unicorn and 00. Zeta, because it was sort of dark, and the story was actually pretty good. Plus Kamille was a great protagonist. Unicorn, because the story was, in my opinion, better then Zeta, and The Unicorn Gundam is awesome. I also grew to love Banagher over time, as you can tell by my name, haha. 00, because the Exia, and 00 Raiser are two of my favorite robots of all time, and I actually really enjoyed the story, especially the story of the second season. The fight scenes were great too, and trans-am was pretty cool.
