[Anime] Anime that makes you think
 I would have to say death note lol. even though I am sure you have already seen it. it is though provoking and mostly an insightful show. but other than that uhh the mardock scramble three movie anime series was also one that I found myself mostly being drawn into introspection to understand which direction the concepts in that movie came from and which directio0ns they were headed. also mirai nikki I heard was though provoking and rin daughters of Mnemosyne. also boogeypop phantom was one that required tons of understanding. just my opinion lol
