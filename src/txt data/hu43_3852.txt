 Blu Ray and DVD Steelbook Thread
 I was wondering, if anyone like me collects steelbooks. I know this is a longshot, being as it is a pretty niche market but one can only hope. I have 3 videos on my youtube, showing my collection to date I have 36 Blu Ray steelbooks and 9 DVD steelbooks. I also have a few games, of which I have steelbooks of to. If requested I will be happy to list them.
