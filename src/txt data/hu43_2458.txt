 Haruki Murakami Fans?
 After Dark is really great (plus the cover for the version I have has shiny silver dots on it). I loved that one, it's relatively short and not a very complicated story, but it involves a lot of interesting stuff. It's also one of the few stories of his where I liked the male lead. I haven't read Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, because I purchased Dance Dance Dance (gotta love those titles). Haven't had time to read the latter yet because of school, but might during a train ride this weekend. Maybe I'll pick up the book you mentioned when I go to the bookstore next. The only books of his I own right now are Dance Dance Dance, Norwegian Wood, Kafka on the Shore, After Dark and 1Q84. The bookstore I usually go to isn't in a big enough place so there's not always a lot of his books available. I did come across one cashier who became extremely excited that I read Murakami's works. Maybe because I'm a girl, and not many girls I know have read much of his books oddly. I'd have read them all because my boyfriend owns them, but sadly his are all back in Asia. lol
