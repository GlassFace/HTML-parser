 L.o.L.
 Well this is a new story I'll be working on along side any of my other story's I may be working on. So I guess there is a main story I am working on like Soul Cry or Encounter at the moment, even my Bloodline or Kings series but this is a stand alone which won't tie into my other series at all. It's a slice of life story/romance/mystery and is kind of based off the idea of the Breakfast Club even though I've never seen that movie only bits of it but I'm familiar enough with it that I get the general idea behind it. The story's format will be journal entry's from each of the four characters. Well, enjoy my attempt at this I'll probably get the first chapter out today besides this prologue. This image represents my May Castner character. I always like an image to go with my story so this is it for now, unless I find a better one which I hope to. Prologue; Journal Entry 82 - Luke  Spoiler I hate to have this sound like some corny movie narration, but to understand our story we’ll begin from the start, not that that contradicts what I just wrote, but what happened to us, is to say the least… Extraordinary. During our freshmen year, the first day to be precise is when all of this began. All of the students were handed a blue notecard that had two boxes to check with a single word next to each. One was accept while the other was decline. The instructions given with the notecard whereas followed. “If you accept or decline it won’t matter, just put your full names on the back and pass them up once you’ve finished. Please don’t leave them blank.” The others would later tell me that they had all checked the accept box, I included. Though we didn’t give it much thought until the following year when each of us were given a leather bound notebook and told to write down our findings. We were ask to open the notebook after school was out that day. Getting home a little late, I went to my bedroom to open the journal to find out what Mrs. Keen had meant when she told me to write down my findings. Follow the rumors. Besides that the page also gave some simple instructions to think of the notebook like a personal journal and write down your day to day activates. We would have our grade risen one letter if we did well. Shrugging I accepted, never thinking twice of what it all meant. I saw it as a fun game, within the instructions we’re told to keep the notebook hidden for there are five other with one, each of us are supposed to listen in the halls for the rumors and write down what we find and I found mine a few days into the start of the new school year. Kaycee. Just a name, and nothing more. Not even a last name. Our job is to become friends with the other notebook holders or at least try and see if we’ll remain friends. This is basically like finding a random person at the mall and striking a conversation with them. It’s not that easy for any of us to have friendships though. But me being as stubborn as I am, I like to figure things out, to understand. That’s who I am. Curiosity killed the cat. That fits. But we did, all of us. Even though one was my brother however our relationship has never been solid until after what happened. To be honest I found out my brother had one pretty easily, came into his room one night and the leather bound book was right on his desk. Vince Stein. May Castner. Mami Saotome. Ricky Ovrille. …and Kaycee. We’re now friends. I’ll end this last entry here, there isn’t anything more to be said, and the police are here to gather our notebooks to present them as evidence in the conviction… 502 Words Edit 1: Did a bit of editing, I can't figure out how to add the 4th character...Ricky if you remember what I posted earlier so he's out of the story. Edit 2: ...Ricky has to be in there, my story won't make sense with only 4 characters...well it will but I'm slowly see how I can use Ricky in the story and he just belongs. I also reworded and edited the prologue, enjoy.

 Why did i immidiatly expect league of legends XD Since L.o.L is the shorter word for it XD 
 ^ Nah, it doesn't mean either League of Legends or in text lingo, Laugh out Loud. It's suppose to be ironic I guess with the text language but it actually means Lessons of Life.

 Chapter 1; Diary Entry 2 - Mami  Spoiler We got a new girl in class today, her name being May Castner. She was dressed funny like she was pretending to be a witch but its nowhere near Halloween its only a few weeks into September and the school year just started for us sophomores. Her outfit consists of a witchs hat with a white band around the base connected to the rim and a black cape which rest just above her waist. Although I know that the school dress code doesnt allowed hats, shes been excused from that and were told to be extra nice to her and try to help her in any way we think we can. One student asked if the new student had special needs and Mrs. Bacon told us no, just thats shes a little nervous and that she could use some kind people around her so she can feel adjusted and welcomed. She was then lead in. Im supposed to be detailed in my diary so I would describe May as Mrs. Bacon told us, new to the school. Always looking down at the ground. She doesnt have any confidence as she told us her name in the quietest tone possible. She did gaze up at all of us but only briefly and through tired eyes, like she hadnt had a good nights rest in a while. Gray and hidden behind frameless glasses. Her hair a light brown; chopped short with two small pig tails resting on both shoulders. Excluding the witchs outfit she does look to be dressed normally with a plaid skirt. Dark nylon beneath the lace underskirt and a plain white long-sleeved blouse. The teacher stepped out shortly after while telling one of the studentsa tall guy in a wheelchairto lead the class in the math lesson while I was asked outside into the hall to talk with Mrs. Bacon after May got scared off because one of the other girls made a rude joke about her outfit and she started crying then ran out of the room. I was asked to chaperone May around the school so she can get used to the building and maybe even become my friend. May didnt want me to but the teacher insisted and so after we returned to class and everyone remained hushed as Mrs. Bacon continued the math class. Thanking the tall guy while he wheeled himself back to his table near the door. The bell rang signaling the next period and we left. I lead her around, telling her about the school while we walked to our next class when she asked to use the restroom. I showed her the way, even going in with her to wait near the sinks and check my make-uplooking to see if there was any smearing or the likeswhile she used the stall and when I heard the bell ring she told me to go on ahead. I didnt want to leave her but she insisted, telling me shell find me later for the rest of the tour, maybe during lunch break. She never did show up though and I continued all my classes as I would, Im a straight A student and I wouldnt dream of missing a class to go search for her. I figured she found someone to help her more so than I could have and after school ended I went to my cheerleading practice. Extracurricular activities are a great to show on your records when trying to get into a great collage. I cant say Ive picked one out yet but my parents have already brought me to take tours around some of the grand collages as well as a few outside of the state. Ive gotten a bit carried away with other subjects when Im supposed to be listening in the halls to rumors but Ive heard nothing. I only write this entry towell it doesnt matter, if doing this, and solving the mystery that Mrs. Keen mention boosts my grade, Im fine with that, easy A right? 675 Words

 Journal Entry 1 - Luke  Spoiler How would I describe myself? Kind and fair, intelligent and cunning. I can outwit my brother Vince easily but thats beside the point. This is about me. The instructions tell me to describe myself and be detailed. Im around five seven when standing, but since my accident in middle school during a track meet I now sit at half that height and in a wheelchair. Im thinner than I once was too, I cant build up the muscles like I could and I hate that. But the pressure from my dad being the coach of the track team at that time was way too much for me and I slipped up. My second year of middle school began with me in a wheelchair and from there on I had to live as such. I guess its luck that my high school is a single story. I live with my brother and dad, our mother though, shes gone, not dead just gone, she left our dad and hes not shared with us why yet, always saying when your older and over a beer. Funny that though, he let us both have a sip of his beer once and we ended up spitting it out, thats stuff bitter and doesnt taste like anything but hed laugh and told its like coffee, its an accrued taste. Told us he was the same way but thanks to our mother leaving him he got into it, but never going overboard Why am I talking about that? Well my eyes are blue and my hair blond, cut really short, just longer than a buzz. No sideburns and my face Ill describe it as thinI feel like Im anorexic but Im not that far gone, but being in a wheelchair doesnt help with that. Im paralyzed from the waist down and I receive daily exercise from a nice woman named Mrs. Ovrille at school. Shes a physical therapist thats especially there for the students whom are either physically disabled or mentally. There are others but shes one whos followed me though middle school and helped me with my needs. If I dont have my legs pumped like Im on a bicycle everyday they will deteriorate even more. Vince, my brother has helped a few times, and even less my dad in this matter, I feel hes disappointed in me Thats enough of the sad stuff. As to the rumors, this is the first day with the book, I only just found out Im supposed to be listening to rumors. Well there is that new girl that Mrs. Bacon my first period teacher mentioned to me this morning. Shes a math teacher and Im great at math so she treats me like a class pet, I cant say I enjoy it but she always lets me teach some in class if shes busy, she finds my teaching skills any nice change of pace in class. May Castner was her name I believe and well all be meeting her tomorrow. So thats enough about me for one night, its late and Im sure Ill be getting a ton of homework so I want my rest. I listen more closely to the rumors tomorrow, if there are any. Maybe this is just a dumb test but who knows. Mrs. Keen is kind enough I doubt shes trick us. I wonder who the other five are though. 566 Words I feel this song fits the story or plot well but besides I just like the song.

 I have a question that I was wondering after reading the first journal entry. First to say, you're an amazing writer, and I definitely love your style. Back to what I was say, sorry. In the first journal entry you said that everyone got a note card, they wrote their name on it, and checked one of the boxes. I am assuming that everyone that checked yes got a leather bound notebook? Or did only 5(or 4) specifically get them? I am a little confused on that part, nut otherwise I love your work and cannot wait to read more! 

 ^ Originally Posted by from Prologue “If you accept or decline it won’t matter, just put your full names on the back and pass them up once you’ve finished. Please don’t leave them blank.” I'm not going to add anything more, that is something for the reader to figure out. Thanks for liking this story and I hope you read others of my work. But they are longer stories and more words within each chapter so I understand if you don't.

 I'll be writing plenty more to the story, what I mean by I won't be adding anymore is if I tell the reader everything than there is no mystery to the story, I want the reader to think on what they are reading and figure things out as each new piece of information comes up.

 Ah okay then 

 Long time no see. I've went through difficulties like Luke, and my personality. Heheh, he's a lot like me in that, when he's having his own thoughts, that we both don't even know why we talk it out. XD So far, Luke's entry has been the best for me. To put to use the good technique of happy to not so good is something that most writers probably wouldn't think of. But for such a brief couple of chapters, I really liked it! And it's a good change of pace too. I noticed that I've been like you when it comes from jumping from thing to thing, except it's mostly games. But I've been gone from Soul Cry so long that I don't really feel like rehashing myself. That gives me the idea that an occasional story rehash with readers for long time of one of your stories wouldn't be so bad. At least, I seem to be the only one. 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
 Journal Entry 2 - Luke  Spoiler No rumors yet, though I’m not even sure what I should be listen to. This is a high school, there are thousands of rumors everywhere, how am I supposed to pick out a single one and figure that is the correct rumor? Just today I heard at least seven separate ones each about different people, none of whom I know, but maybe I can look into finding others with the book as a means to collectively gather more information, that is part of what we’re trying to do. We’re as in me and the five others. We do have the whole year though, I can’t expect the rumors or people to just pop out on me and figure I can quickly rush though this. Mrs. Keen even said this isn’t something to rush so maybe I’m being impatient. Well, for today’s events, only one stands out which I’m appalled by. As I said in my last entry, we’ll be getting a new girl in our class today. We have and she wasn’t anything like I was expecting. To say she is normal isn’t accurate, she’s probably the strangest one in our class now. Coming to school dressed as a witch. Mrs. Bacon did tell me she’s a bit odd and the whole class was silent as she gave her introduction which I doubt anyone heard very well. She has the quietest voice. Though she isn’t appalling, it was what a girl—I’m not very familiar with her but she started coming to our school a year ago as a freshman and she’s on the cheerleading team according to my brother. Mami Saotome. She’s Japanese decedent and has very long and smooth black hair almost like silk. I’ve never seen her tie her hair up and from what I remember she is a bit of a snot to everyone. Her eyes large and brown, the shape of almonds. She has the ‘I’m superior’ attitude yet always acts as if she’s the victim like today. May had finished her introduction and we were all saying hi to her and I was welcoming her to the class when Mami—who sits opposite of me from the door and a two rows back—made a comment to May I’m not sure I’d ever forget. How can she be so cruel? “Hey Hermione, I hear Dumbledore’s dead.” Most of the class started laughing while I watched May’s reaction, one of nervous caution turn to a teary eyed girl running out of the room followed shortly by Mrs. Bacon. I wanted to yell at her but what good would that do, she’s a snot and I’d just get in trouble when it’s not my place to do anything. She’s terrible and if I ever respected her before, I do not now. It was a few minutes until the class died down with their needless laughter, I can’t believe the class would follow her lead and laugh at such an idiotic joke which hurt the new girls’ feelings. We’re even told to make her feel welcomed before she was introduced and now, I doubt she’d feel welcomed at all. Mrs. Bacon entered and stood in front of the room and she herself looked as pissed as I felt and told them they should all be ashamed—I never did laugh and I had just as serious face as Mrs. Bacon did. Then she turned on Mami and told her she would contact her parents. She froze upon hearing this and she herself seemed nervous when she asked if she could escort May around the school. I’m not sure what our teacher is thinking, I wouldn’t let that slide but she tells Mami to follow her outside the room and in a quick bust tells me to teach the lesson that’s up on the board until their return. Wheeling myself from my table as they leave the room I head to the front of class to teach them the Math lesson, all the while in the back of my head I felt that Mami would get her way and get off without any kind of repercussion that she herself didn’t dictate. I was right. Later as I headed for my therapy after lunch with Mrs. Ovrille I paused while passing the restrooms. I heard crying and I immediately think of May. She’s in the girl’s restroom though so I fetch Mrs. Ovrille and tell her about May, and how I think it might be her in the restrooms. She gives me a sympathetic look as she leaves the room and heads down the hall toward the restroom only to come back a few minutes later with a redden eyed May, she seems to have been crying for a long time before Mrs. Ovrille went in and got her. Not much more to say, for now, I’ve decided to befriend May who seems very skittish and I want to make sure Mami gets her just deserts, I’ll be talking with Mrs. Keen since I don’t have any time today, I have a study hall on Thursday, a few days from now and I can talk with her then about Mami’s actions. 862 Words This whole story rose from the joke said in this chapter and dictated who May is and will be. Odd but yah, this whole story came from that joke . XD

 Journal Entry 1 - Ricky  Spoiler I am not smart, average, probably less. I am also big, fat is a good word but I do not like to use it. I have deep black skin and am of African American decent. People make fun of me for all three and over the years I have gotten used to it, it is not fun and I do not like being used to it. The other students at my school are not nice and the only people I trust are my family. My kind mother who I have called Mum since I was young and my father, Pa. My mum is a physical therapist at our school. I feel this is because of me but I do not what her to think that. She seems happy so I do not want to ruin that for her. My pa is a police officer, high ranking too and hugs me every time he comes back from work, glad to be alive another day. Were we live is not unsafe but pa still treats work as if he would not come home that night. When I was young this was very hard for me to understand but I know now and like his work. Mrs. Keen gave me this journal at the end of the day yesterday and has asked me to follow what is written in the inside cover. Waiting until I got home from school that night as told, I opened the journal and found a photograph of a field. The journal also said follow the rumors but I do not understand. I was told this is my duty alone and I would get a letter grade up if I did well but I do not understand. I am surprised that I have written this much, I do not usually but it is for a grade. Earlier my mum wanted me to talk with a guy in a wheelchair named Luke but he was not focused on why he came to the room. Usually for exercise, he asked my mom to go check on the girls bathroom. He said he heard crying and when my mom came back, she brought with her a witch. I stayed out of it while they talked but that girl seemed so sad, I hope she feels better. 384 Words This was kind of hard to write because I love using descriptive words but considering who I am writing and trying to get a feel for him, I went with simple words as much as possible as well as trying to keep the entry short yet having everything I want in it. I'm also going to make a few changes to the prologue, the thing about the cards being a year apart from when this actually starts is too distant. I'm making it so its on their first day so by now, we are only on the third day so far of the week. Those cards are going to have a greater meaning then I had previously thought and I thank having to spend a few hours shoveling the snow and my long trips to and from work.
