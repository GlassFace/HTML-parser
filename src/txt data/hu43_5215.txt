 Fantasy Books
 Speaking of A Game of Thrones, I'm actually slightly afraid to read the A Song of Ice and Fire series now. I've never got into Game of Thrones and was considering watching it. A friend said that I should read the books first. Then he went on to say that he was very disappointed by the third book and stopped right there, scared to read any further for fear of it getting even worse. lol. When a series deteriorates, I am like that as well and I just can't bring myself to finish it. I do trust his judgement. Does it improve, or get worse as it goes on?
