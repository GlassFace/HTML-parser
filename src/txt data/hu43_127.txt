 Do you take requests?
 If you take direct signature requests, please make a post in this thread. I will update the first post with a list of names so that we can keep track of those that do. This will help people who want a sig to contact their favourite sig artists directly via PM rather than having a load of threads everywhere. Please note that we have a request thread above with many requests unfulfilled. Maybe some of you would like to take those on. ( Please note: If you would rather not have people PM you, don't add your name here, just take requests from the workshop in your own time and when you feel like it) Requesters please remember these people do it for free so be patient if you ask someone to take a request. Completed requests are to be posted in the completion thread above and you may ask critique in the bannerage on sigs you've made. ONLY GFXERS (Signature artists) POST HERE! IF YOU WANT A SIG... PM SOMEONE ON THE LIST OR POST IN THE WORKSHOP THREAD ABOVE. Thank you! Aozora VampiricCentipede Seidaki NorwegianMoose Chaoz Lily-Chan Silent_Zephy Shikinami_
