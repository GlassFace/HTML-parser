[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Wow, This anime is incredible. Episode 20 was just. Wow. I have no idea how their going to get out of this mess. But with this show everything is a surprise. And twists are everywhere. Also, This shows openings are pretty great. I especially liked the first one!
