 The best game on Earth's latest season begins in a little under two weeks! Yay! The drought is finally ending. Talk about the latest games, your favorite teams and players, news, projections and predictions; anything football related. But please don't whine about your fantasy team, no one cares. I'm hoping to see the Skins manage a better season than last thanks to a pretty huge overhaul in coaching. The Shanahans obviously were not working, here's hoping that Jay Gruden and his team can really make RG3 shine again. Also excited to see how the Ravens do with the multitude of weapons Flacco has this season. I know preseason games aren't anything to get too worked up over, but what I did watch looked very promising. - Also, gonna run the eliminator/pickem group again this year if anyone is interested! Use http://saseliminator.com/group/view/15 to join and the password is "anime". Pick'em is where you pick which teams you think are going to win their games each week; the winner is whoever got the most right at the end of the season. Eliminator is similiar, but you only pick one team per week and you can't pick the same team more than once per season, so it forces you to plan out your choices a bit more carefully. No prizes and it doesn't cost anything, but it's a fun little thing to do that can add some extra interest in games you might not otherwise care about!
