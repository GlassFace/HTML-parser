[Sports] No NHL Threads?!
 Well first of all, I did notice that there is an old thread for the 2012 Stanley Cup, but I was wondering if there are any other hockey fans in A4! I would love to have some hockey related discussions here too, I may not know much about smaller things in hockey history, but I'm usually up to date to the current stuff. Right now I am playing my 2nd season of high school hockey, played varsity my first year, but things are a little different so I might just play JV and then play some Varsity games, which I'm fine with. And I am planning to try out for Juniors Next Year!
