[Drama] Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April) - Page 3
 Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April, 四月は君の嘘) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Naoshi Arakawa. An anime television series adaptation by A-1 Pictures is scheduled to air from October 2014 on Fuji TV's noitamina block. Piano prodigy, Kousei Arima dominated the competition and all child musicians knew his name. But after his mother, who was also his instructor, died, he had a mental breakdown, while performing at a recital that resulted in him no longer being able to hear the sound of his piano even though his hearing was perfectly fine. Even two years later, Kousei hasn't touched the piano and views the world in monotone, and without any flair or color. He was content at living out his life with his good friends, Tsubaki and Watari until, one day, a girl changed everything. Kaori Miyazono, a pretty, free-spirited violinist whose playing style reflects her personality, helps Kousei return to the music world and shows that it should be free and mold breaking unlike the structured and rigid style Kousei was used to.
