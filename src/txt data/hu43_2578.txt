 Hacking- What Do You Think, A4?
 Hacking is just exploring/learning in my mind. Reverse engineering, bugs, hidden features, etc. By itself I barely think it's noteworthy. Cracking is more the break and enter type of activity. That's where most of your illegal activity is. Pirating, privacy breaches, etc. Script kiddies arn't anything. They are twits with cans of spray paint, that run around damaging things for no purpose other than to say, look at me. Overall, wether its hacking, or cracking, how and what they are used for or on dictate whether they are good or bad in that particular application. It's no different than a lockpicker, intention and purpose define it's legitimacy. Life hacks, while I abhor the term, are a simple example of how inert the basic principle is.
