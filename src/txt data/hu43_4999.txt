[Personal Life Discussions] First thing you would save in a Fire
 God forbid your house ever catches fire, but it it did what would be the first thing u would save/not counting Pets or Family members I would save my Art portfolio. 

 Art's a good one, most of my other stuff can be replaced with insurance. I guess things with high sentiment, like childhood photos or something. 
 ~A product of Raffee's silky skills.  Spoiler  Spoiler 
 Documents/ID certificates etc. the stuff that the government makes it a massive hassle to replace. Other than that tell the firefighters to wait for the ammo to cook off, and thank the insurance company. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 My computer and tablet...

 I'd probably save stuff like my SSN, Birth Certificate etc. You're screwed without that stuff Laptop would be next. I need something to do while I'm in some hotel when my house is being rebuilt 
 My phone if I did not already have it on me :P But if I did have it on me i'd try save a photo album or something irreplaceable.

 I would save myself, first and foremost. Second would be my PC. I spent a pretty penny and had her built over the course of several months. She is the culmination of years of hard work and money saving. She would be saved as an absolute. After that, if I could save my figures and displays, I would.

 My smoke alarm. Think about it. Whats are your documents, toaster, computer or flat screen tv gonna do for you when the heat gets turned up? Exactly. **** all. My toaster probably started the whole thing. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 I'd probably save "Wrinkles." The dog stuffed animal I've had since I was born. Everything else can burn... 
 I can't help but feel I wouldn't save anything from a fire. I'd be more mad about the fire and would be trying to put it out than worrying about getting anything out. But if I'm forced to choose.. I'd say my family. Cause it would kind of suck to lose the rest of my family in a fire and then be all alone. Unless I'm gonna turn into the caped Fireman. Fire insurance salesman by day, pyromaniac ass kicker by night. Wouldn't be so bad if I had a jetpack made out of fire extinguishers. Otherwise I'd grab my wallet or maybe some valuables, since I'll need it to pay for a motel, or gas... or food for the next few days.. Cause my house just burnt down.

 My own life... If I really have to choose something material...I'd quickly take one of my sports bag and put a few cloth changes in it. Probably my laptop (I'd be screwed without it because most of my school notes are on it). Probably a few of my most valuable books as well.

 Laptop, documents, and after making sure the cats have already made their escape, I'd probably grab the box of letters my dad wrote to my mother and me after they were separated and he was in treatment. Not necessarily for sentimental value, but because I haven't finished reading them yet and I may discover some sentimental value in them afterwards. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 Probably my laptop and camera SD cards. Gear can all be replaced, the raw files cant. Im not worried about any documents, we keep those in a fire safe anyway. Gotta be prepared for that ****. 
 Both Thanks to Sl33py =3 My Tumblr Click me and feed some needy shelter animals, for FREE! 
 My external hard drive and a few notebooks. Fortunately, they are all within arms reach.

What if they have no family and they all died in a horrible accident and now you just reminded them about that and not only that but you criticized them for it. You horrible monster.
