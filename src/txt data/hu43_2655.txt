 Suggestions for a Horror Anime please!!
 I watched a play-through of corpse party a while back. If the anime is even half as messed up as the game, I think it would be a good candidate for an excellent horror anime. I liked Another quite a lot as well. I heard from a friend that Yami Shibai was good. I think it's more about traditional ghost stories and not goreâ€¦but I could be wrong. I personally prefer the build up of a creepy atmosphere over gore. But thats just me.
