[Mecha] Neppu Kairiku Bushi Road
 Synopsis: The story takes place in a time when the world is in the pits of despair after being ravaged by a poison called "shinobi" that came to earth via an asteroid. The people run away to the place called "Kairiku," a place that used to be the bottom of the ocean. Here, the people try and protect themselves against the effects of the poison. In such a world, there was a single light of hope. The "Holy Weapon Giga Road" and the legendary warrior "Yagyuu" are needed in order to counter the effects of the poison. In order to save the world, Ame, a princess of a fallen nation, stands up in order to save the world. Neppu Kairiku Bushi Road (熱風海陸ブシロード Neppu Kairiku Bushirōdo?) is a Japanese media franchise that was originally announced in 2003 as a collaboration between the companies Gainax, Takara and Broccoli. After the death of story creator Sunao Yoshida and the departure of other staff members the project was put on hiatus, but was eventually restarted by Bushiroad in March 2013 with Bushiroad's president Takaaki Kidani as executive producer. A television anime is scheduled to air as a 3-hour special on December 31, 2013 as a collaboration between Bushiroad, Bandai Visual, Nitroplus and Kinema Citrus.
