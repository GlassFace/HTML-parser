[Personal Life Discussions] I keep scratching my arms till I bleed
 You need to see a doctor about this. I have a similar problem, although mine is triggered by eczema. Is a rash forming? When I'm under a lot of stress I tend to break out the most. Is this a fairly recent problem? I have a lot of scarring from the same problem. It might be related to anxiety if it's being triggered. But your best bet is to see a doctor about this. Don't be afraid to discuss this problem with them. Mine is slightly worse (my entire body plus my scalp) but getting the right help will make it easier to deal with. For now, wear light fabrics that won't bother your skin. On top of this problem, I've been dealing with unknown allergies that for some reason can't be detected. If you can get yourself to stop for a week or two it will generally go away. Getting professional help will benefit you greatly. If your skin is dry, use a good lotion every few hours when the moisture starts to fade away. That will help soothe your skin and maybe cause you to scratch less. I find it does for me. Don't wear scented products. I just use Aveeno lotion or lotions specific to helping with skin problems. If you're picking at your skin then you really need to tell your doctor.
