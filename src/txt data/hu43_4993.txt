[Anime] would you like ulquiorra to come back
 I would have to say yes. ulquiorra was the best character among every villain in the show almost any villain I have seen and nearly as awesome a ichigo himself. I have often wondered if ulqiuorra could pose a challenge to aizen atleast up until his second last and last transformations. on top of that we see now in the manga that many of ichigos previous foes have come back to face the wandenreich with ichigo and pals (which is not a new concept, as the gotei thirteen was originally ichigos enemy) we've seen arrancar, xcution and shinigami all come to ichigos aid. I personally think the one who finished quilge opie and was talking over the phone to ichigo was grimmjow himself. so do I know If ulquiorra is coming back? no not at all. but do i wish and hope he would. absolutely 100%. since he was one of the arrancar with outstanding power in the heuco mundo arc I think he would still be a serious opponent for almost any sternritter short of the elite sternritter and ywach but would make an excellent addition and to see his resurrecion segunda etapa in action once more would be cherries frosting and ice cream in my opinion. I would love it if he came back. he is almost my favorite character and quite possibly my favorite villain yes.
