 We all know what my obvious answer would be. But, instead, I'll talk about something else. Kill la Kill. I'm about eleven episodes into this anime, and I'm not really sure why it got all the hype it's got. It's not bad, but what exactly makes it so great? Is it because anime lately has been **** and this is one of the first anime to try to break away from the ****? That seems to be the justification. I should probably finish it before I can say it's overrated. I like it. 
 When I finally got it figured out, I've changed the whole damn plan. "Memorize this! Memorize Jeremiah Gottwald! Commit it to memory, because that's the memorable name of the man who has defeated you."
 Sword Art Online T_T""" 
Sand Cats are Bloody Adorable.

 All of them. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 These are ones I personally find overrated. Sword Art Online Code Geass Highschool of the Dead Naruto Bleach Evangelion Fate/Stay Night

 I've already mentioned in a similar thread that you can like whatever you want. Me personally? I haven't bumped into anything I feel was overrated. However I've only been on this site for six months. Before now I just used Wikipedia and google to find shows. I didn't know anything about fan bases for various shows. Most shows that have been recommended to me here have been great. Only a few weren't but I just didn't like the genre that's all. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 DBZ(do I really need to explain this one yet again) SAO(the biggest abomination in the history of the written word) Kill la kill(The way people were going on about this, hyping it up, I knew this was gonna suck, atleast compared to many of the things I've seen, but after reading the premise, I figured it might atleast be decent, but omg no it Isn't. Great premise, but nothing but a goofiness fest for a anime. It's so goofy, it puts fairy tail to shame, I can't fathom how anyone can sit through more then one ep of that crap) Fate Stay/Night(very good premise, but the bad scene choices and execution, makes it a meh series at best, I can't even bring myself to even call it just good, because it so Isn't on the lv 99% of just good anime, are. There's actually people who rate this as one of the best anime ever, and to that I must say stop watch POS, and start watching actually good, very good, nevermind greats, then you'll see how meh Fate Stay/Night is) Code Geos( I admit I haven't seen this, but there's a reason why I haven't, it looks just like any of the dime a dozen Sci fi/mech anime Sunrise loves to put out, wtf is so special about this one, I don't see it lol)

I've never seen an anime where I really thought it was overrated. Everyone's got their own tastes. I can understand the plot hole argument for some, but what form of media doesn't have plot holes? There definitely are anime I've seen where I thought they could have done better, like SAO, but I still enjoyed them.
