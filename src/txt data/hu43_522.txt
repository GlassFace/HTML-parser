[Event] Help A4 Throw the Biggest Birthday Party Ever!

Aren't you happy Im here? ^_~ Edit: Crap. Can't change lowells title or add naruto to the censor list. I guess I'll just join the rest of the old vets here in running the "In my days..." and "Get off my lawn"-events. First prize goes to the one who throws the most newcomers (anyone who joined after 2003) in the rancor pit.
