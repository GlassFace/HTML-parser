 Project 2501 an independent live action adaption of Ghost in the Shell.
 DreamWorks is in the process of trying to bring Ghost in the Shell to the big screen; however, they probably should be taking notes. Project 2501 is an fan film recreating the original Ghost in the Shell movie shot for shot as an homage to the Shirow Masamunes manga and Mamoru Oshiis film. I'd post the images here, but I can't seem to edit it down to fit the post. But you can check out my article at the Big Comic Page for the behind-the-scenes video where they recreate the famous opening scene (NSFW). We even have a side by side comparison of the animation and their CGI rendering. Enjoy!
