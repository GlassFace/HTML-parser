 Do you read the book first or watch the movie first?
 If you like to read it's almost always better to read the book first. Being able to use your own imagination to give life to characters without preconceived notions is more fun. Then you can watch the movie later and either agree with how they did it, or rail at the TV for them getting it wrong. Plus there are a lot of good books turned into bad movies, I can't remember as many bad books turned into good movies, so if you decide not to read the book based off the movie you could be missing out.
