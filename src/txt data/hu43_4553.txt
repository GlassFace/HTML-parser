 Yo! I'm new here XD
 Greetings from a fellow n00b! I used to do Amtgard back in the day, unfortunately nobody around here to do that with. I'm also a big music fan(I play drums for a rock and roll cover band). Seeing as you posted on my greeting thread you've watched most of the same anime as me I'm sure we'll get along
