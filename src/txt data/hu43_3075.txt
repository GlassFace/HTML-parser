 Anne Rice's Prince Lestat
 I read some of her books. First I liked the character of Nicholas but quickly he pissed me off. I like her writting skills but soon, in her books, Lestat becomes too quickly weak. So I just stopped at the fourth novel in the vampires chronicles serie. I've watched some movies too... The one with Brad Pitt is good enough.
