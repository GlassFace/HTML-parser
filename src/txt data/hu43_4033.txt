 Chris Kyle-American Sniper
 Can someone tell me now if they think movies like American Sniper actually cause violent acts? I'd love to know how one could arrive at such a conclusion. The movie by no stretch of the imagination encourages violence or war, it doesn't glorify it, and Seth Rogan is a known hypocrite who doesn't even apply his own standards for social responsibility to his own films. I don't understand what it is with these modern media critics making these sweeping radical statements about how viewing violent media can encourage people to commit violent acts. Some stupid tweets from people who obviously were racist to begin with prove absolutely nothing. Again, as I've asked a lot of hipsters, I'd like to see some real notable academic research on the matter instead of Jack Thompson level logic.
