[Manga] What kind of paper is Manga printed on?

But that is what they use if you're talking about the cheap-texture kind. Data on this site matches my guess ("Body manga magazine") http://www.kamifujiwara.co.jp/kami/kamimame.html Thank you! This is most certainly a step in the right direction. The follow up should be how this translates to printing companies based in the United States. For instance what does VIZ Media or Dark Horse use to print their manga books and did Shonen jump also print on Senkashi? These are the question I'm looking for the answers to. Price is not something I'm concerned over at this point, but it will factor in later on.
