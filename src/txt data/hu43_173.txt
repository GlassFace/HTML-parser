 Antisemitism in Red Dead Redemption
 Anyone notice how racist the storekeeper in Armadillo is? He keeps saying stuff like: "We don't sell any Jew merchandise" and stuff. Keeps taking about Jews over and over again. I know this is just an accurate reflection of the attitude people had back in the wild west, but do you think it will hurt Rockstar down the road? My guess is not, since they've done far worse in their games like GTA like attacking and killing hookers and the like, but they have yet to cross the racism barrier (at least, not that I know of). Personally, I'm not Jewish so it doesn't bother me as much, but I can't help but shake my head every time I walk into the general store and hear that. Kinda dumbfounds me. Opinions?
