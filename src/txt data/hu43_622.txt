Wheel of Time is a decent series. I wouldn't suggest it if you're still new to fantasy because there's much better stuff out there. Here are a few books that you might enjoy. GOAT fantasy: The Kingkiller Chronicle The First Law Trilogy The Stormlight Archive Fun magic-based fantasy: Lightbringer Mistborn The Reckoners Magician The Dresden Files Thieves: The Gentlemen Bastards (Lies of Locke Lamora) Assassins: Assassin's Apprentice The Night Angel Trilogy
