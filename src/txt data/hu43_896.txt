[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 You only watched the first episode? usually one should watch the first 2 or three to get a real feel of an anime. But whatever. And Mooo, what do you think? Assuming you've read a little through the thread, these past episode, It seems your interested. Just watch a few eps.
