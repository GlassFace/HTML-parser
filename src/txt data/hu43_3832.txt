[Anime] Favorite Engilsh voice actors anyone?
 I've watched so many dubs I can recognize most of the heavily employed ones by just there voices even when they are trying to change it up, pretty sad lol. 3 Guys Johnny Yong Bosch - Vash(Trigun), Lelouche (Code Geass), Renton (Eureka 7), and of course bleach Eric Vale - Future Trunks (DBZ), Sanji (One Piece), practically every male wh*re in every dubbed anime Christopher Sabat - Vegeta/Piccolo (DBZ), Zoro (One Piece), Kuwabara (Yu Yu Hakasho) Runner up Chuck Huber because Hiei is my all-time favorite anime character Honorable Mention Todd Haberkorn after a bunch of awesome supporting roles he final voiced a memorable lead character in Natsu from Fairy Tail 3 girls Colleen Clinkenbeard - Luffy (One Piece), Erza (Fairy Tail), Rachel (Case Closed) Stephanie Sheh - Okay she's in everything. Brina Palencia - From Tony Tony Chopper to the most adorable yadare character of all time in Yuno Gasai Runner Up Cherami Leigh. She has a very pretty voice, but usually plays a tough girl. Whats not to like? Yeah I went a little overboard, but does anybody else have some favorites on or off my list?
