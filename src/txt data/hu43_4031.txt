 Chris Kyle-American Sniper
 It should come as no surprise to me that there are many attitudes towards the story of Chris Kyle (1974-2013), pronounced as the most lethal sniper in American history. I was profoundly moved by the Clint Eastwood film yesterday, being a veteran led me to some heavy tears during it but I think I would have been touched regardless, a man's struggle with war and the home front would be a sure winner HOWEVER even this heroic human being is being regarded as a lair, a sociopath, etc, nothing seems to be simple. I've watched interviews of his wife, Taya Kyle who had nothing but good comments regarding Eastwood's retelling, the same goes for the widows of the seal team members who were lost in combat. So what is it with this man and this story that's drawing such different responses from people? Am I seeing this right or have I just been drawn to idiots who enjoy stirring up attention? Your thoughts on Chris Kyle and our country's attitudes regarding him and war. It would of course behoove of you to not get too extreme with each other if somebody has disagreeing opinions, though I'm interested in knowing why somebody finds fault with this man.
