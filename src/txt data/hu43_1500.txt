[Fantasy] Outbreak Company
 Wow, every time I think I have this coming season covered, I discover something else new and interesting! Seeing a lot of unique fantasy settings this season. Synopsis: Outbreak Company’s story centers around Shinichi Kano, a “thoroughbred class” otaku with a light novelist father and an erotic game artist mother. The NEET (not in education, employment, or training) high school dropout has no special talents except for his vast knowledge, opinions, and insight on moe. Despite this, the Japanese government assigns Shinichi as a “moe” evangelist to the Holy Eldant Empire, a parallel world with an entrance through a thick forest of trees in the Mount Fuji area. In this fantasy world where dragons soar the skies, Shinichi forms a deep friendship with the half-elf maid girl Myuseru and the beautiful young empress Petoraru. Even as he deals with the threats of war between different factions, he worries that he himself is an invader (shinryakusha) to this wondrous land. At first it runs as a comedy but later there are serious matters that Shinichi needs to face: ethnic discrimination, social problems, conflict with neighboring countries, sabotage by opposition elements including Japanese government, etc. Can he overcome the obstacles, successfully bring "moe" culture to the fantasy world, and help the people there as well?

 I do not care about the synopsis. I have seen anime females in maid outfits bearing guns (I don't care about the guns too much but they're fine). **** the synopsis this anime looks amazing.

 I want this kids job...NOW!!! I wanna be the Ambassador haha. 

 This could be good might look into it thanks for the post I probably never would've known about it XD 

 An ambassador for nerd kind, it's a pretty funny little concept... Wondering if they'll be able to stretch it out or'll just dive into their kinda cookie-cutter characters to pass the time. Love the Maid too, shes like that species of goat that collapses when they get startled. Y'know how there's that other breed of goat that climbs trees? Imagine if they crossbred the two. Walk on up to a tree, scream a bit, *thunk*

From what I've read the story gets more in-depth and delves into social commentary instead. The opposite of what you might think from the set-up. I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of depth this show produces after it gets past its initial comedy stage. You can already see a little bit of it in the first episode, like how the elven race is discriminated against in this world. They are the minorities of our world. There's a reason why a half-elf is working as an illiterate servant... and it's not for maid moe. She is stuck in her social status and needs to be taught that she is as much of a person as anyone else.

 I love how there are "Real World" anime in this world. aka  Spoiler Attack on Titans haha. Also there was an Infinite Stratos poster and a Devil is a part timer poster too haha. I enjoy when anime do that. But this show is funny and I am looking forward to hopefully the combining of two separate cultures. 

 I think is was Attack on Iron? LOL and I saw the Scientific Railgun poster too but with a different character obviously! XD

 Yup, Attack on Titan. When city guard Hannes rescues Eren and Milkasa at their mother Carla's bequest, as they try to get him to stop because their mother is going to be eaten.

 Wow, episode 3 just made me love this anime even more. I think it took a drastic turn, it reminds you that this anime is not all about having fun and enjoying all the moe. I'm glad Mieusalrekjwl is alright. XD I won't allow her to die!

 OH MY GOD!!!!! I didn't think we would get some awesome action this early but DAMN!!! It got me fired up! Minori is such a badass. I lost it when she told Shinichi to  Spoiler "Push deeper" Also the most feared weapon...a Fire Extinguisher haha. The ending though was epic. Myucel is awesome! 

 Followed up by one hilarious teaching episode...and a FURRY!!!! 

 lol, a furry. Was that an Otaku class? HOW TO BECOME AN OTAKU CLASS?

 Elbia in heat...sign me up. 

 For what it's worth, I loved Miname-ke Okairi! Though admittedly, the first season was still the best. Kana ftw! And wow, I've been waiting to see Myucel in a maid cafe!! @_@ My life is so complete! 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 If Myucel and Elbia were placed in front of me and I was told to "Choose one" Well...I just dont know. They're both too frigging adorable and hot. 

 I would pick Misuel, 'cause I still have a big thing for maids, especially now that she's maid cafe approved. Surprisingly, Outbreak Company doesn't even have my latest obsession, which is ninja loli. XD
