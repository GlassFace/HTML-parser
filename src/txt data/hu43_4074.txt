 Do you read the book first or watch the movie first?
 So with book based movies do you watch it first or read the book first? I usually watch the movie first. Then I'll read it if I liked it a lot. I've been reading the ian Flemming James bond books. Its been fun noticing the differences between the books and movies. Of course I've seen the movies first in this case. Which do you do first? Oh and also: Do you read novelizations of movies? I mean books made from the movies themselves, not a spinoff universe.
