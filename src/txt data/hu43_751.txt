 Soul Cry Redone
 Don't worry, the story is still titled Soul Cry, I am just beginning a new thread cause the old thread is from 2010 and got derailed long ago, but here it is: http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...highlight=Soul That being said seeing this work shows me that I'm a much better writer even though the work was done a few years back. Luna's writing didn't turn out near as good as the writing from here so I need to go back and write like this instead of how ever the hell I wrote Luna. Also I'm going to halt work on Venus: Second Encounter, but if people still want me to, I can finish that. Table of Contents:  Spoiler Prologue: Where to Begin?

So first thing if it's not clear after reading though some, is that Fate and Hope are Mike's daughters, this is clear later in the chapters, past 13. 2. Second is that Naomi never learns the name of her Soul Tool, again this is in the chapters preceding my decision to take it out and I have yet to edit my work so that this fact is in. Again this is once you get past chapter 13 3. Third is that Phil and Dave have gotten a name change. They are now Erin and Tom, in that order. 4. Fourth, Shells have been renamed to Husks. So these are things to remember while reading the first 13 chapters. Enjoy now. Here's the prologue and first two chapters. Prologue: Where to Begin?  Spoiler Where to begin? Heaven and Hell; do they even exist? Humans do not know this, for we are living, or what we call living, what humans came together to call something that is alive, something that is moving in flesh and that has a mind, a will to live. As long as humans have the will to live, we are alive, are we not? But what about death; when human bodies are cremated or thrown into the ground to rot, are humans no longer alive? Is death really the end for them? This goes without saying, all animals, for that is all a human is, an animal, the animal that dominates over other animals. Those on top choose what happens to those on the bottom. That is how it has always been and always will be. All things live, all things die. Whether a soul or not. All ends the same. Death. But what about before life begins, were we not already dead then given life in our mother’s womb by our father’s seed? Is that when the soul comes to the flesh given to us by our parents? Then this leads us to where the soul comes from. A magical thing, a magical word that humans have giving something that spawns from nothing, such as time, time is a word humans have labeled the orbiting Earth around the Sun, giving us years, months, weeks, and days. Time. Time is how we even label ourselves, by how many years, decades and so on that we have been on this small planet of ours. The soul; a collection of experiences which dictates us as we grow and age Every new experience we come into contact with changes us ever so slightly. For good or bad, what happens is our choice that’s already predetermined by our previous experiences. Then can this not be considered the soul because it is what makes us who we are, what we do, every action and reaction. A ripple in a pond? Our soul is essentially our personality. This is why, with age, humans grow wise. Humans who have already spent, and used up their time on this planet can now give their knowledge to those of the next generation, their sons and daughters, their grand kids. This is the only way humans know to progress, and probably will be the only way they ever do for all eternity. This is death. To leave the flesh that was once giving to them. What we see as death. As for the soul, where that ends up is entirely up to the experiences that the soul has had. Heaven or Hell, their choice—eternal life or eternal damnation. The soul is nothing but a blank slab waiting for a chisel. Which leads us to what happens when there is none, or when the soul does not know. When no experiences are introduced to the soul, when no personality is formed what does this become? A vacant shell? Nothing? Something? Anything? This is where our story begins; with one of these poor creatures, a human at one time though, now dead and slowly being consumed for the soul does not know regret. Now for you to understand what will be transpiring in the following pages you must read, included are these feelings; sorrow, guilt, romance, pain, joy, and anger. Many feelings will surface and it’s up to your soul, your personality to understand the experiences that are about to take place as your read. So knowing this, please enjoy. 589 Words Chapter 1: Naomi Kalani  Spoiler We start our story with a young female of Hawaiian ancestry. Though from the norm, she looks nothing like a Hawaiian—tall with beautiful bronze skin and an hour-glass figure, and her limbs fitting her body, not too long or too short. Her full head of coal-colored hair drapes past her hips, and her eyes, the color of glass, with a hint of blue to them, almost teal. But if you look at them, they can send shivers down your spine, as if you’re gazing at something that is too unrealistic to be real. But she’s not mean, or aggressive, instead shy and does not talk much even though she has the voice of an angel and a laugh that anyone can take joy from. Then again, she’s an outcast from society, and her school, and that’s because she looks so different and because of the unpleasantness you would get if you got too close. She herself cannot even explain this unpleasantness; it is an aura that makes willing people not wanting to get close. Could it be her cold eyes or her unrealistic looks? Little bit of both, but mainly the aura. Then again, her fashion sense too… She’s even more of an outcast to her peers because of the way she dresses. With clothing from another century, she wears dresses decorated with lace around the hem and sleeves, being very feminine and staying away from the tom-boy trends of her schoolmates. Our story begins with Naomi Kalani, a seventeen year old girl whom lives with her grandmother. Now, two weeks before she starts junior year at high school, she receives a phone call from her Uncle who has asked her to bring his ailing mother—her grandmother—back to the States, and saying that he will pay the expenses, as well as grant her to stay with them and go to school there, for back in Hawaii, she will have no relatives left to live with. Thinking this over to herself over the next week, she gladly accepts, thinking that being with the family would be the wisest decision. “I am an outcast here, anyway,” she told herself just before dialing them up again and saying she would come. “Naomi, I have a request I want you to do first. This is for your grandmother. I want you to take her to a location that my daughter will escort you to once you have arrived,” the Uncle tells her and she accepts the request. With a week left, she packs up and after a short dispute between her grandmother, she finds no way of getting her off the island, yet finds her grandmother’s Alzheimer to be of use. Being kind about it, she tricks her grandmother, and they board a plane the designated plane that is headed for the States. But here, on the plane, is where everything begins—a soul crying on deaf ears, longing to be heard by one such girl that has yet to know her true identity. We find this soul entering the girl’s dreams, trying to grow, trying to be heard just enough for the girl to take note of its existence. We must ask ourselves this: How long has this soul been trying to accomplish this? Trying to be heard and trying to be noticed? How long must this soul cry? Will it ever be heard? The scene began out of focus at first, moving every which way, erratically, but not smoothly, as if the scene was popping up from one place to the next. With gold sparks around the images, the scene slowly began to focus, smoothly changing its colors from the shades of gray to shades of red, yellow, and blue. The image then froze in place, stopping its erratic movement and now I can see the image clearly, like a movie. A bluff of limestone outcropping a small lake, that is longer than it is wide, but I can only see that from a distances and off to the right, but what I am guessing I am meant to see is the couple sitting on a bench near a large rock that is sitting vertical, and that looks as if you can just poke it and the boulder will tumble off the ledge it sits upon. The couple is young and dressed in 40’s clothing, but then it looks as if time is passing, the small trees that were once around them start growing and as they grow, I see the girl remain sitting, and the man disappears for a time, only to come walking in to sit next to the girl on the bench. It looks as if at least twenty years have passed and the bench disappears and I see a wedding between them. The girl dressed with a beautifully long pink dress and the male in a handsome tux. At that moment, I felt as if something was trying to make me think, trying to show me something, but the feeling soon fades as well with the scene and time passes once again. As I watch the years past between the couple, I soon begin to feel sorry for them, watching both age so quickly. Kids enter and a realization comes over me. Two kids, a male and female. I try to say something to the female, not knowing why but my voice is not heard and as I watch the kids getting older with their parents, I keep on calling out to the female wanting her to hear me, a lonesomeness building inside of me, but my voice is never heard. And just as soon as the kids appear, they vanish from the now old couple. With the trees looking to be fully grown, things start to slow down; longer periods are between each transition, until finally, I see the daughter of the two kids that were there before, entering; no man shows this time. Slowly but surely the silence that was engulfing me fades out and I hear the two women, the older one hunched over crying on her daughter’s shoulder. Then in a blink of an eye, everything vanishes, all is gone, I do not know how I knew they were my family although that might be the reason I tried calling out to the girl, she was my mother. A jerk shakes me from my slumber and I open my eyes to the crowded but silent cabin of an airplane. Turning my head this way and that I stop, staring at the bug eyed kid in front of me. Smiling, I hold out my hand and tilt my head saying in my friendly voice, “Hi, what is your name? I am Naomi.” “Naomi, you’re crying.” He laughs, but I see a hand tap him on the shoulder and his mom tells him that he is being impolite. “Sorry I was watching you,” He sighs and turns back in his seat, obeying his mother. Bringing a hand up to my cheek I feel the tears that the boy mentioned. Was I really just crying? What a strange dream, I think to myself as I dry my cheeks with the palms of my hands. Shaking my head to clear my thoughts I look down to my grandmother sitting at my side. She lets out one of her snores and a smile comes to my face as I think to myself that I did the right thing by bringing her back to the States where she grew up. Uncle Mike will be happy to see his mother again after so long. What has it been, ten years at least? Ten years since he saw me as well, I wonder what he will think of me all grown up. Opening the window shade, I watch the sun dawning. Resting my chin on the back of my hand I remain watching the sun, thinking of the meeting that will soon take place between all of us. After so long, I wonder how my cousins are. I think their names are Fate and Hope if I remember that correctly. I am sure they will be glad to see me. Pausing from my thoughts, I see two female faces in my mind, both with white hair and both identical. That is right, they are identical twins, and they must look really pretty now, being my age as well. Wonder if I am taller than them? I hope not. I am already a giant compared to the women and my classmates on Hawaii. Another snore erupts from my grandmother and I let out a laugh, something which is hardly heard because I am shy and my voice is very soft. Blushing I look away from the window and down at my lap, clenching the hem of my skirt I ask myself the one question that I’ve been worried about since leaving… 1,481 Words Chapter 2: Fate and Hope Elmore  Spoiler The cry was not heard—Naomi passed off what had happen to her while in her dreams as a simple illusion, though crying at the sight when she woke she remained awake as she watched as the plane descended and as the polite told them to fasten their seat belts, for they would soon be arriving at the airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There, a girl by the name of Fate Elmore waited for Naomi’s arrival. Being requested to by her father, she waits patiently, watching those that flew the flight her cousin is on to leave. Although being patient is not her usual characteristics, mainly because of her identical twin, Hope. Born by their mother Isabella, she gave them special names, Hope, because a few weeks after birth, found that she was blind. She had hoped that her sister, Fate, would be kind to her blind sibling, and help her as a sister. Because of her parents wishes—which she was rebellious at first, and not liking her sibling because she got more attention. But, she grew accustom to this and she slowly began to accept her sister, nearing her tenth year they were best friends—inseparable. Fate is a small girl, about five foot, and her shoulder length white hair is envied by most other girls. Large sea colored eyes; she usually has her brows knit because she is normally serious and laughs only when she herself finds something funny—which is rare. And although she may look feminine by her light skin tone and thin structure, as well as her wardrobe of dresses and skirts—she is very deceiving and between her and her sister she is the brute. They wear the same clothing, sometimes confusing people unfamiliar with them. As well as doing it on purpose, to get out of stuff one disliked. But there is one thing that is different from Hope and her, Hope wears her cloths without jeans pants, liking looser fitting clothing so she doesn’t have to bother with tripping while getting dress because of being blind. Six years have passed since then and in a way, that have both grown the same amount and look exactly the same, so switching who they are is done with great ease. Sitting back, Fate sighs to herself as she watches an old couple pass. Half asleep from staying up most of the night at practice, she shakes her head, trying to rid herself of her tiredness. Large headphones on, and some rock tunes playing, she spots an old woman and a tall girl walking through security. Recognizing them, or at least the old woman as her grandmother, she smiles and stands, picking up the sign that she had written her cousin’s last name on, hopping this would attract them from the crowed. The tall girl looks her way and they meet each other gazes. Something about her doesn’t seem right, Fate thought to herself, watching as the girl came closer and closer to her, escorting their grandmother. Fate fakes a smile, and hugs Naomi, congratulating her on her safe trip from Hawaii. Though Naomi stumbles on her name, accusing her of being Hope at first, Fate corrects her. Hugging her grandmother as well, they walk through the airport and into the streets, where a cab awaited them, arraigned by Fate’s father to drive them to Devil’s Lake—a very special place to their grandmother. When they arrive after the two hour drive, will their dear grandmother recognize the place? Their grandmother does not recognize were they are going. She is confused as to why they are stuffed in a cab and going to a location that Fate has yet to tell them. Their grandmother was persistent and because of her Alzheimer she began repeating herself. The cab driver even said something but they couldn’t get her to stop. After the drive, their grandmother finally settled down and she began acting as if she was being lead by something. Fate and Naomi have never been there and after tipping the cab they found themselves alone and their grandmother gone. She had run off. She climbed the rocky trail, surrounded by rocks and she soon found herself at that place, the place that she remember from so long ago despite the Alzheimer. She found the bench she sat at with him and she smiled out over the land, and the lake below. She was high on the trails that were created by glaciers many thousands of years ago. Taking many paths they past many hikers, all of whom were friendly and one party even told them that they saw a woman, but she wasn’t old and although she matched the wardrobe they were confused as to why she looked young and not old. Fate then had a thought. She’s this way because of her memories. She is remembering when she was most happy and that must be why she looks young and others are seeing this. Telling her idea to Naomi, she agrees for she heard the same from her parents long ago. They continue on the path even though night was falling. Both tired, they stumbled along the rugged path until they came upon their grandmother. “Morgan…” Their grandmother spoke as a ghostly figure appeared. He’s dressed in his old army uniform. Fate looks to Naomi, hoping to learn something that might help this situation make more senses but all she finds is tears. Naomi is crying, her mouth hanging ajar. Then she speaks and a lot more becomes clear. “This place…this is where grandmother meant grandfather.” Their grandmother and the ghostly figure embrace each other, her tears spilling down her cheeks. But the image of the young grandmother soon vanishes. Her back becomes hunched, and her hair change color and becomes gray and long instead of curly and short—the color of the darkest night. She lets out a scream as the ghostly figure of their handsome young grandfather vanishes and their grandmother drops to the ground. But from the moment that their grandmother’s body hit the ground a light flashes, blinding both Fate and Naomi. Fate wakes hours later to find that she is leaning against one of the many pines in the forest that surrounds them, but she also sees that ambulances have come and that her Uncle had also arrived, but he was not tended to her, he was trying to snap Naomi out of the daze that she was in, she was kneeling and gazing at the stars above, as if praying she talked in a whisper but no words were understandable and her eyes were red from crying the whole time. Looking up at the flashing lights I see a silhouette trying to help me up, her hand is outstretched and as I take her hand, my sister says with some sorrow in her voice that grandmother had died. 1,149 Words Look forward to more, I promise to work on this one more frequently then I did with Luna or Venus.

 Hmm, I think I read this somewhere before. I'm sure of it that I read it from an older post of yours, MoSteel, despite it being from quite a while ago. It's very interesting starting out with female characters instead of the usual male. I like this. 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.

Naomi Marie Norna ...that's all I can think of atm. My males main characters are: Marcus Jack Rupert Zed'Cal Anyway it's kind of even for now...I'm sure I'm missing some.

 Chapter 3: Dave and Phil Domina  Spoiler The flash of light and the images that Fate saw were real, something known to very few. The Death Flash and Light Image. Though rare for a Death Flash to happen, it just represents when the soul has left the body and goes to either Heaven or Hell. As for the Light Image, otherwise known as Happy Times, this is an image that reveals itself when someone is about to die. It shows their happiest moment in life and very few can actually make senses of it such as the hikers, they saw a young female passing them. They took it as is. But that will be explained in detail later, and Naomi saw the same, only she received something extra. Something I can’t see, or explain, but I know it’s a threat. Now, let us rewind the clock back to five hours, back to before Naomi and Fate’s grandmother died, and back to the place that Naomi will be staying. The small town of Dousman, Wisconsin, a sleeper community where most it’s population leave the humble town to go to work, then to return home and spend their nights with their families. This will be her new home, but what we find there are two boys, around the same age of Fate and Naomi, who are now in a park in the middle of the small town arguing. The first boy and the smaller of the two is Dave Domina. Standing at a height of five six, his body seems to be small, but he has long arms and legs. Referred to as the monkey of the school, he’s energetic and short tempered, easily getting into unnecessary fights. With thick black hair that’s noticeably uncombed and brown eyes, he tends to be more of a loner, relying on others to help him where he is weakest, such as school work and being stubborn. But this is where the other boy comes in. Being almost five ten, he is perfect proportions, yet he’s younger. Phil Domina, with large blue eyes hiding behind thickly yet fashionably black framed glasses he is more of a nerd, so to say. Usually wearing a tie and nice clothing he’s not very talkative to his peers at his school and tends to stay quiet, but when he’s on a roll with making an argument or with friends, he’s talking the most. He is the brains of the group. Out of the two, they are noting like each other, yet they make each other whole, one making sense of the others stupidity while the other fights the batters that the other cannot win with intelligent alone. For Phil to have such an irrational brother, it does put a bit of stress on him, he acts more like the older brother then anything, and Dave, just a toddler. Phil supports them for the most part, living with a friend of their parents, they seem to get along with her fine, but Dave gets awfully mad at her, for numerous different reasons, and when that happens, Phil needs to always calm him down before he returns. As for the current situation, it seems that Dave has found himself a nice bench in the park to sit on while he vents his anger. As he watches the clouds in the sky, his mind is only on the fact that he cannot seem to get what he wants and that he is mad at another that says at the same home he says at. Fate. Sighing he turns around on the bench to see Phil, and he knows he is in the wrong once again. Phil has come to talk some senses into him like he has always done over the years since their parents decided to go traveling around the world, only sending postcards every few weeks. But being himself, Dave will try his hardest to argue against his brother. Taking my eyes off the ground I stare at the sky, and the sun that soon will be setting. Sitting back I rest my arms on the backrest of the bench, but I turn my head slightly so I can see behind me. Coming from around one of the many buildings in the park, I spot my brother, Phil. I decide to speak up before he could and sounding cocky as well, “So, Philly, you going to tell me the same thing?” Stopping besides the bench he remains standing and adjusts his glasses with his pointer and ring-finger, pressing slightly on the center of the glasses. “I really wish you wouldn’t call me Philly, I’m not a food you know.” A smile comes to my face, and he smiles as well, “so, how pissed off do you think I got the old hag this time?” “Well, knowing the Mistress and the topic matter, I believe that she is more furious at you now than ever. You’re not that wise in picking your battles, are you?” He ends his comment, leaving sourness in the air. “She can burn in hell, that’s what I think of her.” Phil smacks his head, then removing his hand he shakes his finger side to side and looks directly at me. “Do you know what the Mistress is picking Fate?” “She’s an old hag?” I say, jokingly but with more seriousness then I knew Phil wanted to hear. “Dave, I feel sorry for you, you’re strong, but you just don’t understand the simplest of things. The Mistress is choosing Fate from you because she is reliable, she can do things without taking them too far, and she is serious about her tasks. You, you on the other hand are childish, you almost destroyed the house last year, and you couldn’t control yourself.” He pauses, trying to control his frustration with me. “Phil, I’m telling you to shut it.” I reply, louder than him, but he continues on. “You never think before you do things, do you Dave?” He says, looking into my furious eyes, both of us now furious at one another. “I’m telling you, just let this go. You can’t do anything about it.” I stand and the instance I do, Phil takes a step back, but holds his ground, knowing what is coming next. Stepping forward I swing my fist, but he easily dodges it and knowing that is what he’ll do I swing my other arm. Contact with his stomach and he coughs from the blow. He takes a few steps back as I keep advancing. “Don’t you see Dave, this is exactly—” he pauses to see where I went. It’s as if in a flash I disappeared, but as he was talking he blinked and missed me sidestepping to his right. Jumping at him before he even noticed me we both fall to the ground, rolling around and yelling at one another and getting out cloths dirty. Although we do stop when I hear a familiar voice, but that’s not before Phil give me a great sucker punch to the cheek, my lower lip now bleeding. “You two, I swear you can never get along.” Hope comments as she walks from around the playground. Reveling herself, but she isn’t the only one who has been watching. A tall man, dress similarly to Phil walks out with Hope, “Come on boys, is Mary’s decision really bothering you that much, Dave?” Dusting myself off and tripping Phil as he tries to stand I state my answer plainly. “Yes.” “You’re just stubborn.” Phil says as he finally stands and stepping away from me, adjusting his glasses again. “I’m telling you this now, you can’t change her decision, she’s scary, and you know that.” “That’s why I call her an old hag instead of Mistress all the time, Mike. We’re flesh and blood yet she won—” Mike cuts me off holding a hand up to stop me. “Hope, boys, we need to get going, something’s up.” Mike says, his eyes darting every which way as he tries to pin point the feeling he’s getting and when he finally does his eyes widen and he grabs a hold of Hope arm and she lets out a gasp as if startled but follows the hand that is leading her. They starts walking in a fast pace around the playground and towards his car parked closely by. Not realizing it yet, but soon I can feel it, and although it’s so far away I can sense the slightest bit of energy. Looking over to Phil, he just follows Hope and Mike, his face showing signs of defeat, and even something else that I can’t place. Maybe it’s sadness? I follow as well and we all pack into his car, leaving for the place that Mike told us that Fate was going to. Devil’s Lake. Arriving at Devil’s Lake, we all pile out of the car, the energy that we were feeling before so strong that you feel as if you could puke, you’re so overwhelmed by it. My first comment is, “Do you think one has been born?” I say as Mike gets out of the car and starts running for the energy. I take off after him, living both Phil and Hope behind us. I hear Hope complain, saying “thanks” as we dash up the trail leading towards where Fate and Naomi are. While on the drive over Mike explained to us the situation. “No I don’t this energy is too pure, I don’t think one will show itself.” He replies back, running faster than I thought he ever could run. Mumbling at myself, kind of wishing a Shell would appear I keep on his tracks, following him even though the path is as rough as it is. As we ran for what see seems like an hour which was actually just half an hour up the path. We find the source, although I’m shocked to see a tall girl kneeling with her eyes wide open and staring at the sky. She has tears streaming down her face. But that isn’t Mike’s first thought; he sees another figure lying on the ground way from the girl who looks like she could be dead. “Dave, tell me you see Fate somewhere.” I hear Mike shout to me as he runs over to the crumpled figure lying on the ground. Looking around some, I see her leaning up against a tree. “Yah, I see her.” I comment back, and see that Mike is on his cell. “Good, now go over to Naomi and see if you can snap her out of it, the longer she’s in the trance the less willing she be able to come back.” “What?” I reply, dumbfounded. “Just slap her face a few times, she’ll end up going limp. Then you’ll know she’s out of the trance.” He points to her once again and then starts talking on the phone. And from the sound of things, I think he just called 911. I go to Naomi who’s still kneeling and staring at the sky. Bending over I stare into her eyes for a moment. She really is beautiful I think to myself, seeing her in full view now, and much better then what I imaged. Shaking my head, I put a hand on one cheek and the other on her opposite and I begin to shake her face, but nothing happens. I hear something in the bushes behind me but then I hear Phil say something, but not paying much attention when Mike cuts in, still on his phone, “Dave, I said slap.” I continue to shake her a bit more furiously—I’m not going to slap a girl—and soon enough Naomi falls limp and I catch her. Standing with her now in my arms I turn to see that the sun has already set and quite a few cars are now here. I also notice that Hope is with Fate near the tree that I saw her earlier. Sighing I walk forward, “Come on sleeping beauty, time to get you to wake up.” “A bit corny don’t you think,” My brother tells me with a smile now. Knitting my brows I walk back toward Mike and Phil follows. 2,037 Words Well one more chapter then I will be beginning the actual writing of new chapters instead of editing the old. Still there is more editing to do even in these first few chapter. Who knows what to come with my writing, it's been a year or so, I'm way more fluent but I still see these first few chapters that I did as better then what I can do now, no idea why though. Maybe it's the narrative at the beginning. It gets me into a flow and I continue off of that. Thanking a video, was nice to listen to as I edited the third chapter.

 This one is COOL. 
 The Phantomhive Household <3 
 Chapter 4: A Silhouette  Spoiler In the emptiness of a white universe a single white figure with a black outline sat cross-legged, deep in thoughther soul struggling to remain whole. Trying to fight what will consumer her. Yet her spirit is now so out of touched that she will never be herself again. Yet she tries in vain to keep together. She will have no sense once she changes, no matter how much she struggles. We should feel sorry for her, for she may not be able to make tell her the message. What is her message then, what are her thoughts? This message, will she understand it? She must understand my message! She must know that her life is threatened. If I can just make her understand my message shell be better off, shell be able to protect herself. I only hope she can understand it before I drift into the emptiness that seems so close now that if I even lose focus for a second, it will grasp me. She must understand, before I disappear from this single thread of life that Im still clinging to. I want to cry to her, I want her to understand Well she receive this message, well she comprehended the meaning? That is up to Naomi, and Naomi herself. I was crying before it happened, but when the flash came, I instantly stopped. The sound of the blinding light was like that of a coming storm. All I could do was staring in awe as the light surrounded me, I spun around to watch my surrounds of the park vanish, and soon, the noise stopped. Silence filled the air and an eerie feeling washed over me as I looked for some signs of color in this bleakness. Nothing, nothing at all. Looking around me, I saw nothing but the light or is it light, everything is bleached, am I even seeing light? I do not know if I was consumed by it or not, all I knew is my previous surrounds were gone. Everything and everywhere a solid color of whiteso blinding it hurts. A small chuckle sounds from behind me. A familiar one toowho it belongs to I do not know though. Turning on the spot my first reaction is to run, but I cannot, I am too shocked by what I turn to see. In front of me sits alone figurea silhouette in this bleakness. A white silhouette outlined by a blotchy black outline, barely revealing its human shape. I try to form words, too stunned to form worlds, yet I manage to say who? Smiling, the chuckle comes again. The thought that I have heard that laugh somewhere pops in my head again. One leg down as if sitting cross-legged the other up, its elbow resting on its knee. It points to me with its smile. Each tooth showing itself in detail, almost as if I were looking through a telescope at them. An eerie toothy grin was smiling back at me, and I felt like running, I wish I could but my feet do not seem to want me to move. Hear me. The silhouettes voice echoes around the bleakness. Flinching at her voicean obvious females voiceI take a step back. The silhouette sees my reaction and stands, then stepping forward, as if pleading with me. The figure doesnt seem so threatening now, and by her grin alone I sense of sadness. I am terrified by this, but the figure is showing body movements that one would show if they were trying to make you understand something and you wont buy it. Please, Rose. The silhouette calls to me, I must help you. Finding this thing less hostile, and less frightening than when I first saw her, I smile, deciding to be kind myself something tells me I must be kind, I am kind in the first place, why am I spooked by this. I do not know what she, or it or whatever this is, this world, this figure My name is Naomi, not Rose. I mutter, barely audible even to myself, but the figure hears. The pleading silhouettes shoulders shrink as I spoke my words. Then the silhouette stands up straight again, as if realizing something. And so suddenly had the silhouette done so, that an invisible force knocks me to my knees. My ears filled with static, I heard nothing but static. My hands reaching for my ears, as the sound of the static becomes too great, my eyes close and I feel an incredible pain in the back of my head. Like a sledge hammer to the back of the head. My head pounds and I want to scream. I think I did scream even. But soon I feel a warming sensation, and upon looking up, I stare into the face of the silhouette, still with just the outline of a smile. Placing a hand on my shoulder she opens her mouth. The rose She says, her words trailing off. Handing me a rose, I feel a cold sweat covering my body, my breathing is ragged from the pain that I have just felt, yet here and now there is no pain, and the static is gone. The rose, the silhouette repeats again, as if beckoning to me to take the blue rose thats in front of me. My mind still spinning, I stare at that rose for the longest time. Hearing a few splashes of water hit the endless white that I feel as if I am floating on, yet still solid. The silhouette leans towards me, bringing the rose closer to my face. The pain and static soon returns. My mind blanks out for a bit as all the focus is on the pain, I cover my ears and pant. Even more sweat rising to my skin then falling to the ground. I do not get this I cant understand this, what is going on? I say, pain in my voice as I speak each word. I let out a small scream as the pain intensifies. Just, end this, what ever you are! Listen to the rose, hear it, and take it. The silhouette calmly tells me, through the static and pain. Reaching out a shaking hand, I take the rose as she commanded me to, yet upon taking it, I prick myself on the stem and drop the rose to the ground. The rose disappears before it lands as if it never was there to begin with. Starting at my left hand with blood surfacing on my forefinger, I gaze back at the silhouette. She just smiles back at me, with a small laugh and then the silhouette blows away with an invisible wind. Remember the rose. I hear as the remaining dust of her body blows away. Upon pricking her finger, the figure vanished, using what she could to give the message. But, since she used too much of her soul, she is now nearly there to becoming what she was struggling to avoid. She can no longer contain herself and thus has fallen. While the blood wells on Naomis finger a little longer, it soon falls to the ground. Distorting the bleakness and making the woods of Devils Lake reappear. But she remains staring at the havens, her body never moving while in the physical world, she prayed, she does not know why, she never was very spiritual but her body instantly knew she needed to pray, pray for the lost soul even if it was not her grandmother she was talking to. A lost soul that well never be able to ascend or descend. 1,277 Words Well, this is the last chapter. Now in over 3 or 2 years, the first new chapter. I remember the ending for this story and some other parts but as of now everything is a crap shot, so I hope I get my main goal down with how I first thought out this story. I know I will, I have a great memory. I'll try posting a new chapter within the next few days.

 Chapter 5: Hidden Potential  Spoiler The ride back to the mansion was uneventful, no one in the vehicle truly knew what happened, and if he did he is not speaking. They all lost someone they loved, saved for Fate and Hope. Dave and Phil, their grandmother had died and Mike, his mother. All that is left is Naomi. Before she was in tears, now she is strangely calm, staring at her forefinger with just a sliver of light coming from the waning moon. A two hour ride back home and an hour passed, it is already close to midnight and the group has school the following morning. The mistress is not going to be happy with them. Elegant is one word to describe her. Old, another, and furthermore, strict. No one knows much about the old mistress by the name of Mary. She resides over an orphanage thats older then her but changed the mansion to that of an inn. With the town being young, she was able to help make Dousman furious. Mike came in around this time, volunteering at the mansion and helping out Mary and her maids, one of them being his deceased wife. His sister came in around this time as well, wanting to follow her older brotherNaomis mother. She was kind back then, thats for sure. But she always kept things strict and soon her kindness faded, she became dull and showed very few emotions. This became apparent soon after Naomis mother moved to Hawaii to merry her husband. Their mother followed, wanting to be warm in her old age. Mary had grown attracted to the old women that she had know over the years while she herself raised kids that Mary could never have. This leaves us with Mary as she is now. Dull and emotionless, but still training a new generation in how to deal with Shells and the regrets that lingers behind after one has passed if any. Although I had received a call from Mike telling me they would be late because his mother had died, I remain vigilant. The hours passing, more than four hours go by as I wait on the front porch of my mansion with cane resting beneath both my palm just below my abdomen. A death is no excuse to be late. I want them home so I can test Naomi, so I can see if she has inherited her mothers will or if I am needed to trainer her to gain one of her own. Biting my lower lip I see headlights coming down the driveway. Releasing my strain I remain stern, watching as the red van pulls around to the front of the steps. The side door opens first; Fate, Hope, and Dave appear. Fate looks exhausted though, I can see it in her gaze, shes been using too much of her will to try and understand what happened. I will have to speak to Mike further about this. But they all remain like perfect soldiers, standing tall in front of me, knowing I am furious at all of them. Mike leaves the driver side, obvious sad, but hiding it. And soon I see Phil coming out of the back seat, a helping hand to our new arrival, Naomi who does not want to move. I see her; shes staring at her hand. She has gotten a message. Phil, dont coddle the girl, let her get out of the vehicle on her own. I tell Phil who hesitates, but backs off. All of them standing in a line, facing with the same stern look I have as I wait for Naomi to leave the protective shell. I hear the grandfather clock strike one and what sympathy I had for the poor girl leave me. Dave, grab her and bring her to the court yardHope I do not have to say anything more as Hope walks up the stairs past me, heading in side. She knows I want her to test Naomi. Dave makes no attempt to talk back like he usually does; he was in the wrong earlier when I told him I would be picking Fate to take over my job when I die. Old hag this and old hag that. Hes nothing but a toddler still teething. Naomi makes little sound as Dave gets an arm around her waist, pulling her out of the vehicle and swinging her over his shoulder, he walks toward me, Fate, Mike and Phil following. Leaving me on the porch alone, a calm wind blows, loosening my bun a bit. I am not as young as I use to be, these brittle hands cannot tie a bun like they used to. Snorting, forgetting those shallow thoughts I turn and walk back into my home ready to grade Naomis will. These halls are silent as I walk the path I have walked many times before to the courtyard. An enclosed grassy area of which my home is centered and of where my students attend to their practices. The lack of light illumining the hall coming from the courtyard does not deter me. I must see if she has a will. Heavy steps stop me, halting me from entering the courtyard and the worried face of Mike. Please Mistress, its late, they need their sleep. That is none of my concern. I brush him off trying to move pass him, and he remains still. I can no longer punish you like I can the studentsbut I still have fight in me, you know you wont last long, so move! I tell him quietly. He steps aside, knowing my words ring true. The courtyard is calm as I take my usual stances on the border, a spot I have stood in for so long and so often that the grass has died. In the center stands Hope and still sitting like some scared girl, Naomi. I get the feeling Dave could not even stand her up but no matter, I will be able to see what I want. Dave, Phil, Fate, and Mike all line up next to me, as if they are waiting to get in this fight as well, but they are not, they know this is purely an observational fight, they hope they can learn something from it, even if they are dead tired. They know my word is rule around here. Not caring to go over everything, I tell Hope briefly Do not hold back. Begin. It is as if Naomi does not even know what is going on. In a flash Hope has straighten herself up and her will has washed over her. Like an outline of white her clothing begins to shine and change and in mare seconds she is in a black maids outfit. Her skirt cut short so she can run; there are garters around both legs which contain her weapon of choice when fighting a Shell. Throwing knifes. She is able to use them in close range as well but because she is blind she prefers the distances. She has incredible hear that even I am impressed by. Taking a step back, in a swift movement with her arms she already has four throwing knifes in each hand and her arms are crisscrossed in front of her. She is eyeing her target who remains still, she has no idea what is going on and I am not about to let her regain her sense. This is perfect for seeing her natural reflexes. There is no movement as Hope throws her knifes, one second they are in her hands, the next they are not. Another second later I watch them appear in front of Naomis face. She turns as if hearing something. The throwing knifes soar right past her, landing in the grassnever making a sound. Everyone is showing an expressing of awe, but not me. She heard something that snapped her out her trances, now, she is in a panic, she does not know where she is at or what is going on, like she was at one place and suddenly appears at another. I was right, there was a message. Continue. She is with us now. I tell Hope who gives me a glance before vanishing in front of Naomi who is now too stunned to talk. Hope appears behind Naomi who rolls in an instant as Hope brings down a kick. Hope never goes for melee unless she is unable to go for range. Did she figure that out so quickly? Hope continues her kicks, and Naomi continues to roll, yelling all the while. Asking what is going on? How did she get here? And all sorts of stuff, but she has yet to realize she is suppose to be on the offensive, fighting Hope. Dave, I say as we continue to watch, Naomi just dodging while Hope continues to kick, she begins throwing knifes into the mix as well but Naomi is incredibly agile. She has great instant and I can sense a familiar will. Let us see if I cannot provoke that a bit. Get in there, as I told Hope, do not hold back. He is hesitant, and I give him my furious glare, the one I gave him last year when he practical destroyed my home. I watch his adams apple dip as he jumps into the middle of the sprawl. Hope is not fazed, but Naomi lets out a yelp as Dave goes after her. He had decided not to go with any type of shadows such as Hopes maid outfit for he thought it looked wrong on him and I hate to agree with my students, but a midget buff guy in a butlers outfit such as Mike had did look ridicules on him. On the other hand Phil accepted it with open arms though he has no will he loves to wait that tux. Bringing down fist after fist, and Hope with a mix of throwing knifes and kicks, they continually try to force Naomi into a stalemate but her dodging just will not stop. I see a smile coming to her face and she speaks, I was in both gymnastics and track Reaching out my right hand, I stop Naomi in her tracks; I have never gone so far as to stop such childs play. I have had enough; I want to see her will. Mistress, I hear Mike call to me and I watch as both Hope and Dave stop, now watching Naomi who is struggling in mid air against an invisible force. Continuing I say nothing as I allow my restraint on her close on her. Show me, do you have a strong will. Her eyes begin to widen, but not because of my restraint, shes is revealing her will nowit dawns on me that she is able to dodge stuff so easily, not because of track or gymnastics, but because she has her mothers eyes. That of a marksman Letting out a long held breath I release her and she topples to the ground, coughing. Hope and Dave remain where they are while Fate, Phil, and Mike all watch me for a moment before I wave at them, turning on my heels and leaving. I have seen what I wanted; she has her mothers will, an inheritance. I have dealt with that before and doing so again will be a walk in the park. Cautiously revealing a smile I head for my bedroom, I am tired as well. Growing old is not fun. 1,921 Words Great chapter if I do say so myself.

My writing is heavy based off of manga, so I'm glad others see that, and even though I'd love to see this as a manga my art work is poor but my writing is good so you see my reasoning. Either way I'm glad you like it.

 Chapter 6: False Pretenses  Spoiler She had thought she heard a voice telling her she is in danger. She had snapped out of her trance from message that the lone soul had given her. The soul doubts she comprehended the message but she wanted to help one last time. If it were not for her she would have been seriously injured. The soul is no longer a soul now, but a Shell. To be honest Naomi did not understand anything going on, and when she was well enough to stand the only one left to help her to her room was Phil. Phil remained quiet though, giving a nod here and there, yet never answering any of her questions. When they reached her room he said a final good night and left. She did not sleep a wink that night, it was already two in the morning and her mind was going a hundred miles an hour. She knows her grandmother is dead, she is sad because of that, yet happy at the same time, she was going to spend eternity her loving husband. That was on her mind but did not trouble her as much as her Uncle Mike tell her that coming up here was for her grandmothers sake. She sees it now as much for her as it is was for her grandmother. Sure, who would not want to see their mother, she thought, but at the same time, I was brought here to be trainedwould be the word by an old woman I never knew of. What could she do? She cannot do anything. She will be here to train, she will be taught by the Mistress to be able to protect people from Shells. Shells go after loved ones first and expanding form there to cousins and half siblings and so on. Killing them, yet leaving no traces of a body. Only a name of a faceless being is left. Only those who remember them will ever know the faceless beings left by the Shells. It is sad but that is the truth. Naomi is here to train so that these things never happen, if a person is to die it should be because of old age. Some die of disease or murders but it all ties back to regret. They want to help, they want to feel as if they are helping even if that turns out bad. All of it. Regret. The sun rising Naomi watches out the window with bags under her eyes. She has come to no other conclusions but one and that is uncle Mike did not fill her in on what would be going on if she came. She knows now, but partially Will she go through with it? She must. It is her only way to figure out the message she has received from the silhouette. A knock at her door sways her, as she backs away from the window. Turning she answers her door with a quiet Who is it. May I come in, is the reply I get back. His voice just as quiet as mine, but there is an emotion to it I cannot pick up. I do not reply, rather I open the door to allow my uncle in. He does not enter, but hangs in the threshold as he looks me over only to say that I look horrible. Thanks. Hesitant to say anything more I ask if thats all but he shakes his head. Im sorry, he lets out after a long silence. I should have told you I was bringing you here to train. I am not one for confrontation but what happened last night is beyond words. I do not understand any of it. And my uncle can see that on my face, his sea blue eyes piercing me behind his frames. He and that one person looks alikeI do not think I ever got his name, or that other onethey must be his sons because they look so much alike. I can tell youre flustered. Comments as he now looks beyond me, not wanting to have my gaze on him, he knows he has disappointed me by lying. Youre here now, so my question is what will you do? Stay or I can send you home. It looked like you were having fun last night. Knitting my brow and looking at the scarlet carpeting of my room I frown, that is not who I am, I was caught in the moment. I had no idea what was going on, I was scared, but after I began dodging thoseattacks I felt energetic even after everything You take after your mother, he cuts in, a smile on his face at mentioning his sister. Although you look more like your dad, you took on more of his personality now that youve grown. I havent seen you in years; when you were young you had the same personality as your mother. And what I saw last nightearlier this morning he says rubbing the back of his head. You are just like your mother deep down. Letting out a shy laugh I can tell the mood has lightened, but I am still drained and dead tired. Wobbling on my feet, my uncle puts an arm out, catching me as I fall forward. Im barely awake. Im going to hold off the mistress for you, Id like you to head to school but I doubt youll be functioning. Take it easy today, stay here and get some sleep. Lets hope tomorrow you can head to school though. Nodding I cannot keep my eyes open long enough to reply. I am lead to my bed is all I know and soon I enter a deep sleep from which I do not wake for hours. When I do wake it is already evening, around eight o clock. I have slept the whole day. But now I am wide awake. Leaving the comforts of my bed I have a good look around my room. The bed with a canopy and a small desk in the corner for school work once I finally get some. The dressers are built into the bed frame and my suitcases have been placed next to the large eight foot tall door that leads into my room. This room is surprisingly tall, but small at the same time with two large windows on the other side of my bed which is placed with the headboard against the opposite wall of the desk. Long thick cloth curtains cover the two windows from any light that may enter. With varnished wood all around, this room seems like it would fit in a castleI cannot remember getting to my room last night, I just remember the fight with Fate and some other guy A knock comes at my door and a males voice breathers through the door. It is not that of my uncle so it must be one of those two guys. Naomi, you awake yet? Shuttering, I do not know who this person is but I answer him finally after walking to the door, who are you. Oh, says the man behind the door quite quickly, I didnt realize we were never introduced. I am Phil, your uncles son. The other, the one that was throwing punches at you last night if you remember. Hes Dave, my brother. Hes not so kind so I will introduce him to you. Going for the doorknob I open the door just a sliver so I can see into the dim lighted hall and see this man. I was right; he looks like a younger version of my uncle. This is Phil. He seems nice at least. I do not remember him ever talking. He catches a glimpse of me as I watch him through the sliver, he smiles towards me and I shy away, closing the door. His chuckle is muffled but he knocks again. I cant imagine you will be sleeping anytime soon so why not come out and Ill show you around. My dad told me it would be a good idea while the others are training. Taking a deep breath to calm myself a scent drifts by my noise and I cringe. I smell. I have not taken a shower in two days Can you I am hesitant to ask him, I never need to ask something thisembarrassing to someone. but could you show me to the showers firstgive me a moment. Sure, he replies immediately. Once youre done Ill take you on a tour. Blushing still, I grab my suitcases from near the door, placing them on the bed I grab what I need, and carry them under my arm. Heading for the door I open it wide to reveal the man, he is just as tall as I am, if not taller. In a suit, he looks kind of funny but he just smiles at me. Shall we be going then? He asks, walking away, a cue for me to follow and I do. Sorry I smell. But realizing what I just said so calmly I blush again, hiding my face by looking at the trim on the walls as we walk together. For the first time he is a bit hesitant as well. Stutter he tells me it is in our nature to sweat. The awkward silence is broken by both of us laughing. For the first time while being here I feel I can at least trust this guy. He seems uptight but he is also as clueless as I amI think. He gives off that feeling. Everyone even Fate was standoffish. But Phil, he is different. As our laughter dies, we stop in front of a large door way, just like many of the other doors we have passed on the way here; this door is slightly different being that in the actual wood is an engraving of the word female. Nodding my thanks, and without anymore words I head inside. 1,666 Words Well, I thought I would have issues with this chapter, but I already know where to head with this instead of what I was thinking earlier. Look forward to the next.

 Chapter 7: What is Soul?  Spoiler The tour went as smoothly as Phil could expect. Once Naomi had left her shower and changed into some fresher smelling clothing Phil took her around the old orphanage. Dropping by the sick bay, moving on to many of the court yards, each still up kept because of everyone. Phil had leaned into Naomi who remained timid and told her that the Mistress works us to the bone when we do not have school work or anything else to do. Naomi’s only comment to this is that she does not like the Mistress all that much, Phil rebuked the statement with none of them do. The mistress knows none of them do and thus she keeps everyone on a tight leash. They move on, passing everyone’s room, Phil, Dave and uncle Mike, they all share one room which holds a bunked and a normal bed. The room is about as well furnished as Naomi’s, if not slightly better to hold the three males that live within the rustic orphanage. Naomi wants to question Phil but feels it is better to save her questions, she does not want to say anything that maybe offensive and after her smelling comment, she is hesitant to utter a peep. Rounding a corner, and nearing the end of the tour, they come face to face with Fate and Hope, both of them looking out of breath. Phil waves, saying hi but they both shrug it off, walking past them. Their footsteps on the wood floor fade when new ones enter, and the sound of a cane which makes Phil pause, waiting to see if the mistress will be coming around the corner… She does and she does not look all that pleased. The tour went as smoothly as could be expected up to that point. Her tiring eyes on both Naomi and Phil, Phil had already expected what the Mistress would say. Planting a hand on Naomi’s shoulder she jumps, and looks toward Phil who speaks. “My brother seems to have gone missing, I must go find him.” “That is correct, now go find him, tell him he gets the usual punishment.” The Mistress adds, her tone of voice revealing her anger toward the delinquent that Dave is. Phil leaves the scene, leaving Naomi with Mary and Mary was still frustrated over last night even though she was glad to see that Naomi did indeed have will. Their moment together was not long for Fate came back, less exhausted looking and a bottle of water in hand. Naomi remaining confused by Phil suddenly leaving, the person she has felt most comfortable with since coming, now gone. She remains quiet and the Mistress comes up to her, resting a hand on her back and guiding her to face Fate who looks a bit peeved. “You will be working with Fate until you gain your Soul Gear and Tools.” She tells the two calmly, but only Fate looks taken aback even though Naomi has no idea what is going on. “Mistress,” Fate bursts out, “She isn’t going to gain those so quickly, even I took four months to just get the gear, let along the extra two to gain the tools.” The Mistress remain stern, not buying into Fate’s plead. She has good reason to. Fate gained both her gear and tools at a remarkable young age, even sooner than her sisters. Of course she inherited her Soul Gear and Tools. Hope, she took two years longer, same with Dave. “Fate, it will be no time at all with Naomi, her personality is much more constructed. She is as she will be with only subtle differences in the years to come…now prove to me you were the right choice to take over my job once I am gone.” Fate shuts up immediately. Walking away before walking back and grabbing Naomi’s arm because she did not follow, they walk away from the Mistress who remains standing there for a short time before leaving herself. She is expecting great things from Naomi and she hopes to see the fruit of her hope in the morning for she is far to worn out to take on another few hours of the day to train Naomi herself. Tossing the water bottle down and letting go of Naomi’s arm, they now stand in the courtyard from the night before. The shining light from the moon even less then the night before begins casting shadows. I will wish it was a full moon, I could see so much easier. I turn on Naomi, staring up into her face. She remains quiet and a look of confusion plastered all over her face. It’s annoying to work with someone this clueless. “Thanks Mistress,” she tells herself. “Speak,” I tell her and she winces. “How spineless are you?” I add, after hearing nothing leave her mouth. “I am not spineless.” “Good, then we’ll begin.” She continues to look confused, “begin what?” She asks and I smack my forehead. “Were you not listing to the Mistress?” “Yes, but I did not understand what she was saying,” she tells me, a scared tone to her voice. “I do not know what is going on here, why do I need training, what does my personality have to do with any of this…Mike filled me in kind of but I do not…” “Be quiet would you.” I tell her and she looks as if she’s on the verge of tears. I would not expect this from the person yesterday, she greeted me fine off the plane, and she looked to be having fun dodge Hope and Dave yesterday. Well constructed my ass. “I am to help you gain your Soul Gear and Tools. First the gear since it is easier. “But…” “Remain quiet and watch me, I will explain in just a moment.” Stiffening myself as Naomi gives me her stupid look, I concentrate on my gear that I was chosen to have by the Mistress. The same maids outfit as my sisters, only with white pantyhose covering my legs. Naomi’s mouth drops as she watches my transformation and I frown at her. It really isn’t that surprising…then again she was out of it when Hope transformed yesterday night… Pointing at her, I tell her that it’s her turn. “You see, the Soul Gear protects us from anything as long as we continue to have the soul, rather the will to have it continuing to protect us. You remember my sister’s throwing knifes, Yuki?” “Yuki?” Giving her a stiff look, I continue. “I can protect myself from her Soul Tool with my Soul Gear…I can protect myself from a gun even with this, but we’re all still training so I rather not test that yet.” I add jokingly the last part but it falls flat. She’s really dense. “Anyway, I want you to concentrate on something happy…we’ll see if that triggers you’re Soul Gear or not.” She begins by tilting her head, her eyes darting all over the place, never resting on my, but she looks to be thinking, she really is awkward. “Okay, try this, think of your family, or friends, anything that you’re happy about.” Her act continues and while I wait for any signs of her gear showing up I hear steps behind us on the wooden walkway that outlines the courtyard. I can sense my sister. She comes to see how I am doing with getting Naomi…who has now been standing there quietly for an half hour trying to call forth her gear. “Any luck,” she asks, breaking Naomi’s concentration. Naomi looks around dazed and I have to quiet my sister. I want to move onto her Soul Tool because that’s easier to call forth then her gear, now that I think about it…but does she have a name yet? “Fate, may I try something?” My sister asks me and I’m impatient enough to let her have a go. “Fine, do whatever. I doubt Naomi even noticed our little chat besides in the beginning, she’s been facing away from me this whole time, thinking it would be better than watching me while trying to concentrate. I didn’t blame her, I’d even have a hard time if I was watching someone, but for me it’s so natural to call forth my gear it doesn’t even matter. Hope steps forward onto the lawn, bring her right arm up and her Soul Tools appearing, four of her throwing knifes. I’m about to tell her to stop when she’s already gone though with the swing. Switching tactics I yell out her name, and she spins on her heels. But I see the outline that I was waiting for, in seconds her Soul Gear is there, protecting her from the knifes my sister just threw. Only for a moment though before they vanish again. Her Soul Gear is stunning though, a color scheme of dark browns and pale yellows. But it was too quick to actually make out her outfit. I believe she had a skirt but I’m not even sure. Turning to my sister I give her the stink eye, and also cueing her to leave. She does, and when I turn back to Naomi she gives me her same confused look, but I smile, even if it was a brief second, I got her to call her Soul Gear, now just the tool is left. Mistress was right, this is going much quicker than I expected. “Well I saw your Soul Gear so moving on. Do you have a name in particular that you like?” “What does that have to do with anything?” she asks in response. I’m kind of warming to her almost stupid way of responding, but I answer back anyway, I was going to explain it either way. Your Soul Tool has a name, or you give it a name, like mine,” I tell her now holding out both hands at my side, calling their names in my head, two katana appear in either hand, a shorter on in the left, while a longer in the right. “These are my twin blades, Cain and Abel. These are my tools I use when fighting a Shell. So then, your sister’s tool is Yuki, is that why you said that before?” “Now you’re catching on, same with Dave, he uses strength and has stupidly named his ability after the Hulk. That or hammer fist, the point is the same feeling is there when you call your tool forth. So, I ask again, do you have any names in particular?” She shies away; I really thought she was over that; we’ve just conversed normally for a bit. Guess it’s too soon to tell. I let it slid and a short while later she looks down to me, “Please do not laugh.” “Don’t worry,” I tell her calmly, “It’s just a name.” “Rappinger.” She tells me. “Is that even a name?” I have to ask, it sounds kind of funny. Our small talk is cut off by a cough and I know that cough to be from Mike. Naomi spins to look to were Mike is while I just look beyond her. Mike is smiling and comes forward into the courtyard. “Naomi, you know what that means?” “What what mean?” She asks and I give Mike a concern look but he shrugs and an image comes to mind. I’ve actually seen Rappinger before. It’s the same weapon that Naomi’s mother used. She inherited her mother’s Soul Tool? “Naomi, you, as did Fate, inherited your Soul Tool from your mother. It’s a single shot rifle, you’re mother was great with it, calling forth many at once like Hope can. It’s going to be great to see Rappinger again.” Mike is almost like a kid in a candy store as he talks about his own deceased sisters Soul Tool. Getting irritated myself though, I have to stop this, both Mike and Naomi look uncomfortable even though they…well Mike is talking about a long since passed family member. “Stop talking,” I say calmly walking up to Mike, and pulling him away, Naomi remaining where she stands, and looking shocked. Mike allows me to pull him far enough away so that we are again standing on the wood flooring that surrounds the courtyard. Glaring at him he stops talking, giving me a sad look and looking back at Naomi, who is gazing off into space, she’s longing for something now and I doubt she’ll ever get it. “You’ve said too much.” I tell him, not fully aware if I am in the right but he pats my head. “Sorry, but for tonight the lessons are over. I will take the heat from Mistress, so you guys can go to bed.” He then waves at Naomi who doesn’t seem to realize she’s being waved at. “Sleep well you to.” Leaving me, I turn back to Naomi, she looks lost…no she’s always has been lost, ever since coming here. She’s never been quite with us, more a message in a bottle thrown out to sea, moving with the waves. She’s lost and I can’t think of anything to try and help her. She’s a pain but it’s like she never went to Hawaii, like when we’re kids I guess our friendship still remains however distant we are now. Walking back to her I rest a hand on her back, she doesn’t jump like that last few times I saw the others touching her, she seems at ease with me…whether good or bad, I’ll take it for now. She’ll be living with us so we might as well get use to her. 2,275 Words I want to make a few things clear that I don't think are very clear in my story, and this is probably to do with the long break I've taken with this story from 2 years ago. The first confusion is that Fate and Hope are Mike's kids, they aren't, they are, well I don't know yet, but Dave and Phil, Mike is their dad. I guess that's the main thing. The second is in the chapter before this I said Shadow, well I am swapping that for Soul. Also I mention will, will is the same as soul in that sense. But different when I say Soul Gear and Tools like I have in this chapter. I can't think of any other confusions but when I go though the next time I'll make sure everything is clear... That being said is my way of switching from narrative to first person good, or should I go either or? Or keep the same. I am surprisingly good with narrative I think but I would like some input before I go through with something different with this story.

 Chapter 8: A New Friend  Spoiler A message in a bottle out at sea, this is how Fate described Naomi. A little lost girl who has no idea what is going on. She has been told what will be happening to her, she has accepted this for why go back to Hawaii to friends that do not want her, and she has been shunned there because of her looks. There is no reason to go back now since her grandmother is dead… Uncle Mike had told her the following day that he had set a viewing for his mother the coming Saturday and that she would be buried that Sunday. But even feeling out of place, Naomi felt there was no remorse. Although the night before was strange, that was more about her mother. Naomi only vaguely remembers her. Marisa. A woman shorter then she is now, and blond hair just as long as hers. Stunning blue eye, compared to hers almost hunting teal eyes. Opposite in most aspects, so many personality traits, they could not even be considered mother and daughter besides looks—their faces, round, and their eyes large, just to name a few. While Naomi’s grandmother was still alive, Naomi has asked her about her mother and father. Her grandmother grew sad talking about the two, how they were always in each other arms and laughing at jokes that were never spoken. Always flirting, they were a perfect match. Naomi remember when she received the news of the car crash that drove her parents into the sea…she was only ten at the time and she still has yet to sort out her feelings. She keeps pushing those thoughts away; she does not want to be unhappy. But she is also scared, she always has been. After the brief talk with her uncle, she, like the rest of the students under the Mistress had to head to school. They did not take the bus though. Phil was old enough that he could drive them all in the van that they had come home in on that first day. That day…even though Naomi herself was happy, she was sad to. She was like a statue the whole drive to the school, never look out the window, just at her lap. Truthfully no one by Phil was all that worried about her and her first day. Even Fate passed her feelings from the night before as just meeting a new person she did not understand. Why should she make assumptions? Even if those assumptions are right, which they are. She does not feel right acting upon those thought so she did not try to. Hope followed her sisters lead, not sure what to do herself, she felt she may have been too abrupt with Naomi. Although she was able to make her show her will, she still sees herself as being too sudden to act on things, such as Dave, but she at least considers what she would be doing, where as Dave, he just does it. Hope wants to be friends with Naomi, it is more in her nature that with her sister. She is more understanding, she even sees that Naomi is lost, but even she does not know how to approach after she was told to attack her. Will she be angry at me…she seems lost though. There are so many confusing feelings for everyone, even Phil felt out of place for leaving Naomi suddenly the previous night to go search for his brother, who for once had a good reason for running off and even the Mistress agreed once they had returned. Dave was surprisingly a ladies’ man at school. Always popular, even though he was not a jock, but more a muscle head, always in the school’s weight room, even when class was going on. Needless to say he hears rumors about everything. Who is dating who, who got cheating on who, petty things, but on rare occasions, a rumor comes up that is important to him…to them, because of the involvement with death. That and this particular rumor falls in place with a Shell that they have been told to go after. It is not often that they are told to go after a Shell on their own, usual Mike is always with them to help out, but the Mistress sees this case as just another test, to see if they can handle it on their own. Jenny Lopez, a girl of Mexican descent. She is president of the Voice—a newspaper that the school publishes monthly. The rumor that Dave had heard on the first day of school is that Jenny’s brother had gone missing during summer break, and that he is still missing. He is surprised that he has not heard of anyone going missing even during the summer which he continually has a pass to get into school and use the weight and gym rooms as he pleases. Either way, they have been tracking an unknown Shell for quite a while now, and they are lucky it has not attacked anyone yet. They plan to enter Jenny’s soul so as to see if they can figure out of there is regret. Regret which will lead them to hopefully finding the Shell which they can feel it’s ever straitening presents. A Shell that lingers only becomes stronger, more signs show up and to those that cannot see or feel their presents will remain completely unaware. Natural tragedies’ such as a bridge collapsing of high winds…they are caused by Shells in most cases. Crying out, and wanting their agony to end. Two days have already passed, the first day I had no idea what I was doing at this school. I had gotten lost more than once, but I have managed to find my way and missing the bells quite often. But the teachers are all nice, lenient on me since I am new of which I am thankful. The first day was bad though, I kept falling asleep… Dave is in one of my classes and he is fond of his nickname for me—Sleeping Beauty. Admittedly, that has helped me in talking with a few of the students from that class. One in particular who loves hanging out with me, even sitting with me during lunch, a Jenny Lopez, a very petite girl. She claims she is the smallest girl in school, only standing four eight. She happily smiles, greeting me on the third day before we have gym together. Changing into are gym clothing, we head into the middle gym, and sit down against the wall, waiting for our teacher. “I’m still surprised you’re not more popular with everyone. Dave is right; you really are a sleeping beauty.” Blushing by her comment, I do not like to be called that, I do not want to be popular; I rather just live by getting by. She knows this all too well by embarrassing me a lot when she first started chatting with me. She still does, but I have grown accustomed to it a bit. “Sorry,” she says with a calming smile. It is warming, I can see she being an actual friend, my first friend in a long time. Looking down at my shoes I tell her I should be the one saying sorry. “I am actually really happy that you are standing by me, we have just met a few days ago, and you have not been scared off.” “Why would I be?” she questions me, coming to stand in front of me, and tilting her head like a dog. “I have never been great with people,” I reply back when she pokes me in the side. “No need to be scared of people, and if you’re scared of what people think, why bother, I’m like a class clown, everyone knows me cause I am loud, always wanting to be the center of attention because that is who I am. I’m not great with people, yet people come flocking to me, wanting to be part of my shenanigans.” A questioning look on my face I watch her amber eyes as she continues to watch me. Her smile turns into a frown and I am afraid I have done something wrong but she flips her smile and giggles, “I’m telling you to be yourself. You may be shy but people like that, you just need to pick who you stick with.” Smiling myself I mock her, I know she can take a joke, even though it is not the best joke, it still brings a smile to her face when she knows I am making an effort where I do not normally try to. “So sticking with you is a good idea?” She nods, as we hear our gym teacher calling for us to meet in the new gym. “Tomorrow we have a Voice meeting,” she sees my confused look and clears her throat as we walk towards the doors, “The Voice is a monthly newspaper that we publish about the going ons at school, why not drop by room 701a tomorrow after school.” I do not think on my answer, rather I blurt out sure with a smile still on my face. It has only been a few days but when I am around Jenny I feel comfortable being myself. She tries to swing an arm over my shoulder but cannot and instead goes for a sideways hug. “So how good are you with typing?” She asks. 1,582 Words Thanking a video, the music helped me. Anyway, the chapter was going to be longer, but with what I have planned, it will be best to split the idea here instead of having a cliff hanger every chapter. As I said in the last post, many things are going to be a bit out of place and not connected. I will fix everything like that I hope in the next draft, but as it is, this book isn't going to be like my others, it's not split into parts per say. This will be a full, and completed novel. Enjoy the coming story and know I am always happy to hear any sort of feedback.

 Chapter 9: Husk  Spoiler Naomi being the exception, the group can sense the Shell. The thing is; they are all inexperienced, where as Mike who is usually helping the group since he is also a teacher to them. Below the Mistress, he offers his assistance, but such as this case, and the nature of the dead being at their school, the Mistress has told Mike to do nothing. Her students need to learn to be discreet and a school setting is perfect to practice their stealth capabilities. Consider this, although Shells are invisible to most, those closest to death as well as those with a gift, a soul that can naturally see death. Shells are harmless to most, remaining in a semi human forum, but the longer they have been a Shell and the more they eat, usually going straight for their own regret and expanding to those that may have been involved with the regret and so on to even loved ones of the Shell—before the soul became a Shell. But this is only one type of Shell. The weakest of the three types and they only cause minor damage to the surrounding areas when they are feeding. Living. Dead. Empty. In that order of weakest to hardest. A dead Shell, a body died of natural causes, or their death doesn’t relate to why they became a Shell, such as if you are a Living Shell—you have a fight with a family member, shortly after something happens and you die. Such as this, a Living Shell is born. A dead Shell is a soul that has long since lost its sanity. These usually arise from serial killers. Hanging onto life by killing, they never had regret and thus cannot be helped such as the Living although rare cases happen where there is regret which causes them to remain a Living. But by far is the hardest to deal with, an Empty Shell. How they come about is a completely mystery, and they are rare and far between. Not even Mike and his sister had to deal with an Empty, but the Mistress, long ago had to face one down. They are varied in size, taking on a magnitude of forms and going by a very common, term—demons. Demons have a dark presents about them and even the weakest of soul can sense them. Everyone has the ability to sense, but to understand that sense is an entirely different manner. And so we come to what is called the eye. The All-Seeing Eye. The Eye of Truth. Eye of Providence. They are all one in the same, again only those able to understand the soul is able to see the Eye’s on people, usually a third eye in the middle of the forehead. Closed, but slowly opening as time goes on. A way to gauge the lifespan of said person, but also the sanity, rather than the white of the eye, as it fogs this will become dark, blackening with every misdeed. But this hard to read for those that know how. Such as with a serial killer, they think what they are doing is fine, and so there eye does not fog. Only when their sanity slowly vanishes does their eye fog… Does anybodies eye fog. Without sanity, you are that much closer to making irrational decisions and thus shortening your life. The group, save for one, they all see these third eyes on their fellow students, a way to help them determine threats, to determine who may become a Shell next. Yet, they themselves need to keep an almost emotionless level when considering going against a Shell. It is like a normal human fighting off a bear with their bare hands. It is an impossibility that they overcome over and over again with each fight. But how do you go about killing what is dead. The answer lies within their eye… This is where we find the group on the last day of Naomi’s first week, they are headed for 701a. They are going to try to figure out the regret of the Shell that they believe to be a Jenny Lopez’s brother. By going into Jenny’s eye they are hoping to find a lead. As been stated before they are inexperienced without Mike and so they must fend for themselves in this case less they want the Shell they all sense to wreak havoc over the school and possibly kill students as well as Jenny herself. School being over, it takes some time for Naomi to find her own away to the 700 hallway, but she finds it and makes her way to the door, hoping that she will be some help to her new friend who has welcomed her to this new school with open arms. What she finds upon opening the door though, she becomes tame and confused. Three students she is familiar with, but does not know all too well are lying on the floor, she sees their chests rising and falling. They are alive, but why are they sleeping? A cracked door and voices, she comes to a second room that is within 701a and labeled 701b. She recognizes the voices and enters the backroom… The small room is filled with the others and Jenny who is sleeping soundly at the desk in the center of the room. Dave and Phil have yet to notice me and Fate is sleeping soundly against the wall. “You going to be okay,” Phil asks as Hope places her forehead against Jenny’s. “Fate can always help me, this should be easy…” Her own voice trails off as she goes limp and Dave catches her before she falls. Gasping, Dave looks up to see me. I do not know what to think of this, what is happening? “Slee…” “Quiet,” Phil tells his bother before turn to me. Adjusting his glasses with his ring and middle finger he begins talking as he walks around the desk. “This is part of what we…they train for. Fate and Hope have just entered Jenny’s mind so we can get a glimpse of what we consider is a Shell that may be targeting her. I can’t explain much now because we have a job to do as well.” Phil goes quite as I finish watching Dave lean Fate against the wall next her sister. “They are all sleeping by the way, so don’t go thinking we did anything to them.” Dave adds, reading my thoughts. “Now we wait…” When I first came in, I noticed a line that was not there before on Jenny’s head, and now I bring my eyes upon it…it is an eye opening. The eye is blank at first when the pupil and cornea roll down, facing us. And only now do I notice the same things on Fate and Hope who are sleeping soundly—Hope resting her head against her sister’s shoulder. Only the three eyes in the middle of their foreheads are opened, and then come a flash and there are many partials of white light in the air and falling like snowflakes. They are even brighter and more noticeable with the setting sun’s rays coming from the opened window behind the desk. Phil notices the awe I am in and answers the question I was about to ask. “They are all memories of Jenny; they show themselves as flakes so that if we wanted, even Dave and I can see them. We aren’t very prepared yet and we can’t read them. We have a long ways to go to be honest. Again, they.” “Don’t sweat it,” Dave says resting a hand on Phil’s shoulder. “Now that we know the twins are alright we better go on the lookout. It’s pure luck it was Naomi who walked in on us… “No, I set it up this way, it’s better for her to find out now away, knowing the Mistress she would have taken forever to get her to this point. I’m going under her rule and I’ll take the punishment.” There is an eerie pause as I see Phil’s face cringe. Dave looks to his brother and sighs. “Anyway, Naomi, I know you don’t understand any of this, but stay here and make sure nothing disturbs them. It takes concentration for them to enter another’s mind. In a worst case, all three of them will mix…there personalities will never be the same.” He smiles at my reaction, but I am not sure if he is being sly or just trying to press my buttons. He loves pressing my buttons and calling me that silly nickname. “See, in front of us are their memories, intertwined… Phil coughs, already leaving the room, “We have plenty of time to explain later. Naomi, please just watch them, we’ll be on the lookout for other student or even the Shell. If you see the Shell, just run, you’re not ready to face one.” I watch them leave. Phil has always been kind, and silent, but this time, his tone, he was strict. I want to ask what a Shell is, I think I have a slight idea but I am not fully sure. They are already gone and even outside in 701a, no one but the other sleeping students remain. The door ajar I walk back toward Jenny, I have to say, I am interested in all this, and having never seen anything like it before. Her eye on her forehead wide open, never shutting and it remains staring at nothing, staring past me. It feels like a normal eye, yet not. Tilting my head I try to get a better look when a snowflake, one of the memories Dave was talking about falls in front of my face. I hear voices coming from it, I swear I can even see something but the spec falls right through the desk. Standing again from my leaning position on the desk, I am embarrassed I got that close to her face without her know, like sneaking in on a sleeping person… I glace toward Fate and Hope, even their eyes, that third eye are like their own. Like their personality giving a physical form, although Fate’s eye looks darker. I bend down for a closer look. Why am I being so curious…I am not one to pry but when I am alone I am an observer. I am very aware of my surroundings. Always have been, giggling I shy away from those thoughts. I should not praise myself; I have nothing to be praised for. I have never done anything that anyone has liked me for. Well Jenny, she likes me, no idea why. Turning on my heel I walk back to her desk where her head is bobbing as she slumbers. Clearing my throat and staring at her sleeping face…I blush at the thought but I want to ask anyway. “Why do you like me?” One of the flakes falls past me again and I hear a short sentences and tears come to my eyes. Not of sadness but of joy. “Naomi? She’s a fun girl to be with…” Letting out a sob, I actually scream when I feel a presents, looking over my shoulder my eyes widen as I see a claw flashing by me and a stinging pain in my side as I hear the sound of a rubble falling. Gasping for air I begin coughing as I breathed in dust from whatever just happened. There is a courtyard with in the walls of the school and outside the room that we all were just in. Only now do I notice this as a large black single-cell looking organism like that you would see as a sketch in the science room leaving a hole that I think I just came though. I feel warmth at my side, and I feel as if my body is half on its side and half on my chest. I feel tears in my eyes, now of pure pain and horror…I am scared. Bringing my hand to my side, I feel the sticky warmth of blood. I do not need to see it, I know I am bleeding. Why? That thing…a Shell that caused this… My eyes widen even more as I see in the large human like creature that Jenny, Jenny is in the beast’s mouth. “Jenny…” I mutter as I try to think. Phil said not to take it on, but I was able to summon both my Soul Gear and I know the name of my Soul Tool…I can do this, I have to I do not want my only friend to die, to be eaten by this thing. I can do this! “Rappinger!” I speak but nothing happens. The Shell now spits Jenny on the ground and with my blurred senses I can still tell she is breathing. She is alright still. But her eye, it is slowly darkening. Whatever that means it cannot be good. “Rappinger!” I shriek again, tears pouring out of my eyes. “Please.” Sobbing the last part, “please Rappinger!” The Shell moves forward, towering over Jenny’s sleeping body and me, I can still barely move but the pain is all but numb, why can I not call forth Rappinger. I have never seen it before yet if feels so familiar, like it is a part of me, like I am a part of it. What sounds like a mixture of a bear and alligator hissing or grunting, the Shell bends down, closer and closer it’s face is coming toward Jenny. “Rappinger! Rappinger!” Sobbing, “please, come, appear, something!” The Shell looks toward me. However it can see me, whither that off blueish black orb swirling thing in the head is an eye or not, it is staring at me. The hissing noise comes back and with its claw it picks up Jenny. Hearing its heavy steps, I watch as it comes toward me now. “No…no do not kill me, please.” Each step echos, I feel my eyes welling to the point that I cannot even see straight, everything just a blur. “Please, “I begin sobbing over and over again, forgetting everything, “I do not want to die.” “The rose…” In all the chaos, those words reach me as that silhouette I saw from a week back appears. But the lines are not smooth, they are jagged, and her voice, it sounds hollow, emotionless, not like before. But whatever the case, in the fuzziness of my sight I can see the silhouette grab hold of the Shell and push it back, yet at the same time I know the silhouette can stop it for me. I am calmed, breathing in a long breath, I think of Rappinger one more time. I feel a warmth come over me, my body glows and my clothing changes like that I saw of when Hope changed and even Fate. I feel long thigh high socks with slender knee high boots sliding up my legs like some invisible force, my shirt and bottom instantly are changed to a plated yellow skirt with a black laced trim and a white blouse with puffy short sleeves and a yellow ribbon appearing around my collar. I cannot see anything clearly but I can see that in my mind’s eye. Black white and yellow color code. I would never thought of that but that is what Fate told me, it is our personality. I jerk up, a long silver rifle with yellow engravings shooting out of my chest and helping me stand, four more come out, and when I am to the point of standing I lift off them, all of them with their barrels in the ground. I can understand them, I can feel my mother’s presents, I can even feel my grandmother’s presents within them… Looking back toward the Shell that the silhouette is barely holding off I grab two of the rifle stocks on in each hand, they feel light even though they look heavy, they are about twice the size of my arms and in a graceful movement, like it is natural I am them at that eye within the Shell My sight still blurred I know that if I hit the eye, all of this will end. I can feel both my mother and grandmother telling me this. They may not be here now but they are still looking after me, helping me, wanting me to become strong like they were. A sliver of a smile comes to my face as I fire, both shots at one and immediately spinning, grabbing the other two and firing before I spin a third time, grabbing the last gun which the barrel grows larger before it fires. I see all five bullets collide with each other such as an arrow hitting another arrow like Robin Hood. They hit my intended target; a gash clear though to the sky appears within the Shells head. Nothing like blood drops down, rather the thing remains stunned before vanishing like dust with a passing wind and Jenny falls a few feet to the ground, still asleep. My legs give out as I feel all my energy slipping from me, I felt my mother’s presents, that was the only thing comforting me as I faint. 2,882 Words 5 hours of work went into this chapter. Enjoy you guys. Thanks for reading.

 Chapter 10: Memories  Spoiler Eyes are a window to the soul. Once the eye of a Shell is taken from the body, the Shell will vanish like it was never there in the first place. But Shells remain; if enough Shells congregate in an area an eye will open, consuming all souls nearby to balance out the regret that lingers. Part of what their group does is consuming the regret of Shells by three ways. But each of those ways has disadvantages. We saw with Fate, her third eye is tainted. We will begin with the easiest of ways to mend regret, and that is to destroy the memory. But this way has the most devastating disadvantage because your soul takes on the regret by removing it. It is not as if you remember the regret, once that memory is destroyed, it remains destroyed, but little by little this eats away your sanity. It is only advice to use when absolutely necessary. Such as in the case with Jenny Lopezs brother, he had already became a Shell and once that happens there is nothing more to do but to destroy the regret. Although this case was special because Naomi, not knowing the proper ways around what their job entails went straight for a kill shot, fending for her own life as well as her new friends. Needless to say the Mistress was furious at her when they had returned home. Naomi was still out, and her Soul Gear still presents so that everyone could see with their own eyes her power, she has a strong soul. Stronger then Fates even but her personality will become her downfall. Shes weak and scared in mind, opposite her soul. The other two ways to rid regret are to mend, or solve. They have no downside when not needing to dive into a soul. In these cases they figure out the regret, and relay it. But because of their inexperience and being unable to find the wondering soul in time, they could not use these methods. By diving into a live human they risked their souls intertwining and never coming out the same. This is why Fate and Hope dived for if Dave had gone, his sporadic personality would have wreaked havoc on Jennys timid mind. Not being timid herself, a females psyche is far different than that of a male, so finding sync is much better. Fate and Hope fit this sync perfectly and so they made the dive to try and figure out what the regret of the brother was. A simple argument one the school grounds during a summer school class was all it was. That night, Zack, Jennys brother had not returned home from storming out of class earlier that morning. A search was done, but Zacks body never showed up. Where his body is at is unclear, even after searching the school grounds and all the nearby places he would have gone, nothing showed for their effort. The search was called off. And now only Jenny and her father remain. Jennys mother dying giving birth to her and the rest of their family long since dead, having died before Jenny was born. Sometime later a body was found stuffed in a drainage pipe not far from the school. An autopsy was preformed, and an identity was given after they had brought in Jennys dad. Zack had died from drowning and his body had clogged the drainage pipe. Needless to say they had him cremated, and without Jenny actually knowing what had happened to her brother, just that he is indeed dead. To cleanse the soul they must also cleanse the land, taking all the negative energy, the regret and burdening themselves, containing that regret so that an earths eye as it is called does not open. Entering anothers mind is like being bombarded by dodge balls. Both stressful and painful, its not something you can get use to. Everything is black once you enter someone elses mind, like your being sucked out of your own body. There orbs that soon appear in the darkness. White wisps you could call them they have a ghostly feeling to them, like an orb with a tail. They float around aimlessly in this darkness. The Mistress says those are the memories and entering them is tricky. Were not fully trained even and shes having us do very advance stuff. Yes weve done these kinds of things before but Mike is always with us. Not this time, this time is a test that the Mistress wants to see if we can even do by ourselves. Fate knows that and I can hear her voice echoing in the direction of one of the wisps. Shes already found the right memory out of the thousands that I see. Being blind in the physical world doesnt mean my soul is blind. I see the world through memories of others. This only being the fifth time Ive dove into someones memories I am excited each time. Finally seeing what I havent been able to. Although just memories of memories, I am great at information gathering this way. Like slipping off to sleep, I enter a wisp and the world appears around me. Were at the school and Fate is already walking away from where weve both appeareda hallway near the cafeteria at the front of the school. This part drains us, as we need to concentrate on concealing are person. If we appear in someones memories, their mind with try to make sense of us and eventually try to kill us. So the trip must be quick. We must figure out the regret. From previously constructed memories that are sorted though dreams, the world we are in can be fully explored, but as we explore, the memories change to fit. This makes finding the regret near impossible. So what are looking for are sounds, voices. Everyone remembers everything, the brain is amazing that way, but what we actually comprehend is less than half. So we have memories where there are none essentially. This way, according to Dave the rumor happened at the entrances. Spacing out I shake my head, concentrate. Im not the best at keeping focus when excited, but we need to. If any of my memories of the school mix with Jennys, our personalities will begin to intertwine. Were basically in a cup of water, and water molecules trying to stay in one place. But weve been poured into another glass. Thinking of it that was what we are attempting is near impossible. I shake the feeling as I follow her when everything gets bathed in a red tint. Both of us instantly stop and look around, waiting. This isnt a good thing. Fate pulls out a round mirror from her aprons pocket of her maids outfit. Everything goes silent, no noise or anything as she stares into the mirror. Such as the eye is a window to the soul, a mirror inside the soul is an eye to the outside world seen through the opened third eye. My sisters eyes widen as she gasps, then shouts, risking her memories intertwining with Jennys by getting emotional. What the hell are those idiots doing? Walking over to look over her shoulder I see that a Shell has taken Jenny its mouth. That must be Jennys brother. Then I remembered what Mistress told me from the night before and I frown. Where are they andNaomi Jennys neck is slack since shes asleep and her eye is opened like a viewing screen and showing us Naomi who has been attacked and is laying on her chest, bleeding from three long claw wounds on her back. We cant hear what is going on, only see, and from what we can see Naomi is in a panic. Fate looks to me, where are Dave and Phil, I thought they were going to stay near Jenny, and why I Naomi here? Why ask me? You came in after I did, you saw Naomi. I never saw her, I am just as surprised as you arewe need to be careful sister we can let our memories When I plan something, I wouldnt mess up like this, I knew Naomi would be coming after school, but we put a lock on the door. Tell me what was it that you talked with the Mistress about after I was dismissed? Frowning I watch the mirror. Naomi seems to be pleading, the Shell is moving toward her but suddenly the Shell is pushed back, is that Naomis doing? Hope, tell me? I forgotrather didnt want to tell Fate what Ive been told but Ill have to. Besides testing Naomi right now, shes also testing you to see how you can handle stress. All of this is the Mistresses plan so if youre going to blame anyone, blame herbut we best keep this a secrets, if the Mistress finds out I told you she will give me all the choirs around the house for a month. Shes silent as she rolls her eyes. Shes quick to temper when something unexpected comes along, she always has been. We continue to watch as Naomi is pushed off the ground by rifles which she then uses to fire on the Shell that is holding Jenny. Its magnificent, Ive never seen such grace that she has. In all one fluent motion she fires five rifles with point blank accuracy. Is this what the Mistress wanted us to see, to know her abilities? For a time after the Shells presents has vanished, we watch nothing but Jenny laying in the grass of the courtyard thats at the center of the school and has a cobblestone pathway though it and two trees opposite each other. Once we finally see the dress shoes of Phil enter the view we decide its best to leave this one be, we couldnt fix the regret because the soul had already turned into a Shell that that Shell was already destroyed. Leaving a mind is easier the entering and soon enough were back in the real world. Dave has already picked up Naomi and is waiting for us, and my blindness as returned, I see nothing but darkness. But my other senses are top notice and I can hear everything. Almost like sonar I can even judge distances. We need to give the Mistress a full reportand sorry Fate. Phil tells us as I hear him opening the door. Dave laughs at this, knowing Mistress chose Fate over him, but because how shes acting now. Fates been blindsided and she doesnt like that. Daves laughter stops abruptly as the wind gets knocked from his. He almost topples over, dropping Naomi in the process. Phil intervenes, telling them to stop. His footsteps come closer to me and he stops, I can feel his presents when he sets a hand on my shoulder. Can you bring Jenny back into the other room? Ill wake everyone then, and then we need to leave. Nodding, I head out the hole that was blasted through the wall and I listen for the sound of Jennys shallow breath so that I can locate her and bring her inside. 1,871 Words Since I've begun the new stuff, this is probably, or what I feel like my worst chapter...sorry but all the information I wanted is here, a bit of information I didn't want to add yet is here...but I may keep it now cause it fits and I didn't know how exactly I was going to add it later so it might as well stay. I can always edit stuff later which is great. Thanks to this video for it's overall sheer epicness.

 Chapter 11: Aftermath  Spoiler We are all born special; most notable is Hope and her blindness. It is not so much as a hindrance as it encourages her. Being blind and unable to see anything except when diving into the memories of another where all physical defects are gone, that is why she is special, not because of her abilities to use Soul Gear and Tools, but her ability to not care that she is blind, to work around that. Dave, he is a rambunctious to say the least and this is his specialness. For each person is unique. You can even say being special is what makes you who you are. Your personality is special. You living and that alone, is special. Humans have a hard time understanding this; some even have a superiority complex. You are special in your own way but conflicting with others may turn you into a foe. When people try to control without understanding the feelings that they are controlling a mutiny will break out such as being on a ship. They are all in this together, but humans need a leader. Some are better than most, but none ensues chaos. This is the Mistress flaw. Her strictness for over a decade on her current students are at best frayed, but this latest occurrences has severed a bond that was once quite close. As been said before, when her students came home, she was furious. But so is Fate. At best, she’s been tolerating the Mistresses behavior while being taught by her… They all have been tolerating her; they are all too scared to go up against her. Not even Mike would face her in a head on battle, and he has told them all that when they first began. The Mistresses abilities are unknown and she only steps in when her students cannot do their job, such as against a Dead Shell. By the time they arrive home it is already six, and schools been out since two. It is another few hours before she addresses them and their actions with taking on their first shell which they had lost and so the regret contained by the Shell was haphazardly taken care of by Naomi who has no idea what she is doing. The regret returned to the earth. They are told to stand by in the courtyard where their positions are worn into the ground such as the Mistress’s are. That is how neat she likes things, to the point and never out of line, always the same. Now eight, Naomi who returned home unconscious and still in her Soul Gear was brought to her room so that Mike can tend to her wounds—besides being an assistant to the Mistress he is also a well known doctor. He would find that Naomi suffered two broken ribs from her run in with the Shell. She is lucky she had called upon her Soul Gear when she did, or else she would have be severely wounded, if not dead from the collision with the wall that she had been tossed through. The patch work done, Naomi wakes after something with a bandage around her chest. Wincing some a knock comes to her door. It is Phil again, calling to her to come to the courtyard. She is still shocked but abides, not even noting her Soul Gear has yet to vanish, and she dresses herself in it, noticing it lying out next to her. A few minutes earlier the Mistress has told Phil to go retrieve Naomi for the tenth time, each time previously he has come back saying that she will not answer and Mike, who has dropped in on them after doing his treatment on her say he does not know how long she will be out, but that the pain killers he has given her should be affecting her soon. The boiling point reached Fate steps out of line, approaching the Mistress and her brow knitted in furry. “Why didn’t you tell me about the Shell in the area or about Naomi dropping in on us…no, why did you tell everyone but me?” Not being phased the mistress says nothing. She continues to look on, or pass Fate as if she is not even there. Fate should know better, Fate should know why. Hope already gave it away, but Fate, as with Dave, is two sides of the same coin. Only small variances’ in their personality separate them. Dave, on one hand, out of control, while Fate on the other, calm and collected. But that is the fine line… “Psycho Hag, I’m talking to you!” This reaches the Mistresses attention and her eyes widen ever so slightly by Fate’s outburst. She leaves or spot, and Fate begins to rethink her actions, yet she stands her ground only a few feet in front of where she is suppose to be standing. Frowning, she approaches, “I expect this kind of flare-up from Dave, but you…” Now close enough to Fate that they can feel each other’s breath, the Mistress brings her cane around Fates left leg and ready to strike, “you need to know your place.” Fate is never hit; instead she slides her left leg out of the way as the Mistress pulls back for her swing. Grabbing the Mistresses outstretched arm, she throws her over her shoulder. Everyone else is stunned as this occurs, even Phil and Naomi who have just entered the courtyard watch in awe as the Mistress flies in the air a bit before Fate lets go… Hoping the Mistress would slam to the ground is but a pity wish which never happens, instead she just floats in there air, slowly sinking to the ground upside down. Her face is what you may see on a mad man, an eerie smile. Her free left arm outstretched with the palm wide open and facing Fate, the sound of a whirlwind comes and in a flash Fate is sent across the courtyard, hitting the other side with a loud thud, the whites of her eyes showing and she is out like a light. Meanwhile the Mistress has landed and is back on her feet, dusting herself off as she meets eyes with Naomi. She just sent Fate flying… “Naomi, come here. Hope and Mike, attend to Fate.” Leaving their positions, they move forward to tend to Fate. Quivering I leave Phil’s side. He even seems stunned but too soon does that go away as he turns to Dave who has his own smile, “See I am better suited for the job then she is…” “You should not flatter yourself, I am not wrong in my decision to have her take my place. She at least had the guts to stand up to me. Only Naomi’s mother has ever tried that…she fared much better then Fate though.” She answers Dave as I approach her, her face looks kind, but I cannot tell if she is feigning. “Go stand next to Dave. That is where you will be standing from now on during our training sections. You will not sit unless told to which will never happen.” I take my stand next to Dave. Not even acknowledging me, he continues watching the Mistress who is now walking in front of our line like a drill sergeant. She is shorter then Dave, it is funny in a way. Giggling, not meaning too she looks in my direction, but she does not ask why I giggled. Instead she walks and stands in front of me, she is almost like a doll, why did I not notice before, and she is almost cute. Her face may be wrinkled but she retains her youthful like appearances even thought she is who knows how old… “Answer my questions.” She states, looking up to me, “firstly, what is the message you had received on your first night here.” “Wh…what?” I question back and she brings her cane forward, tapping my shin with the tip, it doesn’t hurt, but that may be because she is going easy since I am new… “Lucky,” Dave comments, “she full on whipped me my first day.” “You were being a brat, you needed to be whipped, now answer the question. I have been holding because of Mike but now that he is not paying attention I would like you to answer the questions.” “So you do listen to him,” Dave adds being smart about it. “I will not hesitate to knock you cold, there is a reason I am not dismissing you.” “Screw off hag,” He pouts, then walking away, leaving me and her to talk alone. She is not fazed by Dave’s remark and continues looking intently at me. “Your Soul Gear has not vanished, you have a very strong soul, that makes you perfect in the since you have a similar soul to your mothers.” She changes subjects and I begin to feel flustered having to think about my mother again. It has been years since her accident but I remain sadden every time she is brought up. “That is beside the point for now; I would like to hear the message. It is a rare occurrence that a Shell leaves a message rather than regret…” “I…I do not even know myself what the…well she looked more like a silhouette. If what I saw earlier today was a Shell, that other thing can best be described as a silhouette.” “She?” “Yes…well, the silhouette had a female voice.” “And?” “She keeps bringing up a rose…I even pricked myself on a rose…” The Mistress falls silent for a bit and all I hear are the noises from the other group helping out Fate who remains unconscious. I hear Mike ask why the Mistress threw her so hard but I believe that was more to him because the Mistress remains staring up at me like she is trying to figure something out. “This Silhouette of yours, did she help you any besides?” She asks as if knowing the question already. I nod, finding it odd that she knows stuff that I do not know myself. But maybe that is why I am here? For this woman to help me understand things, I have yet to receive a full explanation on anything, and the most I know is I am here to train, train to fight Shells. “Yes,” I tell her, “I think she helped me on the first night when Hope was attacking me in the beginning, but I know she helped me a second time against that Shell was it…she held off the Shell while I got these clothing and five rifles to fire at it.” Not adding anything more, she continues on into another question. “What about just now, you saw the entire exchange between my unruly student and I. What did you see?” Blinking, I’m not sure how to answer this question, “I saw her flip you and you let out some kind of air cannon from your hand…” “Not what you think you saw,” she scolds me, “what did you see?” I think back on when we first entered, the exchange I saw…her hand, her hand looked younger…her whole appearances was younger, even her hair, not gray but blond, her face, that of a twenty year old woman… “You looked young.” She smiles, and I think she blushes as well, the moon high in the sky, its luminescence barely showing up as we stand beneath an awning that encircles the opened courtyard. Nodding she spins on her heel. “Everyone,” she says loudly and gaining everyone’s, even Fate who has manage to awaken. “I have to congratulate you on your first encounter alone with a Shell…you did better than Mike’s group…” “Please don’t bring that up, that was a mess…” Mike signs which gets Dave’s attention. Seems he never left, just hung out near Fate and the others while the Mistress was talking with me. “What happened?” Dave asks and Mike scowls, not saying anything. 2,001 Words I'll say this now, a new chapter will come out ever week to two weeks. I don't know how to forewarn you guys because each chapter is different. I thought this chapter would be out last week, but nope. So ever Thursday, or every other Thursday, look forward to reading a chapter, just like a manga.

That is where you will be standing from now on during our training sections.” I take my stand next to Dave. Not even acknowledging me, he continues watching the Mistress who is now walking in front of our line like a drill sergeant. She is shorter then Dave and it is funny in a way. Giggling, not meaning too she looks in my direction, but she does not ask why. Instead she pivots and stands in front of me, she is almost like a doll, why did I not notice before, and she is almost cute. Her face may be wrinkled but she retains her youthful like appearances even thought she is who knows how old… “Answer my questions.” She states, looking up to me, “what was the message you had received on your first night here?” “Wh…what?” I question back and she brings her cane forward, tapping my shin with the tip, it doesn’t hurt, but that may be because she is going easy since I am new… “Lucky,” Dave comments, “she full on whipped me my first day.” “You were being a brat, you needed to know your place, now answer the question. I have been restraining because of Mike but now that he is not paying attention...” “So you do listen to him,” Dave adds being smart about it. “It is best not to interrupt me, I will not hesitate to knock you unconscious, there is a reason I am not dismissing you.” “Screw off hag,” He pouts, then walking away, leaving me and her to talk alone. She is not fazed by Dave’s remark and continues looking intently at me. “Your Soul Gear has not vanished; you have a very strong soul, which makes you perfect in the sense that you have a similar soul to your mothers.” She changes subjects and I begin to feel flustered having to think about my mother again. It has been years since her accident but I remain sadden every time she is brought up. “I would like to hear the message. It is a rare occurrence that a Shell leaves a message rather than regret.” “I…I do not even know myself what the…well she looked more like a silhouette. If what I saw earlier today was a Shell, that other thing can best be described as a silhouette.” “She?” “Yes…well, the silhouette has a female voice.” “And?” “She keeps bringing up a rose…I even pricked myself on the stem…” The Mistress falls silent for a bit and all I hear are the noises from the other group helping out Fate who remains unconscious. I hear Mike ask why the Mistress threw her so hard but I believe that was more to him because the Mistress remains staring up at me like she is trying to figure something out. “This Silhouette of yours, did she help you any besides?” She asks as if knowing the question already. I nod, finding it odd that she knows stuff that I do not know myself. But maybe that is why I am here? For this woman to help me understand stuff and I have yet to receive a full explanation on anything, the most I know is I am here to train, train to fight Shells. I have accepted this. “Yes,” I tell her, “I think she helped me on the first night when Hope was attacking me in the beginning, but I know she helped me a second time against that Shell was it…she held off the Shell while I got these clothing and five rifles to fire at it.” Not adding anything more, she continues on into another question. “What about just now, you saw the entire exchange between my unruly student and me, what did you see?” Blinking, I’m not sure how to answer this question, “I saw her flip you and you let out some kind of air cannon from your hand…” “Not what you think you saw,” she scolds me, glaring now, “what did you see?” I think back on when we first entered, the exchange I saw…her hand, her hand looked younger…her whole appearances was younger, even her hair, not gray but blond, her face, that of a twenty year old woman… “You looked young.” She smiles, and I think she blushes as well, the moon high in the sky, its luminescence barely showing up as we stand beneath an awning that encircles the opened courtyard. Nodding she spins on her heel. “Everyone,” she says loudly and gaining everyone’s attention, even Fate who has manage to awaken and now barely standing with the support of Hope helping her. “I will congratulate you on your first encounter alone with a Shell, you did better than Mike’s group…” “Please don’t bring that up, that was a mess…” Mike signs which gets Dave’s attention. Seems he never left, just hung out near Fate and the others while the Mistress was talking with me. “What happened?” Dave asks and Mike scowls, not saying anything. A long silence hangs in the air as a breeze passes through and the Mistress, still looking out at everyone grows an eerie smile. “They were to help a grieving widow of a bowling alley they always were at...” Mike stands at this point, not saying a word and leaves the room now that Fate is fine even though she’s shaky and I see blood trickling down the curve of her face and dripping down the ground. Yet, both Fate and Hope remain, listing to the Mistresses story. We all listen intently… “…after her husband was buried I had sent them to dive into her mind such as I had you doing likewise today. They had gotten as far as putting her in the trance when her husband’s Shell showed up. Completely unprepared, Marisa was hit and knocked unconscious first. Isabella was next, receiving a broken arm and a sprained ankle from a side swipe of the Shell’s tail. She was the only one still working at the Shell when I arrived.” “Our mother used Soul Gear? Hope asks as if surprised. The Mistress nods, “Fate, your Soul Tool at least is the same as your mothers.” “But she never told us…” This time it is Fate who speaks up, both of them wearing shocked expressions. “She never told you guys because after that she quite, she did not like the task she was born into and ran away. That is why you two are here, and your parents are not. Both of them never liked the idea of you two in harm’s way and after some talking Mike got them to agree to letting the two of you live here and under my guidance.” “Our mother is a coward…” Fate almost shouts, “what about our dad, was he able to use Soul Gear? Might as well tell us now, I have a felling you’re saying all this because Mike is away.” “Precisely, there are not many secrets that I hold, but those that I do; Mike has kept me in check. But he is indeed a nuisance. Enough chit chat, I shall continue, and as my students you will continue to listen. I say things for a reason; it is your jobs to understand. Do you understand?” She rises her voice and she really does not sound like an old woman would, her voice is still crisp and clear, it has a roughness, but that does not subtract from the subtleness. “Yes,” we all echo together and she continues with her story. “Mike was beaten senseless some time before my arrival. And by this time the whole bowling alley was in ruins. You see, this was the regret of the Shell that formed. He regretted not being able to pay off his business and leaving it all to his wife to tend with. He was a proud man and was too stubborn to tell his wife that he was ill, and so, his downfall. He went to a Shell state as soon as his death. I had them act quickly.” Pausing she looks down at her own self, her weight shifting from one leg to the other. “I had arrived to help and was a bit careless, I ended up getting whipped by one of his tails while helping Isabella and I shattered a knee cap. That is why I have this cane,” she now rises her cane and takes a step forward, and only now do we all look in awe at her, how bad of a limp she actually has. With the cane, it never looks like she has a limp, every time I have ever seen her walk, she has had the cane, and not once has she shown such a weakness at least that I know of. The others watch on as she takes another step and a grim expression revels itself on her face. Phil is the first to act, stepping forward from where he stands when the Mistress holds up a hand. “Do not dear to show me sympathy, even I make mistakes! I am only human.” An awkward silence fills the courtyard. The Mistress takes a few more steps, even going as far as turning on her injured leg before bring her cane back down and her expression going back to normal, that stern look as if she never bore an expression before. Her walking was back to that of normal, like she never had the limp before. “It has taken many years for me to get my body to be able to stand like I am, it is very uncomfortable and this is the reason why Mike took off. He is mad at himself, thinking he could have done better. So I tell you this, let this be a lesson. You screw up…as this younger generation say, and you face those faults head on. You cannot say it was your fault someone else got hurt because it was their fault from following your lead. A chain reaction…it is my fault for not informing you about the Shell, you are still inexperienced enough to not have noticed it but that is also your fault for not have been expecting the worst of the situation. You went in laxed, Fate I am talking to you directly. Since you are the team leader here, this all rides on you and your own team from following you blindly.” “You told them and not me!” Fate yells. “You lack insight, you expected face value. I would have figured by now you would never trust what I say.” “I trust you for your word that is why I am so pissed right now.” “And I am trying to teach you a lesson that you are avoiding right now.” Now they just stare at each other for a long time, and to be honest I have no idea what they are getting at, the Mistress, she talks in riddles I feel like, or code, she is trying to lead Fate to the answer, yet Fate brings up a good point. Deceit seems to be the Mistresses message…I think, I am not even sure myself. “That is enough for tonight,” Mike enters, looking irritated. “I need to talk with the Mistress alone; you kids can head to bed. Prepare for the funeral tomorrow…Naomi, congratulations and finding your Soul Gear. Dismissed.” Standing in my position for a while longer, I am lead away by Phil who comes up to me, grabbing my wrist and pulling me with him, he talks quietly to me aw we pass the Mistress and Mike who has come up to her for their chat. “When Mike is mad, it’s even scarier then when the Mistress is, the Mistress is mad all the time but Mike, he’s like a dormant volcano. Nodding, I can do nothing but follow along; Phil’s grip is quite strong. 3,145 Words I have to apologizes, I released an incomplete chapter and only after the fact did I realize that, and even more so because it took me so long to finish writing the same chapter. I'll have the next chapter on on Thursday so look forward to that. I have changed nothing with the narrative, the part after that I have edited and after that added more. This is the complete chapter that I should have posted two weeks back.

 Chapter 12: An Explanation  Spoiler And so we begin again, where we left off A week has passed since Naomis grandmothers death. She has been prepped for viewing the coming Saturday afternoon. Everyone is ready, dressed in funeral attire. Black dress for the ladies; and black suits for the men. Although just a viewing, the Mistress thought it proper if her students all wore black and looked nice. She wants her old friend to see that she is still the same even after the many years they have spent apart. But she will never notice this, a week has already past and with that, her third eye has closed already. But her memories linger, they will linger for a while until the soul can peacefully ascend. Yes, she will ascend, her experiences have told her so; although she had Alzheimer and as such most of her memory being diminished, what she does remember lead her on to peace. But whether those places exist is another matter entirely. The viewing is near over, and the Mistress has asked that Naomi and her are the last ones to see her before they bury her in the old graveyard behind the mansion. Its been three hours since the viewing began, and everyone has filed out of the room, allowing Naomi and her a bit of quite while they view a friend, and a grandmother. Approaching the casket which holds my grandmother, I surprisingly do not feel sad. I feel this has to do with the night before when I fought against that Shell. When I called forth my Soul Gear and Tool I was enveloped in my grandmothers and mothers soul. Both long gone from the world now, I can still feel them resonating within me. Uncle Mike mentioned that it is an inheritances tool. Rappinger, the name of the tool that my mother used. I feel my grandmother used him as well. Kind of like a ship, the tool has a personality of its own, he felt strong while I welded him. I stare down at my own two hands pausing a few rows from the casket as this train of thought comes to mind. I understand very little but I feel like this is what I should be doing nowboth my mother and grandmother have given me their blessing when I was attacked. Naomi, the mistress asks, now in front of the casket. I want you to tell me what you see again. And she moves her arm over my grandmother as if she is displaying her. Letting my arms fall to my side, I continue forward. Once at her casket I stare down at my dead grandmothers face. I see a sliver on her forehead. This is the eye thing I saw last night, but it is closed. I seewhat use to be that third eyeI think. Do not be so hesitant, you are correct. The others cannot see the eye yet, their personalities are still changingthe more mature you are or well developed your personality is the better you can see the unknown. This is why I asked you in the first place, you personality is stable, you can see and understand things they the rest of you team cannot Nodding, I am only slightly paying attention to her, my eyes are on my grandmother, her sleeping face looks peaceful and I can only imagine that she has gone to a better place, she has gone to her husband who died years and years before her. I remember stories she use to tell me of him, the strong and able young man that stole her heart and fought bravely in Vietnam. He had died due to a heart attack and stress shortly after returning home. I hear the Mistress clearing her throat and I look over my shoulder, you seem to have spaced out while I was still talking. I will understand if you want to have today off, but we have training later. Shaking my feelings away, yes, I am sad, but no, I want to be of help, I want to help so I must train as well so I understand everything. Almost choking on my words for speaking so fast I deter the Mistresses statement. I will practice with everyone today, I should not be mopping because I already know my grandmother went to a nicer place. The Mistress smiles a broad grinning expression, good, just like your mother would have told me. She pauses as she turns back down the aisle, about to leave me. Before then I believe you need a proper explanation on everything you have witnessed. Feel free to visit Phil in the library which is only a few doors down; double doors, they are not that hard to miss. He will probably be there studying. Saying nothing more she leaves the room, her cane echoing on the wood flooring as she departs and leaves me to say a last good bye to my grandmotherand my mother...she was like my mother after my actual mother had passed on. We have had great times even with her demising memory. Rest in peace, I sigh, leaving the caskets side. Following the Mistresses steps out of the room, a left, no, that is where we came from, and there were no double doors. I take a right, following the hall for a long time before coming upon two large double doors with brass handles. Allowing myself in I am greeted with a musty smell. This library is like a tower, with semi circular book cases lining the wallsas I enter deeper into the room I notice just how tall this tower is. At least three stories because I can see circular balconies lining the inside, and at the center a chandelier with surprisingly realistic looking candles on it, but the flicker tells me they are electric. Coming to a bookshelf I peak my head around it to see, at the far end of the room a desk, and many books piled high on the desk. Behind that desk, a large window, spanning at least two of the stories and allowing the afternoon sun in. I do not hear a sound until that of a page turning, I wait a while longer, not seeing anyone but again the turning of a page comes so I speak up. Phil? No one was sitting at the desk, instead, it looks as if Phil was leaning against the chair of the desk and has now stood up. He spins to face me and he places the book he was reading down, bending one of the pages corners so that he can find his spot later. Im surprised you found your way hereI told the Mistress Id be here in case you wanted an explanation, but I was expecting you a bit later. Why is that? I ask, already walking toward the desk, I am astonished by the wide variety of book titles I already see, they are not normal reading books, more like text books you get from school. Large and bulky books with titles spanning from things about zombies, to that of science and whats in space He takes note of me looking at the many books on his desk and then answers, I would of thought you would have spent more time with your grandmother, from what I hear from Mike, the two of you are quite close. We are, but I think she would not want me sad over her death. I am not but that is only because of what I felt yesterday when I called my Soul Gear and Tool to me. That was a very pleasant experience. Im glad to hear that, so youre now looking for an explanation, am I correct? I nod in agreement as he pulls out the wooden and quite uncomfortable looking chair to sit down. Lets begin with what all you saw yesterday, I can explain that to you the quickest. Nodding again, I am not sure what I got myself into, but I listen intently as he tells me everything from what a Shell is, to something about the Earths eye that he has been studying for a while now. The sun behind him is casting shadows one parts that once were sunny, he seems to love talking. So then, in review he then motions to me to continue. Shells are regret that has not been solved; there are three kinds, Dead, Living, and Empty. They are also known as poltergeists, and only on rare occasions can actually be seen, and thats when a Earths Eye would open. The snowflakes I saw yesterday are memories of a person and can be seen if you believe hard enoughwhich does not make senses. Either way continues, so far so good. Taking in a deep breath, I exhale before continuing with a shorten version of what he went into ridicules depth to tell me about. Everyone has a third eye that shows both their life span when dying naturally by how opened it is and their sanity by how clouded the eye is. Then lastly Soul Gear and Tools respond to your personality and how strong willed you are. What else, he says as I pause for a bit to regain my breath, I am talking incredibly fast, I do not know why but it must be my nerves, I am shaken even. Phil notices me and stares at me with a questionable expression as if silently asking if I am alright. A lot has happened to you in such a short time, maybe you should take it easy. I shake my head, this is one of those mind-over-matter things, and just because my body is acting funny should not mean I should take it easy. I want to understand my situation. I cannot believe me coming here just for training was coincidences. What are you talking about, youre obviously stressed. Really you should take a load off. Dont push yourself, its not healthy and I dont take you as mentally stable I knit my brows, offended by his statement. What do you know about how stable I am? I, I dont, he backs off immediately, he knows he said the wrong words to me and then looks down at his books, Listen I am working on a theory, you want to hear it? He is obviously changing the subjectbut I am not in the mood to argue at the moment. I was feeling well a moment ago, now anxiousmaybe I should take a load off. Okay, I mutter under my breath and he smiles, picking up a book, flipping it open and then staring back at me. As you may have already noticed, I have no Soul Gear or Tools. I have not. I tell him just as coldly even though this does come as a surprise. I am the brains behind this team, I am constantly studying stuff. I am much more prepared then they all are. I understand the situation before Fate does. The Mistress talked to you all the night before and told you about some plan to use meI do not liked that I was used but from the sounds of it, it was the only way for me to gain my gear. That is all true, and Fate was left out of this because Fate does have a soft side, she never wants to see anybody hurt. She may be cold but dont take that to heart. Anyway, I always want to say I do not believe in anything that is going on currently. The Shells, I have never once seen one that looks like what have been described and I believe this is because of how close I am with death. How close we all are. I know this actually. But this also deals with how it impacted us, how we feel, how we experienced the death. This is why I see them as but a blur like a finger in a camera photo. I have experienced death but that has never effected me as it has you guys. That and that I dont believe in them is why I cant call upon my own Soul Gear and Tool. Struggling to stand much longer I end up sitting cross legged on the ground and he in turns stands up, a smug look on his face, as if he won a game of chicken. Coming around the desk, he now leans against it, folding his arms and looking down at me. Are you wondering how this fits in with my theory Youre being a bit mean today. Smiling he lets out a laugh, adding to what I just said. He is being mean to me. I dont mean to, so sorry in advance. On to the theory, more of a statement, but from what I have gathered, Shells have only appeared within the last two hundred years and I for one think every think has a cause to it, so such as the Shells appearing, there must be a cause, dont you agree. Nodding, he gives me a looks as if I just nodded to agree with him but did not know what I was actually nodding to. Well my only conclusion as of yet is as farfetched as it sounds, demons. Frowning, I plainly state, you do not make senses. Its a gut feeling for nowI believe in Shells a little more each day as I study their history and how they came to be which is proving a pain right not. Like I have the idea on the tip of my tough but I cant bring myself to acknowledge it. I am still not sure what you are getting at but sure. Scratching my head, I stand myself up; I have learned a lot from him, even if he did insult me. Ill be going now; I think you are done, right? He quiets down from the tizzy he seemed to have worked himself into. As I part with him, and walking around the book case I was leaning against I hear him speak up, I am sorry. I turn to look over my shoulder, he is not following me, but I know he is still beyond the bookshelf, It is alright, I believe we are all a bit stressed. Everyone needs to get use to me, and I need to get use to you guys. Agreed. He says back and I depart from the library. 2,419 Words Not my best chapter...also sorry for being three weeks late XD...I havn't been in the mood for what ever reason. Next chapter will come sooner then three weeks, other then that don't listen to what I say, the chapters shall come when they come.

 Chapter 13: Inheritance (Part 1)  Spoiler Silently I wait. Listening to the subtle movements around me and taking into consideration my next actions. Birds chirping, the wind blowing, and the leaves and branches of trees dancing upon that wind. The grass crunches to my left only a few feet off and I pull out my throwing knifes from the garter around my thigh. In a quick movement they are released from my hand, but they miss their target. But the grass crunching continues, going in a circle starting on my left I pivot on my left foot, continuing to hail Yuki at my target. Metal on metal connects and for a moment I lose the sounds of her steps, when I direct my listen to the wind. A mass is obstructing the wind flow on my left again…she made a full circle before trying to attack me again, and now she’s coming from above. Manipulating the air around them, from the friction generated from throwing the knifes, they seem to freeze in the air as if I had stopped time. I let a barrage of them fly in the direction of my target as I retreat backwards to avoid the assault that’s will be coming my way. They are easily dodged at my sister comes straight for me, her Soul Tools drawn. I hear new steps on the ground of the mansion entering the backyard were we’re now training. The Mistress has already told us what’s today session is going to be, and it’s going to be Naomi and me versus, to demonstrate our inherited Soul Tools. “You two may stop,” the Mistress calls out, “Fate, please come back to the lineup and rest, you did well.” She stops just in front of me, landing with grace on both her feet before going into kneeling to lessen the stress on her muscles. Standing she leaves me, and I hear her walking away. Sometimes I wonder if I can really do my job correctly. I can hear things that normal humans can’t although I am human. Smiling to myself I wait for the next orders from the Mistress. “Glad you found your way here,” the Mistress signs, and she sounds a bit frustrated. “Did Phil not tell you we would be back here?” A nervous “yes” comes from Naomi. “Sometimes that boy is just as bad as you are, Dave” and I know she’s glaring at Dave, the mistresses stances changes when she’s an great, favoring whatever foot is closer to the person she is talking to. It’s different when she uses her bad leg though. I knew about that way before she demonstrated that a night back. Never told her feeling bad for her, but now that we know what happens, I’m kind of happy I never brought it up. She puts emphases on his name. While Dave remains rock hard and emphases, he stopped fearing the Mistress a long time ago, and perhaps that lead to her rather cold state he’s now in. Never wavering to even the slightest of things and always diving head long into a bad situation. He enjoys himself what those come along. Her stances changes again, and she ushers Naomi to the middle of the yard where I am at. Directly in front of me stands the mansion’s backside, and behind me, a forest of trees. The middle were we’re at, a small patch of open land that we came back here when we’re doing serious scrimmages against each other so we can let loose and not cause any harm to the mansion. And just to the right side of the mansions only entrances back here stands everyone else in an ordered line. “A brief explanation on inherited Soul Tools…Dave go fetch your brother, he should hear this as well.” She ends, and by this time Naomi is already standing next to me, but she hasn’t donned her Soul Gear yet, so I am expecting she is waiting for the Mistress’s order to do so. And as soon as she’s done saying her sentence I hear Dave loud steps leave the area, and not five minutes pass do I hear them return. I hear a thud along with a small cry of pain that comes from Phil who obviously didn’t want to come to this session and was told earlier by the Mistress he didn’t have to. The Mistress changes her stances again, and begins walking in front of the line. “To begin, what do you all know about inherited Soul Tools?” 752 Words Normally I'd wait till I have the whole chapter done before posting, but considering it's raining, and storming and there is a good chance I loose power here I am going to post what I have done, and the second half later. Here you guys are along with a YouTube video that helped. Oh, and no narrative this time around, wasn't sure what too add so none in this weeks chapter.

 Wow, it's gotten even better than the last time I read it! Good job, MoSteel senpai! Of course, besides the grammar problems, there's not much to worry about, though I can't understand some of the sentences you wrote up... As to be expected of you, MoSteel senpai. Hope you have more fun writing this stuff. 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.

And as soon as shes done saying her sentence I hear Dave loud steps leave the area, and not five minutes pass do I hear them return. I hear a thud along with a small cry of pain that comes from Phil who obviously didnt want to come to this session and was told earlier by the Mistress he didnt have to. The Mistress changes her stances again, and begins walking in front of the line. To begin, what do you all know about inherited Soul Tools? So then there is more to them than just a name? Phil asks, picking himself up and standing in his position in the line, between Fate and Dave. You are foolish for thinking that, the Mistress sighs, they are inherited for two reasons. One, they are the same weapon from a past generation. This is how you currently understand inheritances. And two, She now stops in front of Phil, a recollection. Hope and Naomi may not understand this but allow me to explain. She says with a gleam, showing what little emotion she does. Hope, your movement, your actions, and everything about when you use your Soul Toolfeels familiar. It feels like you understand your tool and you know its strengths and weaknesses, its possibilities. Questioning me, I understand what shes saying, what shes telling us. I do understand Yuki, I know what shes capable of. Yes, Mistress, I reply back loudly. Yes, and you Naomi, her stances changes again and she faces Naomi whos shaking. She really is scaredor excited. She feels excited not nervous. Did you feel your mother when you went against the Shell? Your grandmother? I did she says quietly. The Soul Tools that are inherited have memorized the movements of their past users. So that being said, Id like to get out of the way and watch you two have a scrimmage and judgejust how in tuned with Marisas soul you may be. She walks a few more steps, then stopping; she stands to the right of Dave, her usual spot. Begin! A soft glow shines. I may be blind, but I can make out light, however faint. Shes in her gear, so that means I can begin, Ive already hesitated though and I hear her steps. Shes side stepping to her right, circling me, just as my sister did earlier. In a swift movement I bring both hands down to the opposite legs garter belt. Pulling out four of my throwing knifes in each I side step to my left. Both of us in a standoff now, waiting for each of us to make the first move. Being the rookie that she is, she dashes forward; I feel a pleasant aura around her. Shes really is happy, is this cause of the Mistress telling us about our inherited Soul Tools? She stumbles and I take my first shot, throwing my right hand and releasing Yuki on her, but she uses her mistake to correct herself, her hand comes down to catch herself and she rolls to her left, using her arm to push herself off the ground. At the same time she calls forth her own tool. Still on the ground and on her back, her tools presents appears in her right hand and aimed at me. The shot sounds but I easily dodge, allowing myself to spin on my heel. The shot rings in my ears as it soars past my head and I release Yuki from my left hand, aiming for where Naomi is. I now realize my disadvantage against her having felt my knifes not hitting anything but the solid dirt. Jumping backward to gain some distances between us, I wait. Part of being blind is waiting. Concentrating on the noises around you, my ears are super sensitive, which is both my advantage and disadvantage. Like a dogs sense of smell. My ears ringing I have trouble locating where Naomi is, of if shes even moved. Does she realize my handicap? The cocking of a rifle tells me my answer, shes right next to me, and her rifle pointed at me head. Dodge it! I hear my sister yell to me. This is a scrimmage match, but even in these weve been serious injured before. Fate and Ive both got broken bones from being hit by Dave when we were younger. My hearing is back to normal, but only briefly as I freeze time by moving so fast and easily dodging the shot, but the ringing continues because the shot was so close to my head again. She knows my weakness already or does sheis this just coincidence? Doing a front flip and bringing my hands down, I feel her rifle hitting between my calf and I hold the rifle firm as I rip it from her hand. She cant fire again because its a single shot, but I already feel the present of a second rifle in her right hand, this one was in her left. Leaping with my hands like an acrobat, I am back on my feet, during which time I tossed the rifle into the air so that I can catch it but its already dematerialized. Im left waiting for nothing and am thus opened again. She never does fire the rifle in her right hand; instead she comes at me, elbowing me hard in the stomach and sending me sliding back. Disoriented, I hear the cocking of her rifle again and haphazardly I dodge and stumble to the ground, tripping over my own legs. Hope! What is with you, why are you so out of it? I hear Dave yell, and its surprising to hear from his, hes normal concerned with just himself. The Mistress clears her throat. Im not surprised by her being timid towards Naomi, although shes great; having now met someone who can throw her off her toes is new. Shes overcoming this, she needs to too become stronger and just by fighting you and Fate, shes so use to you guys its not even a scrimmage anymore. This is perfect so stay quiet and both of you, no more helping her. Shes distracted, I pull out more knifes from my garter belts and run as quietly as I can to the opposite side of Naomi while she is paying attention to the Mistresses comments. But with the Mistress done I feel Naomis stance change. Shes noticed that I am gone from where I was before. Now behind her I let both hands loose and I go for more knifes. All together I let loose a volley of sixteen knifes her way. She raises the rifle at me and shoots, scattering them around her and I drop to the ground, lowering myself so that the bullet flies over head. Naomis aim is remarkable, each time shes been aiming at my face. I cant hear again but I am getting better at detecting her. Run to the back of her, she turns to face me and the woods behind us. We seem to be tied, she comments, acting overly confident. She seems to be shy and sheepish but when in the mood, she goes all outshes a strange one. Making no comment and concentrating I begin throwing volley after volley her way, they vanish a foot out from me, then reappear, making a dome of knives around her. But her stances doesnt change, she isnt shaken by them at allquite the opposite. Im shaken by the presents I feel, her rifles, they are all around me just as my knives are around her. When did she do thathow did she hide their presents from me? What sounds like a spring releasing and I hear a gasp from the others, I even hear to word bayonet escape Phils mouth. Striking first I release the hold on my knives around Naomi and she does the same a millisecond later, her rifles fire first then come flying where I stand only to miss as I sidestep them and try running through the mass only to get tripped by something. Standing, my sister shouts to me, Concentrate! I then hear a slap. The Mistress has slapped her, but Fate is right, I need to concentrate, and I do, with the help of the wind. I can hear subtle vibrations around me. It doesnt take me too long to realize just what is happening. Naomi, using the trees, shes called forth a new Soul Tool that we hadnt realized that she had. Its a ribbon, or some kind of string. Shes used the trees to make a spider web and Im caught in the middle of it. I try to move, understand my situation but Naomi speaks up. The ribbon is wrapped around the trigger of my rifles. Try to move and youll be shot. Finish her, I hear Dave chuckle followed by an ow, from, being elbowed in the side by Phil. The Mistress ignores them and advances on us, You two both did well, but we couldnt expect a second tool from you. She addresses Naomi. That was quite a show, you movements are your own but your handling of your Tool is like Marisa. And Hope, she turns on me and I feel the ribbons around me loosen Looks like she won this match. You did well too for a first time against her. But remember Marisa was one of my best students and shes her daughter. Her stance shifts. Tonights training is over for you two, go take your position. Fate and Dave, you two are next. The ribbons vanish around me and Naomi comes up to me, Need a hand? she asks. 2,279 Words Full chapter is done, took me long enough plus all day today I've been busy so it was broken up so it not as good as it could be. But that's what editing is for. Enjoy.

 Well, I think I have ADD or something because I keep switching between my stories...those of you that do follow along probably have noticed. Either way, more chapters will be coming for Soul Cry since it was probably one of my better works. Main thing to know since I'm continuing this is that Naomi doesn't know the name of her Soul Tool. I can do alot more with her not knowing then her knowing...plus I'm trying to think of a better name then what I had. So far Ohana is the closest but makes no sense like Kain and Able and Yuki. Plus Naomi has two, so I need two good names, one for her rifles and the other her ribbons that fit her personality. So from the next chaper, its as if she doesn't know their names. I'll post the next chapter with the week or the week after. Thanks for enjoying this project.
