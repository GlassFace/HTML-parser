[Manga] What kind of paper is Manga printed on?
 I've done my best to contact various publishing companies all around the board about this very simple question, but it seems to be all but too much for them to pay any attention to. My question is simply: What kind of paper do publishers print manga books on? I don't think it needs to be any secret, but it has begun to nag me more and more as I look to eventually self publish the work I'm creating. Nothing beats having something in your hands that you can feel, smell, and truly embrace. It's why I'll always preffer paper over digital because it's just that much more natural and real. So if any of you may know the answer to this, I'm all ears. I could care less if self-publishing companies can print books the same size. It's all about the whole package; size and kind of paper is key to manga. My ultimate goal is to track down a company that uses this golden standard of paper for printing and is willing to work with self publishing authors. Thank you!
