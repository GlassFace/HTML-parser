[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires

(For instance, I really enjoyed Fam the Silverwing after Last Exile but too many of them are more like the horrid Eureka 7: Ao sequel instead I do have high hopes for the Princess and the Pilot prequel though. So far it looks good! But that's movie-to-anime so it's a different case.).
