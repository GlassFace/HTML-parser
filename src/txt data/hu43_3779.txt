[Action] Durarara!!×2
 A half a year after the events of the first season, Ikebukuro has begun to return to normal. High school is in session, Izaya is back to scheming, and Celty, the legendary headless rider, is still chased by the police as she rides through the town. But a few unusual things have slipped into the mix. Gradually, thanks to outside elements, Ikebukuro will be thrown back into chaos. Season two will be split into three arcs. Shou Ten Ketsu Each arc is roughly Eight episodes and I believe it was stated that Ten will begin in the summer and Ketsu will begin Winter of 2016.
