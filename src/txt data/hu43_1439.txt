[Drama] Coppelion
 I had posted something about this a number of seasons ago but something happened and it never aired... but it looks like the broadcast is finally confirmed again for this fall season! This is a seinen series, which is something we don't have enough of! Synopsis: In 2016, a catastrophe occurs after a nuclear meltdown from the nearby Odaiba nuclear power plant contaminates Tokyo, forcing the government to order its citizens to evacuate. 20 years later, Tokyo has become a ghost town due to the high levels of radiation which the government has banned entry for anyone. When a distress signal is received from Tokyo, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force dispatches 3 teenage girls from the Dispatch 3 Special Force Coppelion. Due to genetic engineering, the Coppelions are immune to radiation while also possessing special skills. Thus Coppelion journey to the ruin capital to find survivors.

 Arg stop posting these, i already have enough on my list! This seems like a good story idea, and seinen is always good. Do we have any dates other than 'Autumn'?

They call themselves "Coppelion," and are on a mission to save the people of Tokyo. Apocalyptic theme huh?

 I remember reading some of this manga a couple years ago and wishing it was an anime. Well then, let's get started. EDIT* Saw the first episode. I expect a lot from this series. The setting is so identical to Spec Ops: The Line, and that really gets my hopes up.

We are just 'one' within the 'all.' But only when those 'ones' gather together can 'all' exist. - Edward Elric. 
 First episode was pretty interesting. Slow-paced, but interesting. I have a feeling this show won't just be eyecandy. 
 
 Episode 1 will keep you guessing! XD

 Episode 2... wow! This has fast-tracked to my favorite of the season. I've enjoyed everything I've seen so far, but this is the first new show to really speak to me. Already in the second episode, I'm already crying tears!

 This show is so gooooooooood. I hate watching shows that are airing, it's so hard waiting for the next episode, and I usually stop watching along the line.

 hahah! I love the ending theme, it kinda sets the mood.

 Was an interesting episode. Still loving the show thus far and the OP/ED themes are both very nice. (As expected of Angela) assuming the doggie will be a companion from now on, I fear for the moment when it dies. It's gonna happen, always does. And if there's one thing I can't take it's a doggie getting killed 
 
  Spoiler Its hard to grow emotionally attached to the couple since the audience only sees them for 12 minutes and the flow of the story seems weird.... its probably because there is little details given about the girls and little to no back story so far. I can understand not giving full details immediately to push the episodes forward but without any knowledge about the history of the girls on the show it just comes off as awkward when the 'strong leader' suddenly burst out crying. Also how could one of the girls go from hostage to beating up the guy in a flash... couldn't she have done that in the beginning? but overall I like the animation and the base story seems very interesting and refreshing. I just wish that they had spent at least one episode setting the whole story up, it would have allowed more people to retain their attention on the anime. The people that have seen it on other sites knock it for its slow pace. I will still be watching this though its good overall

 I don't know why, but after watching just three episodes, I feel like...Coppelion is lacking in SOMETHING. Something isn't there to give it that 'umpfh' and it needs it! I think it's pretty down-to-earth on the genre but, like, where is all the unbelievable and amazing action I was expecting? I actually want Coppelion to be something like Highschool of the Dead

 Well, that SOMETHING you're talking about....may have come up already. :P

 Man this shows dumb. "Were going to create genetically modified high school girls to send into a nuclear wasteland to find people who are for no explicable reason wandering around in hazmat suits!" I mean it's pretty much STALKER: The Anime, but jesus the execution is terrible. Cool theme songs for the OP and ED though. Love the VN style backgrounds, even if they're obviously done as a cost-saving measure. It works since the setting is pretty much a dead city. The thick outlines on the characters looks kinda crappy though. I want to like it a lot more than I do but it's just hard to take seriously at all.

I actually want Coppelion to be something like Highschool of the Dead The writers are trying and failing to create narrative tension by disseminating information really slowly per episode, but the characters being deliberately stupid and obtuse actively detracts from the ability to enjoy the setting. It just feels silly and melodramatic instead of tragic and eerie. Why would they even name them "Coppelion" and then tell us that it literally means "dolls." The writing is so ham-fisted in trying to create existential turmoil for the girls.

I'm not sure where you get the idea that people are "for no explicable reason wandering around in hazmat suits"? The reason they're in hazmat suits is obvious, and their various reasons for staying in the wasteland are explicitly explained in the anime. In fact much of the anime is dedicated to exploring each individual's personal reasons for staying. :/ How far have you even watched?

 The first three episodes and no, no one who's been in the zone has had a reasonable excuse for being there except the prison couple, and even then the entire situation was insanely melodramatic and dumb and silly with the showdown in that collapsing building when the entire situation was totally unnecessary. The lead girl having that emotional episode felt really forced and out of place with her established character so far; the goofball of the trio being the one to find the mother and daughter would've made way more sense from a narrative perspective and would've completed their earlier interaction a lot more conclusively. Her having a breakdown and it being enough to affect the mother would have made sense since there was an established connection. Then it got ramped up even further with the building collapsing right at that second because hey people gotta die or it won't be sad! Oh and the dad going off and essentially killing himself instead of being there for his daughter was just icing on the cake. I'm not saying the explanations couldn't have been reasonable or meaningful but the way it's all been written so far has been impossible to take seriously. Characters just inexplicably keep making poor decisions at every turn that lead to more melodramatic outcomes. Like glasses girl straying from the rest of the group for no real reason, being unarmed, and nearly getting killed because she split off and was unarmed. I mean that should have been one of the absolute most basic survival skills they picked up in their years and years of training; stay together. I'm guessing the original light novel was written just as poorly and the producers decided against trying to fix some of these mistakes/messes for whatever reason, but it could've been a lot more compellingly written. - Also this post and my previous probably sound a lot harsher than I intend for them to come across, it's just frustrating since the topic of what life would be like for people stranded in a nuclear hotzone in modern times would be really interesting if it was written by someone more capable. Having played the STALKER games and read A Roadside Picnic, I know there is and has been existing material that deal with the subject matter in much better ways. I mean hell, I could forgive the "interesting setting, but with high school girls!" trope if the rest of it was quality, but instead we get "supposedly highly trained experts making terrible decisions at every turn for glaring plot reasons." 

 I have not played the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, but I know there is no piece of work which is the authority on how post-apocalyptic shows are "supposed" to be written. Coppelion depicts its characters under great pressure, and it is expected that they make terrible decisions. Many other post-apocalyptic works also depict stress-induced mania in the same ways. I'm sorry that it's tragic, people die from bad decisions, and it doesn't match up to what you think a post-apocalyptic story is supposed to be; but writers are free to express their creativity in their own way in their own stories, and not copy whatever works you consider to be the authority on post-apocalyptic plight.

 Haha jesus, it's not about following some strict guidelines. Nothing in this show feels like a realistic action or reaction to what is going on.
