[Anime] What are you currently watching?
 Just started Maria Holic based on a post in the "just finished" thread. It is hilarious! I have never seen a girl get a bloody nose before. Pretty funny premise. I should get through it quickly. Quoth the wiki Maria Holic revolves around a high school girl named Kanako Miyamae, who is scared of boys and breaks out inhives if a boy touches her. During her second year of high school, she enrolls in an all-girls school hoping to find a female romantic partner. However, her ideal candidate, Mariya Shid≈ç, turns out to be a sadistic cross-dressingboy. 
 The fate of destruction is also the joy of rebirth. Candidate, Juris Doctor - 2017 - Calbob.com
