[Anime] Scare the s**t out of me. I dare you.
 Elfen Lied is one of my favorites. Not for the plot, but just for it's "I don't give a f**k" mentality. The feeling that anyone could die at any second was lovely. I only jumped once the entire series though, and I even knew it was gonna happen. It gave it an element of realism that you just don't get in any other anime. AoT was one of those type anime. Almost every series in existence, the main character and his/her friends are basically immortal. In AoT the only person who is immortal is Mikasa. Even Eren could die at any moment. That sort of suspense is what made me love them. And I have yet to watch an anime to be psychological/gorey/scarey enough to leave the images stuck in my mind.. Any help here? I need to find something that would really affect me. Now you gotta remember. I'm the kind of guy who watches Elfen Lied and laughs. Or who watches Another and gets bored by it. Who watches Death Note and hopes that Light wins (Not to say I'm the only one). I want you guys to think of the scariest, most messed up, most psychological, action thriller anime that you've ever watched. Now please keep in mind, I'm not a fan of Demon/Exorcist/Vampire, so if at all possible I'd like to avoid those. Anyways, I dare you guys to try and scare the **** out of me. After I've watched all the suggestions, I'll probably announce the one who scared me the most (for those who are interested). Though that might take me a while because I watch genre's according to my tastes that week. The person who suggests to me the scariest anime wins. So go wild, and don't hold back. 4xdblack (EDIT: Maybe this should have gone in Transcendental. Oh well, YOLO)

 I was going to recommend you some but you've already stacked them in your plan to watch list. Try reading the manga Pupa. I've not read it myself but there have been rumors.

 My top pick: MOURYOU NO HAKO Don't be fooled by the first episode which will give you the idea this si some kind of yuri romance anime. Watch ep1 all the way to the end and then continue on. Mouryou no Hako is one of the most disturbing and scariest shows I have ever watched and hands down the scariest anime I've seen. It kept me gnashing on my nails as I was perched upon the edge of my seat throughout. It's not even suspenseful anymore, it's downright terrifying. At it's core it's a detective story about four guys who have to track down a serial killer who cuts teenage girls into little pieces but beyond that it's really more of a psychological horror show. It deeply goes into the psychological effects of losing your limbs with some of the most nightmarish visuals I have seen. Moreover we also spend a considerable time inside the killer's head as well. And as the story goes on the plot becomes more and more complex but also more and more surreal and disturbing as the lines between reality and fantasy begin to blur and as a viewer half the time you're not sure whether what you're seeing is what's really happening or rather some nightmarish scene that plays out in the head of one of the many depeply troubled characters the show sports. I watched it deep into the night as I couldn't stop watching and when i finished it I was honeslty shaking a little bit. When you want to have the living daylights scared outta ya I can think of nothing better. Besides that it's also just a really grerat show with fantastic charactrs, a solid plot and amazing visuals. So there's my suggestion. Link below: http://myanimelist.net/anime/4879/Mouryou_no_Hako 
If there is a dream which takes one his whole life to find...A man should envision such a lifetime once...To be born and to then simply live for no better reason. I can't abide such a lifestyle. -Griffith
 School days. No seriously! It will leave you messed up in the end.

To most I'd say: if you like mystery and suspense, give t a go but to you I'll just say: go watch this. I'm sure you'll love it. Mouryou no Hako is a real hidden gem. And that's a little surprising actually if you see who made it. Madhouse did the production while Clamp did the character designs (don't worry this looks a million times better than Code Geass) and it was directed by the director of Aoi Bungako with the writing being done by the writer of Boogiepop Phantom. I guess sometimes a show just falls through the cracks.

I would say Myself;Yourself has two parts if I remember right that might work. Like one is more of shock/WTF-reaction/did not expect that. It's possibly close to scare in a way. Also there is part which doesn't come out of the black though so you do realize it a bit before it happens so it's more of like "oh ****, really, really?"-part. But yeah that would be closest I can say that haven't been presented here. The first part I mentioned is actually one where I got scared, but I get scared pretty easily so don't know if it will work for you. But yeah would have said school days. I'm still scarred from it.

 I don't think its scary, but it was one of my favorite manga a while ago (it also has an anime out now too, pretty new still). Its called parasyte, japanese name is kiseijuu. absolutely amazing and i loved it. Take a look at the manga or anime. guarantee you'll enjoy as i too loved elfen lied.

 Looks like my roster is gonna be: 1. MOURYOU NO HAKO 2. School days 3. Boku no Picu I'll leave the thread open for more suggestions until I watch the first episode of one of those shows. I'm still on Rainbow, and will probably watch one after that. I'm almost looking forward to it

 I don't know know why people always enjoy bringing that series up on the forum...I mean, there are minors on here as well. We are not allowed to mention hentai, why should it be acceptable to bring up a shota anime? Not to be a wet blanket or anything, but it just kind of irks me. Anyway... It's not going to scare you that bad, but have you tried watching Boogiepop Phantom? It definitely has some psychological and scary elements to it. The way the series is told is interesting because it isn't told in a linear way(think Pulp Fiction or Baccano!). You are left to figure out in what order each event happened.

I'm almost looking forward to it Hey my suggestion made the top spot! Awesome! Also, bit of topic, how do you like Rainbow? I loved it but that's also because I had already read the original manga and the adaptation was really well done. Except for the ending which diverges from the manga but in a good way because it actually has a phenonenal ending despite only adapting a small portion of the original manga. Yeah I love Rainbow. As for Boogiepop Phantom. I recommend it wholeheartedly. It's the epitome of a mind****. It has an exceedingly complex plot told in a manor that does not even approach somethin akin to linearity and there's no exposition scene anywhere. It's the only show I've ever watched that I had to watch twice in order to get some grasp on the actual story. And that's not even mentioning the deeper themes that underpin the story itself which are also really thought provoking. And yes because you're so involved with trying (and possibly failing) to keep up with the plot the otherwise dark tone and eerie atmosphere, not to mention the sometimes rather excessive gore lacks any real impact but it's still one of the scarier shows I've watched so you can give it a go for this regardless.
