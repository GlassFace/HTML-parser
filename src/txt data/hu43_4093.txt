[General Discussion] How do you drink your water? Tap, Bottled, Filtered? Why?
 I drink straight from the tap. But where I live, the water comes from a well and is filtered before it gets to me. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
