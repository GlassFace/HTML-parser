 Killing the Thinking (part 2)
 hi there, I would put more spaces in to avoid the intimidation a huge wall of text puts on the reader but you have a good flow I have to say. Here are a few things I found anyway, hope it helps would be interested in reading more. 1. More filler, like charachter thoughts as the story plays out really fast paced I feel. For example, briefly describe mothers appearance when she steps out of car to go into the house, slow it down a bit. 2. The spaced out text as opposed to the block of text. 3. Comma, full stops and general grammar. The brackets thing you use for example, also 'her parents car pull it the driveway and 'go get your overnight thinks kids!' also it's debatable as to whether an exclaimation mark is appropriate or not. Just keep editing and editing it really helps, I've edited my story on here so many times since I started it years ago, it's went through so many transformations. Sorry if that seems too harsh but best of luck with your story
