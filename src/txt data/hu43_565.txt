[Action] Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Bread Remembering Appreciation Station
 Awww no more dorky manliness for 3 months. Â Spoiler I went into Stardust Crusaders blind as I heard it was pretty much a stand alone. Might watch the first 2 parts now. With how short they were I'm surprised part 3 is getting 36, maybe 48 episodes. I know it is the the most popular arc, but are they going to go back to 12 episode segments after Part 3? Are they even going to continue after Part 3?
