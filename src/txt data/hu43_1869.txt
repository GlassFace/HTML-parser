 Happy Music!
 What song gets you up in the morning? What do you dance around your house to when no one else is around? What to you sing in the shower? I want a long list of happy music because, for some reason I find myself constantly listening to sappy sad ****. I guess it's just the emotion. When you play guitar and realize you only know two uplifting songs it's time to explore music again so let's have it!  Spoiler

 I tend to dance a lot around the house when no one is home. One of my favorite songs to dance to is Closer by Tegan and Sara. :3

 What wakes me up in the morning? Uhh... My family? My alarm? Definitely doesn't make me happy... As for dancing, I'm too lazy/unflexible/unskilled... Just click my signature for good music.

 This song doesn't make me want to dance, but it definitely makes me burst into song. And it made Spanish class fun by 4%.

It's fun to search for popular songs in 8bit form. Also, I can't say I hate that Justin Beiber song it has lots of feel goods. Though I don't really care for him. @Alexuh55 : I've actually never heard that song... lol it makes me think I should be skipping off somewhere. Happy but, maybe too happy. Like Stepford Wive happy. @MandyCandy185 : that's a really interesting way to learn spanish does it really help with remembering the words? @Ian : Where's my maracas AYAYAYAYE! I actually really..like that lol. It feels like Mexicans are going to come out of the woodworks and start dancing around my house with tacoes and sombreros. @Jellz : That seems like a really good song to get you pumped up for the day. @Setsuna-ah : Lol who doesn't love to sing along to the American Dad theme song? I secretly wish my life had a theme song sometimes. @Oh Snap : That's a beautiful song I hope it's never ruined by being used on Teen Wolf or something.

 In the morning, I can usually recall songs, their melody quite well. Physically there is no music playing in the room, but there is one in my head. Every morning. This one was todaY 
 Yes i too wake with what i call the song of the day stuck in my head Ot this is my happy song 
  Spoiler  Spoiler 
 @Elfa : That song makes me feel like I should be on vacation on an island. @WesleyV1 : Hey I can play that on guitar it's a four chord song! Still a great song anyway lol. Very uplifting. @Kuze : Is that a nod to something the band does or? I guess I don't get it.
