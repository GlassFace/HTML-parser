 You can now buy a mech
 kotaku.com/5930017 I'm at work so I can't access the website but I am reading the Boston Herald and it's in The Ticker section. The Kuratas robot starter's kit is being offered on Amazon Japan for a little more than $1,000,000. It stands nearly 13 feet tall and weighs 5 tons. Top speed is 6mph and it runs on gas. You can climb into the cockpit or control it from a smartphone with a 3G network. It responds to the operators facial expressions. It doesn't come with weaponry and some assembly is required. No website was listed in the article. Take it for what you will, but I've been hoping for this for the last 30 years.
