 Start Button Finally Returns: Wndows 8.1
 In advance of next month's Build conference, Microsoft today provided a "first look" at Windows 8.1, which includes the return of the start button. With Windows 8.1, the first major update to Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system, the start button will appear whenever you move your mouse to the bottom right of the screen in tiled (or "Metro") mode and will persist on the taskbar when in desktop mode. To make it more easily recognizable, Microsoft will replace the Start "tip" that appears on Windows 8 with the familiar Windows logo. http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2419698,00.asp Damn, about time! 

 Consistancy is the best.

 Depends on who you talk to MoSteel. I for one, appreciate the fact that Windows 8 can boot in 10 seconds and using the search on the Charm menu is by far, the best thing next to Google. In fact, Windows 8.1 is a refinement, basically meaning that there weren't any super glaring problems like previous versions where Service Packs would not only fix major problems, but fix problems that would cause irreversible damage.

 What do they mean by the start tip?

 Why do people hate vista so much? It was my favourite windows operating system of them all.

 I used 98 until I used 7. I don't think I missed much. 
 The anti-Windows 8 circle jerk is one of my favorites. I've heard about people who buy a new decked out PC but only get Windows 7 with it. The only thing is when asked they can't explain why they hate Windows 8 aside from the old regurgitated messages like "No start button..." or "It's made for a tablet, not a desktop!" Windows 8 has: *Better security. *Increased functionality in a variety of programs and games. *Higher levels of compatibility with software. *Significantly shorter start up and shut down times. *Better multimedia performance. *Higher browser performance. *Far, far, far better multi-language support. Windows 7 has: *A start button. The vast majority of people cannot think for themselves and therefore will just repeat whatever opinion they heard on the matter first. What's so hard about actually looking into something by yourself and coming to your own conclusions? It literally takes under 30 seconds to install an interface on Windows 8 and you have your precious start button back. There are several options to choose from, including some that are free and others that cost $5 or less. Windows 7 was a very well built operating system, and Windows 8 essentially built on it with a new approach. If you don't like it, you can just download an interface and have something identical to Windows 7 with better functionality. I don't say it's worth the money to upgrade to Windows 8 if you're not all that interested in it, but it's not a horrible OS to be avoided at all costs.

Windows 8 vs Windows 7 The issue is while there may be some great enhancements to the OS in the background the problem is that the shift in functionality to mirror their Tablet/Mobile OS was a terrible idea at least given that it doesn't seem as simple as it should be to run a "normal" desktop environment instead of the tablet interface. It should have been a very easy thing to change which desktop the OS boots into and one PC manufactures could set so that when shipping a standard PC it ships preconfigured to standard desktop mode and tablets to the tablet mode. This would have been a rather simple and logical way to remedy a huge design flaw. This flaw is purely that of design and failing to really consider their customers a mistake MS is repeating with the XB1 by breaking the 2nd hand market. I would love to talk more on that but I won't and will end my rant here.
