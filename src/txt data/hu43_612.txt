 @Shannon if you are still considering ASOIF please DON'T, I'll explain. I first got into the series in high school(2000) when book 3 came out, at the time it was 3 of the best books I had ever read. Then 5 years go by and we get half a book(feast for crows only has half the PoV chars and is bad), with the explanation the other half(dance with dragons) will be out shortly. Fast forward to 2011 and GRRM finally gets off his lazy ass to release book 5 because GoT was coming out and he wanted to cash in on the extra advertising. It's now 2015, the TV series is about caught up, and there is no estimate for the next book release. So since 2000 he has updated each PoV character ONCE. This will be the first thing I'm aware of that started as a book series and finishes as a TV series, which is kinda interesting but if have haven't started the books DON'T DO IT there is too much other good stuff out there. If you like darker themed stuff either First Law(Joe Abercrombie), Farseer(Robin Hobb), or Black Company(Glen Cook) are all much better choices. Better yet they are all finished so you don't have to wait 15 years for another book.
