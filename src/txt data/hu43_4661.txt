[Anime] Unique or Memorable Anime Characters
 Kei the main character from Gantz is pretty unique he cares for no one other then himself. His old friend is the only reason he tries to change... I really can't say much more without spoiing it. I agree L from Death Note is another one. He really is like batman..
