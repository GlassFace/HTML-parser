 I haven't watched anime in a while, i've been very picky about what I watched. If I were to list some favourites right now I'd say One piece, Naruto, Death Note, Monster, Rainbow Nisha, Wolf's Rain, Slam dunk, Full metal alchemist. Be sure to check these out if you haven't already, guarantee you'd love at least one of these.
