 Forum-ception
 Yes A4, I'd like to "quick reply" with the entirety of the A4 website. I've been catching this recently, where it looks like a copy of the first page ends up in the quick reply box, is this an issue on my end or what? Using Chrome Version 40.0.2214.111 Also using adblock because **** you git @ me Image here:  Spoiler 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 Saw it once myself as well. Only once so far, and I was using my phone. Was odd and irritating. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

 That's actually how big the new forum frontpage is gonna look like. Think of all the space that can be utilized for ads. Those server costs and crack addiction isn't gonna pay for itself. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro?

Those server costs and crack addiction isn't gonna pay for itself. Paused my ad-blocker because of this comment. The site looks horrible lol. Can I report new owner to a mod for advertising foreign sites and scams?

 Must be something wrong with your biorhythm. Disable adblock and go get it analyzed on-site asap.

 Not only is A4 now a run of the mill eyesore of a site, but it runs like a fat hog due to all the ads, and the facebook, Twitter, etc. **** at the top of the page makes simply clicking on 'latest posts' a ****ing chore since they load in slow as **** and move **** when they do. It's such a hassle to use the full site while on my phone.
