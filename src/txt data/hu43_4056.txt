 Katawa Shoujo - Three Stars (Piano Cover)
 I love Katawa Shoujo's OST so I thought I'd have a go at covering 'Three Stars.' This piece in particular plays during the cinematic to Shizune's route. It's probably my favourite piece from the game so I enjoyed learning it. 
 'I didn't want to learn that living meant losing.'
