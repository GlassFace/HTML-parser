 Have you ever felt like you got worse at a sport?
 I used to be so good at football. But for some reason I feel like ive gotten worse, even though my fitness has improved. I used to eat whatever the hell i want and not train at all, now even though i eat healthy, train a lot and practiced i feel worse for some reason. I should be better, ive learnt more skill and stuff and i can even around the world and stuff, when my best skill used to be rainbow flick. Ive also gotten faster, much faster but i just feel worse. Why? I just lose the ball and fail at defending when I used to be one of the best midfielders i know my age. I should be better, but im not.
