[General Discussion] Meme culture
 Okay I'm just going to jump straight to the point: I'm sick and tired of memes. Just the idea of a meme makes me roll my eyes. Most memes are like huge bandwagons waiting for every person on the internet to jump on. I see people throwing these memes into random conversation just trying to be funny when it really makes no sense at all. Even worse, when people adapt a meme phrase into their every day vernacular. I should stop myself before I continue ranting because I'd like to hear what you all have to say C: How do you guys feel about memes like advice animals, rage faces and harlem shake? Do you reference memes a lot or would you rather have your own sense of humor? If you want you can check out the video below to get a better understanding of the point I'm trying to come across.

 You win some and lose some. I don't like some of the memes but some make me laugh til I pee my pants for no reason. I'm not terribly against it I guess.

 I agree. There are a lot of things that are funny simply because they are, not because they're a meme. I dislike overly popular memes and memes that are only funny because they are popular.

 First off,... http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...4-MEME-Contest Enjoy. Might do this again this year and hopefully it won't just be me and Inferno spamming the hell out the first 5 pages. Second, most people don't use the meme in its correct context or just aren't funny. Finally, I find most people who despise memes are often boring, drab and think 'in jokes' 2 people and their cat gets constitutes as cutting edge satire or some such bollocks. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Well I hope I don't seem boring or drab to you. Just because I don't like memes doesn't mean my whole character and personality is affected.

 I use some internet memes as some actually have some worth to it. Other than that, there are others that are just ridiculous and this becomes obvious when it matches up to the people who use them, and seemingly think that it is 'cool'. I does not bother me when it is used but I will make fun of those behind the CPU screen when they look like asshats trying to be funny or tough when bringing them up out of the blue.

 Thank you, Oh Snap for a prime example of how easy it is to make a 'joke' using a meme or meme generator. Basically people use memes because they can. Now I don't want to seem like an ******* who tells people never to use memes because my opinion is fact, but I just want to spread the notion that there are funnier and more unique ways to make a joke.

 The idea of the meme may have been given a name only recently, and it may have only gained traction on the internet within the last few years, but memes are as old as human culture itself. Memes are actually really interesting in the grand scheme of things. I think what you're sick of is their abuse, not so much their existence.

I didn't think I would have to explain that but yes that is how I feel.

 You have to explain yourself a lot around here. Or at least, we appreciate you a lot more if you do. 

 Yeah I figured that. It's very hard to gain acceptance around A4. And god forbid you have an opinion. (Sorry for getting so off topic >.<)

 Most memes hit the over-saturation point so quickly due to social media that it goes from humorous to played out in about 2 days. More of something is not always better, and in fact tends to water down what made the initial event entertaining in the first place. Monkey see, monkey do ( monkey lacks creativity ). 
 Amen brotha. Don't hate the meme, hate the memeer'. Meme-erer? Whatever, I should just f*ck off.

 I HATE MEMES! I also hate the people who spam them. So like 4chan/reddit/memesites I NEVER been too. Some people I know irl say memes like no tomorrow i'm like -.- stfu ******. Some memes I have seen are pretty hilarious, I have to admit, but overall memes are stupid and = spam. By funny memes (I mean demotivationals)

 I don't hate memes, some are worth the laugh or on 9Gag - the 'like'/'thumbs up' I'm not really in and updated with memes though, some are funny, some aren't - they don't annoy me though? Maybe because they aren't stuffed in front of my face everyday XD BUT BUT BUT I do daily check up 9Gag 
 
 Also I like things that don't contain meme's but are just funny pictures and captions put together :3 Some make you look and think, DAMN! What a rich guy, hes pimped his van with lights and stuff, I've always dreamt of the day I will man up and can put light switches in my van rather than hiding in the shadows.

 Some meme's are just pure boring, people got nothing to do and posting their own made meme's. disgraceful

 I rarely use memes, and when I do I use the ones that are actually funny Memes are only really good in the best situations of course, people who ruin them use them senselessly 
 I find some hilarious when they're relevant. the Borimir meme was awesome until it started getting kicked around facebook and misused 12 times a day. Same with "I don't always." There is this girl in one of my college courses that can't seem to stop blurting them out. The professor accidentally hit forward on the power point slide a few times "That escalated quickly" Or when talking about ancient ground etchings she holds up her hands to shoulder level and says  Spoiler and people in the class will glance at her and give her that smirky half-assed laugh that says "I totally get the reference!" and I'm just like, "Wow, you guys are cool! you understand popular culture!" If nothing else, they're helpful as indicators of those that lack originality. 
 
 make your own memes. that doesn't mean taking an image macro and editting the text. 
Currently listening to: SULK - End Time I wanna fade out. 
 This one should totally become popular meme.  Spoiler

 The meme contest on here was pretty hilarious. Beel, meme's are just like anything in life, some people like them some don't. However, we can all agree that we love a good laugh once in a while. Sometimes a pretty original meme can give you that
