 Originally Posted by BuddyLee Mistborn was one of my earlier fantasy reads. Definitely one of the must-read fantasy series, as is a lot of Sanderson stuff. When you finish that I highly recommend starting The Stormlight Archives. It's probably Sanderson's best work so far, even above Mistborn. I do have Alloy of Law. I bought it while I was still trying to get my hands on The Hero of Ages, which I have finished. (Bus travel means I get through a lot of reading.) It's the first book in a shorter Mistborn-related trilogy that he wrote while finishing The Wheel of Time. He also intends Mistborn to be a trilogy of trilogies which is pretty cool since I loved the first one. The Alloy of Law and it's sequels is not part of that original set of trilogies, only meant as a side story. The Vin story set in the past, 2nd Trilogy to be set in a time similar to 20th Century Earth and the third to be a futuristic science fiction story. It'll be interesting to see how he evolves it. I will take you up on that suggestion though and read The Stormlight Archives. I looked it up and it does look promising. I like him better than Hobb now.
