[Comedy] Oreimo 2 - Page 2
 Season 1 is good, season 2, first like 5 episodes are s*it, and yah I hate Kirino...Kyousuke is another matter where I hate/don't but yah the whole family is a mess and I agree with you that their family is sick. Kyousuke is the b*tch of the whole family, and I hope Kuroneko can fix that in him else season 2 is going to be a bust.

 Season 2 has been mediocre so far, but it's starting to pick up with quite well.

She's hitting her brother and throwing plates and everyone is okay with it? Sick family. I'd stopped watching after the fake boyfriend thing but if Kuroneko is going to be featured, I might check out a few more episodes. You're going to want to watch the most recent episode. Trust me :3 

 ... I F*CKING knew it! ... I really can't believe I am still watching this show, it's utter bull s*it now.

It would be kinda dumb if they were just all lovey dovey till the end. If you saw that coming though, you probably know why it is happening. Hopefully there is a nice resolution to all this. Otherwise, this season will be a huge disappointment.

I know exactly what's going to happen, and frankly both of them are idiots...well I kind of lost my respect for Kuroneko...I really wish it would have been lovey dovey, that would have saved the season, but...I really think the writer of this manga--cause that's where it originated--has no idea how to do a good story. There are some good parts and everything up till the end of this latest episode was good even with the foreshadowing...but he/she has no idea how to write a neat and polished story. But both Kirino and Kyousuke are idiots...the only one that I still respect for is now Saori and pretty much all the other girls that haven't gotten involved with the idiots.

 It's not Kuronekos fault at all, she's not really an idiot she just is trying to be a good friend. It showed when she Asked Kirino to play the game and Kirino simply refused. She knew that being Kyosukes Boyfriend would not allow them to have a strong friendship. The title of the next episode intrigues me somewhat, but I feel as if the Relationship between Kuroneko and Kyosuke is not over. 

 ^ I understand that, it just annoys me that she's going this far...although your point is probably true as well. We'll just have to wait till the next episodes that follow.

 Don't get me wrong though Mo, the episode was fantastic up until that last part, and I almost through my Television out of my window. 

 The biggest shame is that it was an excellent episode, easily one of the best of the series, until the end. Hinata-chan was hilarious and Kuroneko was adorable and quirky. As a character, she is so much better and more interesting than Kirino that it's not even funny. I hope she comes to her senses, or someone else makes her rethink her decision. If it ends with her bowing out then I'll be seriously pissed off. It will be like I've completely wasted my time with this anime.

 Freaking anime...as I had thought, this anime is so painfully oblivious. I have no idea why I get so frustrated with it. F*ck it either way, it passes the time even though it's practically s*it. I can honestly say I don't like Kuroneko as much as I use to. Also I hate both Kyosuke and Kirino. I never thought I could be so pissed at an anime, this is way worst then what I felt about C3, way, way worst.

 Unfortunately Mo, my liking for Kuroneko has also decreased, pretty much because she was using Kyousuke. I thought the episode was emotionally good, but Overall, I just do not even know anymore. I really just want the next 6 episodes to Fly by and we can have the ending because in reality we are in a downward spiral with this anime. 

 That was probably the last episode of this anime I'll watch. I got to see Kuroneko in a cat-maid costume, at least, and it kind of hinted that Kyousuke intends to pursue her. A lot of the rest of the anime was creepy as hell, though, and it was so goofy how they they were yelling weird stuff in public and no one even looked. Also, Kirino was almost bearable this episode, so why ruin that? Hated, hated, that it ended up focusing on her at the very last, however, when it should have been about Kuroneko and Kyousuke. You don't cry over a girl, end up over at her house, and then stare at your sister. Next episode looks like it's going back to being fixated on Kirino, so I'm just going to pretend the series ended with this episode. I think I'll be happier that way.

 Sometimes, I think I watch the anime just for Ayase-chan...If I didn't already have a waifu...hehe.. But, seriously, every time Ayase is on screen I HNNG about 7 days off my life. Kawaii as sh*t. But, I don't mind where the anime is going, in fact I'm happy he's not with Kuroneko, the show is called Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai not Ore no Kouhai ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai--which is actually a spin-off sorta deal. All in all--I just wanna say TRUCK THE OTHER OREIMO GIRLS! AYASE-CHAN ALL THE WAY  Spoiler

 I have no problem with Ayase, she is Yandere Moe haha. 

 I get a lot of laughs from this show, i watched it in the wrong order though i saw up to episode 10 on crunchyroll and then found out there was a season 1 
 Kuroneko...I'm sorry I will never doubt how great of a person you are ever again. This episode made me appreciate Kuroneko a lot more. And once again another good episode in my opinion.  Spoiler Kirino and Kyousuke have some kind of Sibling relationship and it's clear Ayase loves Kyousuke. 

 LOVELY MY ANGEL AYASE-TAN. God I love Ayase's character. Especially love the part when she starts stabbing Kyousuke with the sheathed knife  Spoiler
