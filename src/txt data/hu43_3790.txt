 Always need to play close attention to Durarara. There's always so much happening that one misread and BOOM you're done. They skipped very far ahead at the end but it seems we'll get that back in the next episode. Those twins tho...they drive me crazier every week haha. Also they have Celtys Money and then just gave Shinra 20000 yen so practically my man is working for free. Is interview had me rolling though. 

 The twins about to charge that bartender interest for covering the medical bill. They are going to be a powerhouse in a few episodes. I can see them getting rich and powerful and causing all types of problems for big bro izaya 
 Dude, I loved all the character interaction and meet-ups in this episode. This cast is banging, and I'm really excited to see where this story of non-humans and humans goes as the city twists their fates together in ecchii, violent, funny, and mysterious ways. 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils?

 You know my only complaint of this series is the constant use of the same classical music. Fur de lise Beethoven right? I mean a little variety wouldn't hurt....... But I loved it when the anime club gang tried to say celty was a  Spoiler tsundere! Have we seen the leader of the yellow scarves this season yet? I don't think we have. Anyway I loved the headless dude. Great stuff

 Can't wait for it!!! 
 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses. Beside you as you like softly down, I will be until I hear the words "Checkmate". ~Sebastian Michaelis ~ Individual 4 ~ A4's Greatest Villain <Right Here Lmao 
 Poor Izaya wasn't invited to the Hot pot thingy!! HOW DARE THOSE BASTARDS NOT INVITE HIM!! So Aoba is planing something... Didn't I say he gives out Izaya vibe?? Oh Mikado like danger hahahaha! GO MIKA-CHAN!!! BECOME BADASS DOLLARS LEADER AND IZAYAS WIFE HAHAHAHAHAHA!!

 After gushing about her affection for Shinra, Celty then used her black symbiote to stop those bikers cold. Tall Russian guy to the rescue and the cavalry's already on their way - did I mention that the Idol/Special Makeup FX Artist/Serial Killer was also some back-up as well?! Too awesome. Oh boy, the Emo-Deadpan-Face couple are having sad conversations, which just adds to their personalities of being somber - but they're still going to fuq later. So the twins and the Russian sushi gang devised that Duffel Bag job for Celty?! Brilliant, also Egor is a boss. Shinra x Celty is too cute, I LOVE this vanilla. Izaya's going to have days off? What? Who exactly is Yodogiri, and what did he do to the Idol/Special Makeup FX Artist/Serial Killer girl? Damn, he smiled at that ****...creepy, but cool - and new kid saw him do it! Both the new kid who likes the twins and Izaya are planning some nasty things, while it appears that the Mob Bosses are actually trying to get rid of a serious threat - being Yodogiri. This episode was a bit mellow and served more for character interaction, but it was still awesome and had decent story development.

 So the questions that need to be answered are; 1. What are those mob looking guys up too? 2. What is Izaya up too? 3. Who is Aoba's brother? (They mentioned Iizumi I believe and he said he didnt want to be reminded of his brother) We know what Aoba wants, to start another war. I still like him but I kinda had that feeling we couldnt trust him.

I'm not used to nonlinear stories like this. I enjoy the show but it makes it harder for me to follow . Yeah maybe I'm not quite as tuned into this as I should be. But I still enjoy it. I! Just not too wrapped up in the long term plot.

I still like him but I kinda had that feeling we couldnt trust him. My theories since my dear Yoda wants them 1. What do all mob guys want money and power... 2. Probably what he was up to in season one. Start a war and awaken Celtys head because he thinks she is something who brings war fighter to heven (I can't remember the name) 3. Not sure about the brother, but maybe the brother did something to betray Aoba and now Aoba hates him...

 Thanks j4sm1n4. Though wasn't the head deal resolved last season? Isn't that the yellow scarves leaders girlfriend?

And Saki that little ***** doesn't have Celtys head ( Also Saki doesn't deserve Masaomi!). Izayas secretary(who has a crush on her little brother) had Shinra perfomr platic surgery on Anris friend who was almost killed by Izayas secretaries brother because Anris friend was stalking him and now her face looks like Celtys head and she is dating her obsession. No one knows Izaya has real Celtys head. Hope that makes sense....

 Does Shinra know he made the teenage girl look like Celty, or has he never seen Celty's real face before? I'm still always a bit irritated to see the guy who almost brutally killed the girl he's now dating...man, that entire story sub-plot was just psychologically messed up. Regarding the mob bosses, they mentioned that they have to stop Yodogiri or at least find the guy, so that's their main objective.

 Oh so those guys are looking for that little girl who tried to kill Shizuo... somehow this situation will probably be Izayas doing once again... Because they hired Celty to find that girl I don't think they wanna hurt that little girl so my guess is that she is probably family of someone important.Also once again we can see how obsessed that woman is with her little brother... Also about that new gang who is after Dollars I don't think that was Izayas doing for some reason... This is only a guess but I think this time it was Aoba who sent that gang on Dollars... 
  Spoiler "If the king does not lead, how can he expect his subordinates to follow?"
 I SAW SAMURAI FLAMENCO SCENE. Rocky Chicago got REKT by Shizuo. That little girl has got to be some mob boss's daughter or something, why else would she want to kill Shizuo? I love how the Dollars have their reputation inflated so much by gossip that they're like this bad-ass street gang of thugs, when in reality the actions of only a few key individuals produce so much. Yeah, now Celty's involved with the loli, and she got that job from a mob boss...the little girl is totally affiliated with the mob. Celty got beheaded...not really effective though, who is this Sherry LeBlanc ***** though that wants to hurt Celty?!

 Well obviously celty will find the girl at home with shinra. I got that much. And we finally saw mikado! He was on vacation?!??? Or hiding out? Isn't that gang really the yellow scarves and this bandaid guy is subbing for mikado? That's what i thought at least....

 Yoda... I think u mixed two people up... Mikado has brown hair and is leader of Dollars while Masaomi has blonde hair and is leader of yellow scarves...
