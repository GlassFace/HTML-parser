 Do we have any Rockers in here?
 I listen to mostly rock and rap, but will listen to anything...........but pop As for rock bands: Linkin Park Three Days Grace Three Doors Down System of a Down Serj Tankian A little Nickelback Shinedown Skillet Rise Against One OK Rock Asian Kung Fu Generation Hikari Shuuyou (Hikarisyuyo) who makes rock songs with the use of a vocaloid A friend of mine introduced me to rock, starting with Linkin Park's Numb, which is awesome. On that, I got Pandora, and every one of the others just fell in over time I'm not exactly hardcore, but I do listen to it a lot On AKG, One OK Rock, and Hikarisyuyo, I got into the JRock part after hearing Rewrite (AKG) pop up on Pandora after all that time, and it reminded me of Full Metal Alchemist, which is one of my absolute favorite Animes
