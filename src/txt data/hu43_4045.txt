Dude, come on. Have you not read the forum rules of advertising on A4? Please read our Rules and the list of legal anime streaming websites in our FAQ - Shannon Apple.
 This is one of the better fillers this show has done. I'm actually more interested in these chunnin exams than I am in the main story since I read the manga and already know the ending 
 No advertising streaming sites please. http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...aming-Websites http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...s-and-Bannings
