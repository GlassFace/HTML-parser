 "What Anime Is This?" Helpful tips for finding the answer to your question:Provide as much of a written description as possible. Outline everything you can remember, including when the anime may have been released, the setting, the characters, and other notable features.Pictures help a ton. If you have a picture or snapshot from a show and you're interested in checking it out post it here and someone should be able to identify it for you.Be patient. You may not get a response right away but that doesn't mean you never will. Reposting requests is considered bad form at best and spam at worst, and spam can result in infraction points and ultimately a ban.Be civil and polite, people respond more reliably if you're nice about this sort of thing. Good luck and happy hunting! PS: The image above if from "School Rumble".
