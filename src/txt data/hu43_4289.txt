[Anime] Why do people run with their arms to their sides at a low angle in anime's?
 I first noticed this while watching naruto. I then realized they do it in black butler. I've also spotted it in infinite stratos. Is it to imply they are going really fast? Or is it some nod to some ninja or martial arts technique I don't know about? Or is it just something unique to anime that has no real reason behind it? I'm sure they do this in loads of other anime's. These are just ones I've noticed it in. Thanks for any insight. Sample from imgarcade of naruto running:  Spoiler

 If you mean running with their arms held backwards then I suspect it is supposed to indicate they are streamlining their bodies to reduce wind resistance although I seriously doubt the mechanics of running works that way. Otherwise we would see this technique in competitive events. What I wonder about is the girls running with their arms forward holding their hands up in front of themselves. That just looks silly!

I don't know about any dance, but Finfan did make a point, which only works in anime physics/bio.

 @finfan - I see your point about aerodynamics. At least in the toon world @jugger - yep Thanks. If anyone has any timeline on this technique I'd be interested. Thanks.

 Because it is easier to draw?

 I'm pretty sure it's a total shinobi thing. The teenage mutant ninja turtles do the same thing. I think it's so that you can have a weapon in your hands without the risk of slashing something or dropping your weapon and still being in the position to attack whilst running.

 It reduces air resistance without flailing your arms around, like an airplane. That's my hypothesis anyway.

Hmm I haven't watched the 80s cartoons in a long time so I couldn't say I remember that. I haven't seen the newer cartoons either. Shinobi eh? I only know that name from an old genesis video game I believe. Thanks everyone for suggestions.

 shinobi i.e. Ninjas. But I ran this way before just to see what would happen. Really it just boosts acceleration due to the angle you're running at. But for overall speed it sucks. 
 I'm getting a good chuckle out of this thread. The stupid ninja run you see in anime is simply an artistic choice. Originally Posted by 4xdblack Really it just boosts acceleration due to the angle you're running at. lol what is this nonsense?

But for overall speed it sucks. No it doesn't. There's a reason people move their arms when running (and walking), and it's not because it looks cool, which is the only reason you see shinobi doing it in anime. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

 OK I guess the consensus is its mainly a ninja thing. Though as mentioned I have seen it used it other action anime's beside ninja ones. Thanks everyone.
