[Personal Life Discussions] School and Travelling
 Well,i always loved PE. i know it's casual, but i enjoyed runnin and sweatin my ass off. Other than that, foreign languages, we learned english and german, and i ruled both of those Had plans of going to college and than trying to go study abroad and all that, but i kinda quit with no good reason whatsoever after a year and a half. Now i kinda regret it, but on the other hand it was an uninteresting economics program so to hell with it
