 Known Bugs - Page 2
 It's taken me a good hour to make this thread which means I need to sleep. But before I do, there are some bugs and things that will be worked on throughout the next couple of days. If you come across anything unusual please post it here. It may be something we're already aware of or something we've completely missed. Either way it would be a great help. Thanks. 
''Let's eat Grandma!'' or, ''Let's eat, Grandma!'' Punctuation saves lives. Use it. Save a life.
