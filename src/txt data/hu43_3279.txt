[Review] Legend of zelda thread!
 http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/.../?mod=yahoo_hs That should interest a few of us here. I loved the 80s cartoon that aired on the Super Mario Bros Super Show. If they could get a show with that kind of spirit and reverence for the original zelda game I think a live action show could work. COULD work mind you. But then again Netflix originals have had a great deal of success haven't they?
