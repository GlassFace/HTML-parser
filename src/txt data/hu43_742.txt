[General Discussion] Whats the story behind your profile?
 Whatever part you wanna talk about. For example, where did you get your profile picture from? What's the signature from? Who made it? Things like that.

 This pic, pretty self explanatory. I like NaruHina and I want Sakura to die. My sig, is something I found, but am making a new version soon.

 I am a romantic that loves nature and cherishes life. Just like life and nature, people are always changing, so a biography would always be changing as well. I am too lazy to update it so often. My quote is to encourage kids to stop letting baggage of the past and worries of the future to tie them down in the present where it really matters. My success rate is 0%. Everything else are references to a novel of mines. My avatar and signature are Lollipop Sweets from Ar Tonelico 2: Melodies of Metafalica, and I made them from capturing the song magic on screen.

 Not much special about it, just a collection of characters that I've taken a liking to. An unorganized, irrational, collection of things that each reflect me or at least my affinities. It's really more telling than I intended it to be, now that I look at it. 
 
 My SUPER BFF Lu The Great Space Pirate (who's name changes every week) sends me signatures. I don't ask for them or anything. Conversation goes something like Lu: OH BY THE WAY I RANDOMLY MADE YOU A SIG Lu: HERE YOU GO http://imgur.com/banner.jpg Ferret: OMG THIS IS THE BEST Ferret: LOL THIS IS PERFECT YOU PRETTY MUCH READ MY MIND *caps lock maintained for accuracy Current version is from the best scene in Strike Witches:  Spoiler Strike Witches is a great show that everyone should watch. Nobody ever complains about it or drops it or hates on it.

 The reason for the question mark is that as my name implies. I am random around people I know and sometimes a little too silly. So the question mark means I am not predictable. As for My signature. My current one was made by Fawxii who I am sure is still around somewhere. But when I change sigs its just something about it I like be it an anime or the colors or something.

 I drew my avatar! I was putting off studying for a huge biology exam one night, and decided to do a cartoon rendition of myself (since it was around Christmas time and all). My signature is what it is because I'm a big Inuyasha fan.

 Well I love kingdom hearts ever since I was a kid I grew up watching all the good Disney movies like toy story, Hercules, jungle book etc not this crap they have nowadays lol anyway it is a big part of my childhood and since I still act like a kid I like it hehe. 
 Well basically I played alot of video games, (still do actually LOL) so I just randomly put different pics of games I like in my avatar and signature. Most of them are older games because I have a nostalgia factor about them. Hopefully I give some of the members the same feeling when they see some of the pics I put up. Currently I have Breath of Fire 3, before that I had Super Contra, before that I had Skyblazer, and before that I had Codename Viper.....I think in that order o_O. 
  Spoiler VIDEO GAME: Pokemon Black, Silent Hill 3, Yoshis's Island 2 ANIME:Chaos Head, Heaven's Lost Property, City Hunter, Aquarion Evol MANGA:Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tale, Toriko, One Piece

The avatar and signature I'm using as of this post are official concept art from Nausicaa and some fan art for Fate/Zero respectively. The full image for the avatar can be found here and the full image for the siggy can be found here. I like the avatar because it's a really great visual depiction of Nausicaa's character without resorting to cliche. She's got a look of tired determination on her face, like she's been doing **** all day and finally had a chance to sit down. She's dirty, a little unkempt, but still radiant and defiant. Superb. The siggy picture is just pretty and I like the romantic idealism behind knights and their duties (not so much real, historical knights and how they worked). 

 My avatar came from myanimelist, and my sig came from deviant art with a small size adjustment in photoshop . 
 well, this current nic I'm using is a fresh one that's only been used here. the old nic I used to use has been under constant assault of a troll as of late, so I don't even want to mention it here, as google may pick it up, lead the said troll here, and just cause a bunch of drama and problems. I chose this particular nic, because I'm canadian and my name is Dan. my sig(as mentioned in another thread) is just a picture I took while in banff, and I just chopped it(quickly). same as my avatar. nothing amazing or groundbreaking. 

 My avatar is the only known photo of the only member of the one-man band, Moëvöt. He was a member of the legendary Black Legions. The Black Legions were a conglomeration of black metal groups in France in the 1990's. They were extremely secretive about their music and what they did so very little is known about them. Moëvöt was the most mysterious as his true name was never known and after the Black Legions disbanded, he disappeared and has not been seen since. My signature is the cover of the second album by the band Mütiilation, Remains of a Ruined, Dead, Cursed Soul. It is an image of an ancient cathedral with piles of corpses in it. The image represented the death of our humanity. Mütiilation also belonged to the Black Legions, but outlasted the other groups because he was kicked out early on for unknown reasons.

 not much story on my profile. i do like grell sutcille though. 
 Avatar: My fave sniper from Valkyria Chronicles. Sig: Rei Ayanami, was a sega fan, love emo chicks and I used to pretend I was a ninja in the vein of Ralph Hamburger of The Real Ultimate Power in order to troll these forums. @Pass_the_M is my twitter/steam ID. Everyone thinks its a reference to Molly but actually it's a inside joke about the time my friend told me to chug a bottle of Southern Comfort and I convinced him to let me just pass the M. 
 Nice guys are the reason you can't have guy friends. Sowy @Pass_the_M
 My signature isn't awesome like everyone else's, lol, but my profile picture is something I myself drew in Paint Tool Sai. In his full version he has this caption that says 'I Loves This Song!'

 My username was supposed to be Beelzeneff (A cat puppet thing from Ouran High School Host Club) but I made a spelling mistake and got Beelzineff. I kept it this way because it looks better. My profile pic is Heine from this manga I really like, 'Dogs; Bullets+Carnage'. I wanted a lesser-known character as my icon. My sig was made by DynaBlade and it's of Alucard. When I first joined this site, I was really into Hellsing.

 My Signature Picture is from Konachan.com. Its a Image board of sorts....kind of. Basically a photobucket that is JUST for anime wallpaper. Then the member mentioned above it was the guy who made it into a sig for me. My Avitar is a picture of my Television I took while bleach was on! My user name is the name of my favorite mech in the world. From Zoids series and the name itself is pretty kick ass and extremely popular world wide. Almost no where exists a forum, Email, Video game characters name in a MMO where the name is not already taken by now. So I got lucky here. I used to be Maja or Maha as I thought it was spelled with a J like Baja California. Character name from .hack/sign when I first started. I was gonna be a wonderful awesome member. gonna be cool and I made tons of cool posts and helped a lot of people but then I decided to change my name to shadow fox, Make really bad posts, Make others angry at me intentionally and then decide to do nothing for no one. Just because its funny. Well anyway. Other then that last bit. That is my profile...thingy. stuff...whatever.

 It's gang related. I hard a hard life growing up and was a member of the Blood Gang. In that Gang, my nickname was "Red Dragon" I've had this name for over ten years and plan on keeping it forever. It is a reminder of my past sins and the hardships I went through. 

 If you play kirby, you'll notice my username. Yep, it's one of the boss in kirby game, which I had difficulties to beat (when I played it when I was 6-7 years old, maybe). I hate it very much that I remembered the name, and somehow it had been my eternal username since who knows when. My avatar and my self-made signature is Tohka Yatogami from Date A Live. Not much to be explained about this, I just like her.

I suppose you'd TOS, this if you saw it.  Spoiler His eyes are blue and they call him white but...you get the picture. OT: There is no story behind my profile, as mines seem to be impulsive and random. It changes often depending on how I feel about it.

 I`m a cat from an another forum (fantasy one) and I just googled cat and found that lolZ
