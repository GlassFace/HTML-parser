[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Fantastic show, and a cliffhanger ending to the season! Valvrave and Crime Edge both turned out to be real risk takers and surprisingly beautiful epic shows. Can't wait for the next season! I hope Crime Edge gets theirs in the fall as well. They also had a Season 2 teaser which makes me think a lot of preparation has already been put into it.
