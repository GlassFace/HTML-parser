 New to anime
 Big hint- go to YouTube and watch the many videos where the people suggest their favorite anime series, and believe me, there are hundreds of these videos, like 10 best Romance animes, etc., it's easy to find these videos too. Also, try visiting an online anime video website, or manga site, they will have hundreds or series plus a description of the series. Good kid's anime, (ie tame, little sex) would be Digimon, Cardcaptor Sakura, Zatch Bell, Sailor Moon and Hikaru No Go. sexier, start out with To Love Ru. Uresei Yatsura is fun to watch, and like To Love Ru, has the sexy space hotties. Fun and delightful would be Ah! My Goddess or Da Capo. here's a good one you can try- Karin, about a cute vampire girl who produces blood instead of sucking it out! The World God Only Knows is very good, as well as Chobits. Please! Twins and Please! Teacher are fun too, as well as the sexy DearS. Akikan, Squid Girl, Midori Days, Chunyibo and Jinsei are really funny and fun to watch. Don't limit yourself by watching anime on regular TV either, they show the most popular anime basically but I find those series to be boring, search out lesser known series like I My Me Strawberry Eggs or Ginban Kaleidoscope because they are great series with good stories.
