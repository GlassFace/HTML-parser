 How can we improve Extended Discussion? - Page 2
 ED is largely a joke at the moment, most folks who post there are prone to post more out of passion than good sense leading to threads being derailed and point-by-point rebuttles for a dozen pages. This is not a healthy forum at all, so how can we go about improving it? Post your thoughts on the subject as well as suggestions for improvement please.
