 [EVENT] Site banners
 Dimensions: are 1000 x 200 Theme: Spring 2014 anime Format: Jpeg. - There is no point in uploading massive png files to the site as they take too long to load. Theme: Again, You may submit a banner of any anime that you want, but I am looking for banners of 2014 anime for the spring season for the next rotation to keep it current. Staff will choose the best 20 or so (more if we have a high standard) and they will all be put up in the next rotation. Please use the bannerage sticky to look for advice on new banners if you feel you need some help rather than posting 100 versions in here. XD. People are usually pretty helpful. Good luck!

 Do you RP, or are you interested in learning? Join our Role Player's Society here on A4. Would you like a baseball bat to shove up your ass along with that stick? You're a mod, please act like one A4 is on FACEBOOK

 This thread is re-opened for submissions. These banners will go up after the Valentine ones come down.

 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses. Beside you as you like softly down, I will be until I hear the words "Checkmate". ~Sebastian Michaelis ~ Individual 4 ~ A4's Greatest Villain <Right Here Lmao
