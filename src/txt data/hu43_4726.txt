[Anime] School Days = Great!?
 To be fair the only good thing about School Days was the ending, because it ended. I like the idea of a dark ending or using a "bad end" since it's a visual novel but, the joke gets old when people suggest it to others as a troll. It's been going on for what like ... I don't even know at least 5 years now come up with a better one please. That's just to the people that troll others. If you honestly liked the anime cool, we all have our opinions.
