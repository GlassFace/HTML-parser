[Manga] Praise a series you disliked and criticize one you enjoyed
 Also, use spoiler tags. Enjoyed Criticism-Hunter x Hunter manga  Spoiler Art for obvious reasons. Bomber was a horrible main villain in reality but the arc was exceptionally written so it sort of covered that up. I used to even think he was a strong villain. Kite never got a distinguished role. In all his 'fights' he would either solo or get crushed (well the one lol). We never got to see him at his brink. Killua's butler shouldn't have been able to stand toe to toe with Hisoka even if he was weaker and the manga showed that. It's clear in the beginning that Hisoka > Illumni, so are we supposed to think Butler ~ Illumni? Killua's sister is a concept worse than Dragonballs. I hope she dies if the manga continues and quick. Dropping Kurapika and Leorio for the last 2 arcs. Granted, they got a bright spotlight in the Spider arc. Leorio had some cool moments in the Zodiac arc I guess, but still.. Gon's humanitarianism is very unstable throughout the series, especially last few arcs. I don't really care which side of the fence he's own, but pick one. Praise Dislike-Fairy Tail  Spoiler Art is consistently good throughout the series. Fanservice is usually placed nicely until you get to the bs obvious lolishit. I usually hate fanservice about 95% of the time so I was surprised by that. Dragon aspect was cool in the beginning. Cool side characters like Laxus. Your turn.
