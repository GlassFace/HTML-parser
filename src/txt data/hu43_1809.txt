 Saroo Brierley, Lost Indian Boy, Finds Mother Using Google Earth 25 Years Later
 We've all spent hours mindlessly trawling through Google Earth, looking for underground military bunkers that aren't supposed to be there, but then why are there still mysterious mounds laid out in a semi circle in that former Soviet republic? Hmmm. But every now and then, Google Earth can be more than just a distraction. The technology giant has unveiled an ad which tells the story of how an Indian-born Australian man used Google Earth to find his hometown and birth mother, 26 years after he was separated from them by chance. Saroo Brierley's story made global headlines last year but Google has leveraged his journey to tell the human side of Google Earth in a three-minute online video.
