I Want To Submit Avatars! How Do I Do That? Simply reply to this thread with whatever you'd like to submit. If you're submitting numerous avatars try to keep them organized so users can easily navigate through your collection. You're free to either edit and maintain one mega post with all your avatars in it or make new posts each time you want to submit something new. Keep this important prerequisite in mind, thought: Note: The maximum size of your custom image is 150 by 250 pixels or 34.2 KB (whichever is smaller). If you make an avatar that's too big no one can use it. Don't be a dummy! Check your dimensions and file sizes! If you can't seem to compress your avatars then try using an image converter (like this one). That's it! Happy avatarin'!
