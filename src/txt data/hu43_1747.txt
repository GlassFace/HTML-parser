[Personal Life Discussions] Plans for Halloween?
 What are your plans for halloween? (^_^) I usually treat halloween like any other day but this year I´m thinking of what I should do. I wanna do something funny, any ideas? 
  Spoiler 

 My plan is to go to a cafe after work or hide in my room, so I would not have to give out candy.

 I'm going to put on a mask and a really bad wig, run around the neighborhood and (to quote my dad) "ruin a bunch of kid's Halloween"

 Be a poorly dressed Skeleton and create chaos and destruction.... 
Balance.... I'm losing it.....The ground beneath does not exist.... If this isn't nice, then I don't know what is....  Spoiler  Spoiler "The whole story has it that as we go through life, we really don't change.... We just become more of the same.... You look around you as the years go by and it seems a very valid premise.... People don't change.... As a matter of fact most of us resist change very strongly.... Yet change is a sure thing.... The only variable rate.... Slowly read as evolution and fast as revolution...." 
 Make a large halloween creepy buffet, dress up the kids, go trick or treating at like 4 (bs nighttime was so much better) check candy, hang with kids, say happy aniversary, goto bed. 
 Be like all the cool kids and go to the store, buy candy then brag about how much i got lol.

Only to be jacked by an OG like me, I'll be waiting. @OP: Dress like classic Dennis Rodman, that'd be funny. I'm gonna be Michael Jordan, wanted the jersey anyway, so... two birds and all that. Might post pics of it later. =] 
 There are several things i do. Early on i sit on the counter in the kitchen with the lights off so i can see people outside. When someone comes up to knock i open the door just before they know. It freaks them out. There is a nice and useful bush for me to hide in outside my front door, so i can jump out at people. For the past few years, i have broken into one of my friends' houses after they go to sleep and i wake them up by standing over them with a fake knife and my face covered in blood. I am still thinking of ideas, doing stuff like this makes me laugh so much. I do not do costumes though.

 Going trick or treating with my lil sis {I'm going as Dorothy from that movie Wizard Of Oz} 
 Lock the doors, Turn off the lights and clean the egg of the windows in the morning ... Ah, the life of a wallflower is good but lonely one... 
 For Halloween night, I will probably be working. But as for the weekend before Halloween, I will be attending my city's annual midnight showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I have been going for every year for the last three years. Crazy stuff. I just hope this year I can take someone with me because it's much more fun with someone else. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OPossum | Homestuck
 I got an awesome pokemon Costume. I am gonna make it myself. First I need to grab a small square piece of cardboard. Than I will tape that to my chest. Write DITTO on the front of it for the world to see. PRESTO~ My ditto Costume.

 No no that is not how you do it, you have to transform into everybody you see! Now that would be scary...

 I hate Halloween... If you want to be scary, wait till a lot of kids line up at your door, then kill one of them. (Helps you legally if you know the kid and he just pretends to be dead)

(Helps you legally if you know the kid and he just pretends to be dead) Yeah I'm pretty sure that will result in some people wanting to play a "trick" on you... And, shouldn't you love it? All the chicks wearing the revealing fantasy outfits? Seems your cup of tea, maybe I'm wrong. 
 Originally Posted by Mister All the chicks wearing the revealing fantasy outfits? I wish i had this. Everybody where i live goes for no costume at all. The few that do have a costume just wear a sheet so who knows what gender they are. It is definitely more fun to scare people who hate halloween. Pured if i was near you, i would sneak up to your door with a bunch of kids, then when you pretend to kill one of them, i will kidnap you!

 We don't really celebrate Halloween over here in Australia. It's more of an American thing with the whole candy give outs and outfits.

 Im just gonna run around the house in pajamas while eating candy like every other year....... 

 Meh, i'm not really into Halloween. I'll probably just hang out with some friends and see what they feel like doing, or just stay in eating candy and watching scary movies all night by myself. Sounds boring..huh? Lol. Oh well, it's usually treated like just another day to me anyway...

 Nothing for free, except giving out candy to children 

 Well just like any other day I will be sitting here, browsing A4. Maybe watch some anime, perhaps a nap.
