 Hard drive/disk malfunction?
 It's a windows 7 pc 64 bit, not a laptop. It's in a workable state just that lots of things have been tampered with and deleted which like you said are prob not restorable anymore. I'm not sure if it would still crash if I opened up games or certain programs. i'm kinda of not, and I doubt the DOS will fix it after disk checks and the DLG not being able to run.
