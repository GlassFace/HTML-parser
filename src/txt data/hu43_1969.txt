 Fall Season Discussion
 If there's a thread already like this I haven't seen it, just though a general thread among all the specific ones was a good idea It's about 5-6 episodes into most of the shows this season, and wanted to see peoples thoughts on the shows and how they thought they compared to each other. If you wanna post the shows you've watched this season, your favorites among them, why they're your favorites, the shows that you find enjoyable but nothing really to special about and the ones you've dropped and why. I think it could lead to some good discussion and hopefully not an arguement. Feel free to post how your thoughts change as the season continues Obviously don't talk about specific things that happen in a show that you liked or disliked, atleast not outside of spoiler tags, and try to label them as somebody might get confused about which show the spoiler is about You might wanna discuss a few shows in more detail, but not everybody is watching every show so just think before you post something (Will post my thoughts when I wake up if there is any post by then or it hasn't been closed for some reason as the op is already large enough) 
Trying my best to get to know people
