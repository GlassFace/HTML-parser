 A4 Skin v1.0
 I've been messing with this skin for more than a year now, and I think all things considering (vBulletin updates that changed some stuff), it got to where I wanted the style to be as a first release. If it's not being set for some reason. On the bottom of the forums, there is a dropdown that you can set to "A4 Skin v1.0" - I've fixed many missing border colors and set them to the proper light grey. - I've removed shadows from just about everything except inside blog, profile and social group pages. - I've removed vBulletin's built in log-in and navbar for my own custom one - I've expanded your personal information to have your avatar and other things in there however, the "other things" are not yet showing. I've turned those off in fear that they will destroy the forums. - Things to come: --- Article stuff --- Hot Threads stuff --- Your most recent posts Basically, the idea is to take the old sidebar and make it even more personalized and posting it here for you to see in one place anywhere. I removed the search button. It can go to hell. >=(
