 Anime Character Look-A-Like!sebastian michaelissebastian michaelissebastian michaelis
 Here, you can put characters you think look a like. Ex. Sebastian Michaelis from Kuroshisuji  Spoiler Hiroki Segawa from Witchblade  Spoiler Note: On the title I have no idea why it says.. Just ignore itsebastian michaelissebastian michaelissebastian michaelis 
 This doesn't fit the writer's block section though, this is more a general anime discussion and even then, A4 doesn't do threads like this. Unless the rules have changed but they are kind of unspoken rules. Will up to the mods to decide.
