 What do people around you think about you watching anime ?
 First of I don't really care what anyone thinks and neither should any of you. Surround yourself with friends that won't judge you even if you're watching tentacle porn. Now, I know that you can't do that with family but, a friend isn't really a friend if they can't accept your weird parts ya know? Sometimes I watch really funny ecchi anime with a friend of mine and we have a blast. Anyway, to answer your question no not really. I've been watching anime since I was 6 or so and I've never had a family member other than my aunt say that it's a little odd (And it was Chobits and she was concerned about it being sexist rather than sexual ) maybe I'm just lucky enough to have an open minded family. Of course I'd never watch something sexually graphic in from of them, that's just rude. But, I've watched things like HOTD and Elfen Lied around my Mom or Dad. They don't care. It doesn't hurt anyone. And the whole "You're too old for that" well, unless they're still paying for the roof over your head that's none of anyone's business. If your friends say that's weird, wrong, or disown you, you needed better ones anyway. Also OP you're much too young for anyone to be saying you're too old to watch anything. I know 30 - 40 year old people that are obsessed with Card Captors or other kid oriented shows. Just to note I'm not one of those weirdos that flip out about anime. I just don't hide the fact that I like it.
