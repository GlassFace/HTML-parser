 Chapter 723
 Ok so we learn a bit more about Doflamingo. He apparently "used to be" a Celestial Dragon but isnt anymore. We'll probably learn more about that in the weeks to come. But the main thing I'm excited about is a Sanji vs Doflamingo fight. That is going to be awesome!

That is going to be awesome! i doubt it will be sanji vs doflamingo it will end up being sanji and law or sanji and crew etc because dof would fodderize sanji i mean vergo snaped his leg with little effort and dof would crush vergo and i know people hat a,b,c theory but seriously sanji would get wrecked by dof 1 on 1

I really didn't expect law to escape there I thought he was done for. Fujitora is a badass with his gravity devil fruit.

I really didn't expect law to escape there I thought he was done for. Fujitora is a badass with his gravity devil fruit. i knew law would get away but I did not expect it being like he did. I thought someone would show up like robin and ap dof on the shoulder etc and with dof distracted i thought law would make his room and transport them all to the underground dwarve area and dof would not know where they are and head back to the fort. I'm much hapier with how it turned out tho i think law and sanji will and crew will all fight dof and fuji wont do a damn thing. Then they will all lose but leave dof hurt and beaten enough for it to be acceptable for luffy to come finish him off .I would be disappointed if luffy beat him by himself with dof at 100 percent because it would make dof look weak.

I think your underestimating the power of luffy. this is the guy who took down ennies lobby, luffy being on the same level as doflamingo at this point wouldnt surprise me at all. If sanji and law were able to take down doflamingo, that would be epic. would show the true power of the straw hat crew and maybe their crew would become one of the yonkou? that would be pretty dope.

No I think it is you who over estimates luffy and under eastimates doflamingo because dof is the king of the underworld ans has been operating as such for years in the new world with all the power house animals who would love to take his place at the top and you would not be surprised if luffy just walked in stepped 2 feet in the new world and layed him out by himself is luffy seriously powerful now for sure he is but with just stepping into the new world and taking out the king of the underworld as his first action with no help just smacking out dof i doubt it but if that is truly what you think then it is up to you but personally id like to see a bit more progression out of luffy before he just becomes a yonko for no reason but i truly find it a shock that a fan of one piece would be ok with luffy just walking simply into a yonkou position as simple as training for 2 years before entry and again i say i doubt oda would take such an epic story and just ruin it like that luffy will eventually be a yonkou for sure but not like that od will make luffy fight other crews and subs of the yonko and work his way up to show how powerful the yonko really are b4 luffy takes the head of one of the four and takes their place

I think luffy is very capable of taking on doflamingo. maybe its a bit over ambitious to say he will become yonkou at the end of this arc but I'm just thinking out loud. but i dont think i am underestimating his power at all. the fish man arc didnt show his full power and neither did the punk hazard arc. the straw hats are one of the strongest crews in the new world and they will prove it after taking down another shichibukai

No way they are just breaking the surface of the new world a place of crazy strong and fierce pirates vice admiral and admirals and bounty hunters and more and you think they are just automatically stronger then almost everyone there. and if that is true then where do they have to rise to over the next ten years of manga? because its def not gonna be like ok straw hats trained for 2 years now there yonko level now boring ten years of pointless manga while the straw hats run house on the whole new world effortlessly then the final war then over. im not trying to come off like an ass or like iw rite one piece or im right your wrong type of person its just i see no way for the straw hats to be as strong as you portray them as. Personally I think they are among the average new world strenght with plenty of people both pirates and marines above their level that they will have to rise to and become stronger.

First off, I have no idea how long the manga is supposed to last (is it being around for another 10 years a thing)? but this manga still has a lot to cover. now are the one piece pirates one of the strongest in the world? possibly. think about it, they are probably the strongest of the 11 supernova pirates which after 2 years probably have a decent foothold in the new world. luffy has an ally with a shichibukai in law and an ally with one of the yonkou (shanks). law talked about taking down a yonkou wth luffy in earlier chapters so that isnt out of the question. also, if they become yonkou within the next 2 years, this manga, in my opinion, still would have many more mysteries and issues to resolve.
