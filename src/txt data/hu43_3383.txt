 Hey there everyone! I'm an aspiring manga artist. I've been drawing for about 4 years now, and I'd love to get feedback and advice so I can keep improving! A lot of my art is fanart right now, but I plan on drawing more original stuff soon! I'm going to start with some of my older art... My Eyes of Naruto series from 2013 (all colored in GIMP with a computer mouse): Minato Namikaze from Naruto, from 2013 (all traditional media): A human version of Pinkie Pie from My Little Pony, a birthday gift from 2013 to my best friend! Colored in FireAlpaca with a computer mouse: "Draw this again" meme, a fanart of one of SophieChan's original artworks. Done in 2011, 2012, and 2013: Jingle from Animal Crossing, a Christmas drawing from 2013 done in FireAlpaca with a tablet. View a speedpaint of that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlMeT-pBlBg Now, some newer art! An iPhone background of Ene from Mekakucity Actors/Kagerou Project: Here's a speedpaint of this drawing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7TJ...ature=youtu.be Here's a link to another version, where Ene is smaller and looks better as an iPhone background: http://misschurro102.deviantart.com/...253A1400635016 Ayano Tateyama from Kagerou Project/Mekakucity Actors: Here's a speedpaint of this drawing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYBTep3UkMk Moria from Sophiechan90's "The Ocean of Secrets"! This was actually an entry in her contest, but I didn't win haha... Here's a speedpaint of this drawing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sprd-I_IFw0 Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist: Here's a speedpaint of this drawing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3cTjtoUzuA Here's a coloring tutorial I did with this drawing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11FGno1HyF0 And finally, this year's Christmas drawing, Baymax from Big Hero 6!: Speedpaint coming soon! Okay guys, that's it for now! I have more old drawings if anybody's interested, but I wanted to at least try to keep this post short haha... Constructive criticism on both the drawings themselves and the videos I've made are more than welcome! Thanks! ^-^
