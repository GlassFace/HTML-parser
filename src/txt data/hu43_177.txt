 Bluray & Anime
 I was at Best Buy yesterday, and I had a realization. Anime on Bluray is a rip off. Honestly, don't buy it. I've gotten a few anime on bluray, including one that was a gift, and they really don't look ANY better. I know that sounds hard to believe with anime having all these high tech CG and cutting edge animation now a days, but it's really true. You'll get like absolute perfect quality on anime DVDs now a days. I really don't see how bluray could possibly add to any show, and it's at least twice as expensive. Anime on Bluray is just starting to boom. I think in the last 6 months you've started to see actually 26 ep full series on bluray like Samurai Champloo and Full Metal Panic. Every time I goto BestBuy now a days there is at least 3 new animes on the shelf on Bluray. The only advantage I see with anime on bluray is stuffing a while series on one disc. That would be pretty cool, if they did it. But honestly, it's not worth the price. Something about anime allows awesome quality on DVD. I have Samurai Champloo on DVD, and the first time I put it in, a part of me thought they accidentally put a Bluray in my case. It was that awesome looking. So ya, just stick with DVD if you're an anime fan. Ignore the whole Bluray phase when it comes to anime. Not worth it. Probably never will be. Anime is already expensive as it is on DVD.
