 1st Playthrough + No Walkthrough Do other players do this often?
 I just want to enjoy the game before I get into the technical stuff. Crisis Core was ruined for me (mostly) the instant I looked at a walkthrough. 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
 I usually try to get my feet wet first. I usually buy strategy guides for games like assassins creed when I want to get everything. Or if I want to explore the making of and background more fully. I must admit I do hit up youtube when puzzles drive me bonkers. I always try to go through it a few times before seeking out help. But I get more enjoyment out of getting through a section and finishing the game than I do buy spending countless hours getting through one frustrating or ill conceived puzzle/activity. Not sure if that's exactly what you were asking for. Edit - though I can't remember the last time I replayed an entire game sans multiplayer matches. But I would like to do that wiht the plus game for tales of xillia someday. But I want to start xillia 2 before I do that.

 I tend to attempt to go the whole game without a walkthrough and just immerse myself in the experience of finding things out for the first time and having to deduce things, but some games are okay to use a walkthrough for straight away. I find that Pokémon is okay using a walkthrough just for certain things, like how to solve a puzzle, or even just looking up how to find a certain Pokémon, but things that are a lot more involved, I like to keep myself in the dark. Although I'll admit, sometimes I've regretted not knowing about something in advance. I'll never forget my disappointment during my first playthrough of Dragon Age II when I had no idea just how powerful the Arishok would be and didn't build my team effectively enough to defeat him. I'd literally built a team that was useless against him, and although he's not even the end boss, you kinda need to focus your development on defeating him... wish I'd have known that the FIRST TIME before I had to scrap my entire playthrough and start again! 0_o 
 A real gamer doesn't need a damn walkthrough, he's his own walkthrough. 
A calm . mind is the key to success.
 Yes, I do my first play without any outside help.

 I only look up missable things that you would almost certainly miss if you did not take time to explore everything like ever half hour. Game developers these days like to hide things everywhere. I like to handle everything else myself, such as dungeons and strategies.

Game developers these days like to hide things everywhere. I like to handle everything else myself, such as dungeons and strategies. Did you hunt for the joker teeth in arkham city? If you played it that is. I used the strategy guide for that. That turned into an obsession of mine in that game. Just like those damn feathers in assassins creed 2. Practically meaningless but just had to get those. But I think you got some equipment for getting the feathers in ac2 at least. Can't remember what the reward was for the teeth in arkham, was it just the trophy?

 Unless it's puzzle games, I try to play though it on my own. And even then, I wait till I'm gonna flip s*it before I go to a walk through. Then with Touhou which is hard as hell to even get past the first maybe 2 levels, on easy, then I look up walk thoughts and watch how better people than I play the game.

 I'll get some help from walkthroughs if I'm stuck (yes, sadly, sometimes), wanting to blitz the game and get over with it, or when I want a perfect game in one shot. Try avoid bad walkthrough writers (to minimalise spoilers etc). U will get used to some famous names once you are used to the circle/website and their genre

 Back in the day we used to call it "playing the game." 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 When Im playing games for the first time, I play through without looking at anything. Unless I get stuck somewhere and can figure out where to go then I might peek a faq just to see how to get past that part. Usually I don't use a guide or anything unless Im going for 100% completion. I usually don't do those unless its my 2nd or 3rd playthrough.

 Never usually use a walkthrough on first run, tend to do blind runs however I do now and then check the trophies just in case I don't miss anything too major

I definitely don't look at anything while I am doing a first play through, but if I decide I want to try to 100% or platinum a game I might look at some hints after that on how to go about it and what I need to do. I suppose I grew up not having access to these things, so I have a decent amount of patience when it comes to trying to solve a difficult puzzle or defeat a difficult boss, because I always had to or basically not finish a game. 

 @hell girl _ strategy guides have been around since the nes, before the internet as we know it today. Now are you referring to less popular games that dont have enough of a fan base to have a guide?

Now are you referring to less popular games that dont have enough of a fan base to have a guide? No, I'm talking about the fact that I was a kid and didn't have the money to buy them lol I'd have preferred another game to the book that told me how to play the one I already have. I'm talking about the fact that you couldn't just hop online at any time and check out a walkthrough. I've never really understood the strategy guide thing myself. The fun to me has always been overcoming the challenges. I'm not much of a rage quitter, and find persevering with something I find difficult to be the fun part of gaming. Having a book to tell me exactly what to do almost seems like watching someone else play it, if that makes sense? 

 @hell girl - ah understood. I use them when I want to complete everything. And as I mentioned I do like the background info/art and stuff.

 I want to play a game without a walkthrough, but then when games start adding cool secrets and one time only events that need certain actions to be triggered, or certain items that can only be obtained at a certain point, I end up having to look things up just so I don't miss them.

 I put like 3000+ hours into skyrim on my first playthrough. Who needs a walkthrough on a game thats as open as this? Everything points you to the right way in this game as well. Its not hard at all. Walkthroughs just strip away the mystery of games, makes it feel like you completed that game ONLY because you had assistance from somebody else. Dont you want to feel the glory of single handedly. If you cant beat a game alone, then how are you a gamer? You're more like a backseated gamer. Having help the whole way. 

 @sam - who ever said we use a game guide for the whole game?
