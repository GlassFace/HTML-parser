 Chinese city plans to fine unmarried mothers.
 http://news.yahoo.com/chinese-city-p...133939519.html BEIJING (AP) -- A Chinese city's plan to fine mothers who have a child out of wedlock has sparked criticism that the policy is discriminatory and could lead to an increase in abandoned babies. One expert said Monday that it was the first time that out-of-wedlock children had been expressly singled out for penalty by one of China's municipalities, which have flexibility in how they enforce China's population-control policies. It also came just days after the rescue of a young unmarried mother's newborn from a sewer pipe in eastern China prompted discussion over the stigma that single mothers face. "If the policy is approved, there could be more 'sewer babies,' because when mothers can't afford the cost, they might think about throwing their babies away," said Chen Yaya, a gender equality researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. On Friday, the government of Wuhan city in central Hubei published online a draft updated family planning policy which it says is aimed at keeping the city's birth rate at a low level. The policy says that "the parties" should pay the fee in cases of births that are out of wedlock or when one side knowingly has a child with someone who has a spouse. It has been interpreted in state media as mainly targeting unmarried mothers and women who have affairs with married men. The public has a week to comment on it. "It looks like the policy is targeted just at women from my understanding," Chen said. She said unmarried mothers already faced discrimination, including being barred from receiving maternity benefits from the government. Unmarried mothers also face stigma because premarital sex traditionally has been frowned upon. In the case of the baby found in the sewer in Zhejiang province on May 25, his mother told police she got pregnant after a brief affair, couldn't afford an abortion, hid her pregnancy from family and neighbors and had concerns about whether she would be able to raise the child. Police also said she told them the baby slipped into the sewer accidentally shortly after its birth  an account they later said they accepted. Not a whole lot to say, really. I mean, this is China. It's both unsettling, but not really surprising. I'm a little more surprised that the policy doesn't go further. Ha, the addition of fining women who have affairs with married men? Kind of @ss backward. "Why not fine them both?" "Fine both men and women then!" But many of us already know the answer. It starts with an "S" and ends with an "E." Premarital sex is frowned upon, but many schools there avoid the topic altogether. Understandably, in the States it's taught in many forms, but some people still make the choice in absent minded stupidity. But here, it's kind of a short path to no info, you're screwed kind of logistics. Never been to Mainland China; but very familiar with their... "policies" involving gender infiltration. Not surprising, but it's still a story. Thoughts on all of this?

 Didn't read it, but kinda don't have to. I believe people don't have to be married in order to have kids. THE PROBLEM IS: Single mothers (for any reason other than the husband dying and not by his own fault) Unmarried couples with kids, I have no problem with, and I was raised catholic. If unmarried single mothers are getting fined, what about fathers?

 Wow, just wow. Okay, so they want to control their population and it's understandable considering the state of their country, but fining unmarried mothers? Is it not enough to not allow them benefits? Their lives have got to be difficult enough facing discrimination and hardship. Why do they need to punish the baby any further by making it more difficult for the woman to take care of it? What made me laugh was the idea of fining women who have affairs with married men. It takes two to tango. If they are going to fine the woman, then they need to fine the men as well. But then again, it is China. Can't expect much.

 A common practice in China amongst mothers who have unwanted pregnancies, is to have the baby, and then they'll often leave them in a grocery store and get the hell out of dodge. When I say common, I mean daily/weekly.

 It kind of reminds me of the whole Obama care stuff but this is worse. You know things start off small. Too much government is not good. I was in Hong Kong not that long ago and it was cool.

 Yeah. I would write out A pretty angry response, but yeah, it's ****ing China.

 So they are fining these women even knowing all of the dead babies to come of it? This is why I'm terrified of ever visiting China. They're just so backwards.

Agreed, China isn't exactly known for it's ethical, non-sexist (not to mention sane) Solutions to it's problems. What's next? putting cyproterone acetate in all the drinking water and just chemically castrate entire populations?

And not to be harsh to he citizens of the mainland, but with a population that exceeds well over a billion and high poverty rates, you do have families living in and around dumpsters and alongside roads too. The grocery store just seems less suspicious for them I suppose? No one's really paying attention I guess. Oh China. I love your lead and asbestos policies, but hate your humanitarian record.

 I knew China was going to do something stupid soon, but I didn't expect this kind of stupidity.

 Speaking as a student of Chinese history and culture, this goes pretty much along the same lines as other policies since the 1200s. Repressing the feminine has been around for a long time. It is still very common for people to leave their girl children to die of exposure in the more rural areas. When the values system of an entire country dictates that women are disposable, policies like this will continue to surface. Although we can't really say much. Most Americans think women are disposable too.

 I'm not really surprised, after hearing about the forced abortions and all that jazz. But it doesn't seem like it will make their problems much better. And what about the mothers who were raped?

 While I am working from memory and easily mistaken due to possibly faulty remembrance of the matter but the forced abortions is probably the most humanitarian thing China has done. What I recall of the forced abortions is nothing to do with discrimination and everything to do with population control something they actually do need.

What I recall of the forced abortions is nothing to do with discrimination and everything to do with population control something they actually do need. It has something to do with the One-Child Policy or "Family Planning". This policy actually has negative affects considering this results in female infanticide, forced abortions, and some parents even fear to report that they gave birth to female children. I suppose this also has something to do with China's gender imbalance. I've actually seen some pics of doctors pulling fully grown infants out of their mother's womb after the infants were aborted through A chemical solution I believe.

 China is backing the traditional family structure. This has less to do with forced abortions and more to do with repressing women's (and men's) autonomy in regards to maintaining a single lifestyle or deviating from the custom of marrying by 30's. Forced abortions are local government policy and social pressure, as the One-Child Policy doesn't necessarily forbid having multiple children; couples are fined for additional children if they live in urban areas based on their income. Exceptions to this include twin births, ethnic minorities, couples who were only-childs, and rural couples. The state autonomous regions of Macau and Hong Kong are also exempt from the One-Child Policy. The policy was only enforced after 1979, and is noted to last only for one generation. Infanticide and forced abortion are sensationalized to reflect Western culture's ethnocentrism on the issue. Not saying that it doesn't exist but yeah it hasn't stopped the population growth rate in China.

 I understand why they're doing this but the penalties are ridiculous. It only punishes the female. Yet I expect this from China because it's another way to discriminate against females. I wonder if people will move as a result, either out of the city or out of the nation.
