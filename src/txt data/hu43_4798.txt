[Anime] Anime that makes you think
 So the last few anime shows I've watched have been pretty firmly entrenched in the mindless entertainment category. There isn't anything wrong with that, if I want something more mentally challenging I'll read a book or play music with my band, but I've gotten into the mood for a thought provoking anime. Thus I'm calling on you for help, A4 members. Tell me of anime that makes you use the grey matter while watching, stuff that shows instead of telling, ones where you have to pay attention or you will be lost as hell. Garden of Sinners is probably the best example I can come up with from anime I've watched recently, but really any genre of stuff as long as it's good.
