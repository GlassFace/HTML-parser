 SAO Controversy, why?
 So, it is hard to see an anime conversation online without somebody slamming SAO, it seems to take TONS of hate. What I would like to discuss is, is it really that bad? I mean, sure, I did think that it was a bit weak in some parts, (Sorry Yoda ,) but, it didn't deserve at all the hate it gets. I think people are getting way to worked up about an anime that wasn't that bad.

 Forget about the ALO arc and it's perfectly fine. A lot of people are incapable of this, though, making it a pretty polarizing series.

I'll say this once: Tell me you didn't get emotional when asuna and kirito finally met in the real world! I swear I cry Evey time I watch that part in alo. His quest for her is what makes alo worth it. OK that's all I'm gonna say. I'll try to stay out of this. I had to point that out. Got to go to sleep now.....

 Literally no part of the ALO arc is worth watching. Not even once. The lucky ones are those that were told not to watch it, didn't, and have kept their opiniond of SAO unsullied by the second arc.

 An anime's amount of hate is directly proportionate to its popularity, and when there are more people, the noise that they make is more noticeable. That is all it really is.

 Who... some parts? Just a wild guess, you got into anime with DBZ(a horrendously bad anime at that), so you are henceforth easily amused? Look the only thing good about the series, it the "boss" fights, and what, there were like 2(no the crystal dragon doesn't count as a boss fight) lol. There's no char/relationship development to speak of, after what the 7th ep, there's no story progression of any kind(after the time skip, um... they basically just stay put, and never progress anymore), the it that dares to call him self a writer, decided to write nothing but a premise, with random fluff, and call it a story in hopes some idiot publisher would be suckered into picking it up. It's the biggest abomination in the history of the written word. You can't have a romance without history/development, and build up, yet the POS series, focuses a large part on a romance that is rendered meaningless, due to the lack of the before mentioned elements.

 There's no controversy. It's a show. Some people like it. Some don't. And everyone expresses it in a different way. Tis the case with tons of popular things in all types of media.

 Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but my own feeling is that it attracts so much hate because it has (had?) such a large and vocal fanbase, many of whom treat what others regard as a very average show as the greatest thing since sliced bread. I don't think it's unique in that regard; hang around any fandom for long enough and you'll see it happen time and again.

 I've noticed that lots of people consider an anime (or books, film etc...) a masterpiece or a sleaze. There are no half-size only taking it to the extreme. Another facts is that the story began as a shonen and people aspected to see an action anime, instead SAO is a mix between action and feelings.
