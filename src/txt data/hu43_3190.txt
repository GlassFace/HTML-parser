[Slice of Life] Koufuku Graffiti
 Joining anime like Is the Order a Rabbit?, Kinmoza, and Sakura Trick, the latest series from the Manga Time Kirara family of magazines to get a TV anime is Makoto Kawai's cute girl cooking series Koufuku Graffiti. Kōfuku Graffiti (幸腹グラフィティ, officially translated as Happy Cooking Graffiti) is a Japanese four-panel comic strip manga written and illustrated by Makoto Kawai. It began serialization in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Miracle! magazine with the March 2012 issue. An anime television series adaptation by Shaft will begin airing in January 2015.

 Shaft?! This seems cute, but will it be worth it? 
 It's probably be a 3 minute run anime.

 I have high hopes on this piece. We'll see again the team of Shinbou and Shaft, plus Okada as series composition. In addition, the original manga comes from Houbunsya which brings some successful slice-of-life (nichijyou-kei) pieces. This seems to guarantee original's quality. So I want to hope that this adaptation will be a place of happy meeting between good manga and skillful anime staff. On the other hand, this adaptation would be a challenge for staff if scenes of cooking and dining are important to drive its story forward. It must be tough for staff to draw those scenes, requiring time and true skills. I'm looking forward to seeing how they deal with it. Please don't show us too much cuts of something like picture-cards. 
 These girls are so moe, once you realize how much they were manufactured to look and sound so moe, it actually becomes a bit...odd. The high quality definition on the food and the very casual progress/introduction in this pilot episode was pretty notable overall. So much borderline Yuri with this first episode. OH my goodness that was such a placid episode to me. I'll stay tuned though, the female cast looks just as eye-catching as something like Sabagebu! Another good cooking series to keep an eye out for is Shokugeki no Soma. I've been purposefully holding off on reading the manga because I want to see the anime if it ever does come out this year. From what I can tell, the battle drama is well crafted and plenty of ecchii service is thrown in with a tasteful manner. Ha, get it? Tasteful? MUHAHAHA

 The SHAFT animation style is really interesting and good-looking at times, funny too. I can certainly see the moe with Kirin and Ryo's close relationship and the attention to detail in those eating scenes. Still, I ask myself how am I going to stay hooked to this story of two really well done females in terms of personality and body language...and cooking, and moe voices.

 I was wondering if this got a thread and so it did, guess I didn't search hard enough. So first episode is great, and i'm about to watch the second. It's not really ecchi, more implied ecchi, I have yet to see panties so it's what would be called clean besides the erotic eating but even they don't seem to bad. Just close ups of lips and what not...and sounds XD. Second episode is great too, but they can't make some of our American foods look good like they do in anime with Japanese foods. Don't know why I'm thinking about that but yah, I doubt they can make Jack's Pizza or something look good. Them Japanese want perfection with everything. I love the OP

 Thank god this is not 3 minutes...the animation for this anime is beautiful. Story is really not there but I'm sure it will fill in. AND if they make a pizza scene they could use a reference from Silver Spoon, and with their animation they can make it more beautiful then the Silver Spoon scene. 

 Every time they eat . . . looks erotic. I can see SHAFT traces like the head tilts.

 That intro, already things remind me of Arakawa Under the Bridge...I miss that anime, and the manga scanlations are sort of dry. The girls are just repeating lines on a script that explains flavor and texture that the audience can't even taste or smell, with whimsical background music and awkward detail in the close-ups. So much EGG in this episode. The girls can be so cute sometimes! Even though they're engineered to be like that.

 Kirin, family is important but a three-star Chinese restaurant? Really? Shiina can get so sick so quick, poor her. Some bit of Grandma's history was shed, that's cool. I hate my Grandmother though. The tears of the Cashier were pretty funny. It was only a matter of time before our MC got gooey cream in her mouth with all the erotic, detailed scenes in this anime. Honestly, the seiyuu must have had a hard time keeping her laughter under control as she said that line about the cream filling her entire mouth, knowing that the anime was going to have an erotic undertone. How come the OJ didn't get any love?! Orange juice is BAWS. Oh she just used the "daisuki" so confirmed lesbians...I'm just kidding, those two girls are really close friends. No plastic bags to hold those veggies, so unsanitary. Silly girl yelling at strangers. Such a smooth episode...I think the only worthwhile thing here was the appearance of the HAWT Librarian. Slurp, Gulp is the title of the next episode, huh? The writers are having too much fun knowing that the animation team is going to go H.A.M. with the eating scenes. Next time: cunnilingus.

 Gotta be honest. Episode got me a little teary eyed. The flashbacks of Grandma and the hard work she put in to take care of her granddaughter. Got me a little chocked up. 

 The OP is great!! So cute! Maybe I'll watch it when I have free time.
