 Hai :3
 Hello to all the read and reply! I'm not good at introductions, but I'll try. My name is Soma and I am a neko. I think I am pretty friendly and easy to get along with but I am very shy and hardly say much of anything. I tend to be a little more open once I have gotten to know someone better. Oh, and my favorite color is purple if anyone cares haha. Uh... I don't know what else I can say about myself but I can post this: http://myanimelist.net/profile/SomaTheNeko There is a lot more stuff about me there and you can check out my anime stuff. Happy Valentine day to anyway celebrating that and I hope I can make some friends here. :]
