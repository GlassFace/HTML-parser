[Fantasy] Sengoku Musou (Samurai Warriors)
 Toyotomi Hideyoshi is on the verge of unifying the realm, and all that remains is the Odawara Castle protected by the "Lion of Sagami" Ujiyasu Houjou. Hideyoshi's personally trained generals—Ishida Mitsunari, Katou Kiyomasa, and Fukushima Masanori—as well as Ootani Yoshitsugu, Shima Sakon, and Naoe Kanetsugu are all on the frontline of the battle. Amidst the battle formation are the two young warriors of the Sanada household: older brother Nobuyuki and younger brother Yukimura. As the stalemate begins to break down, Sanada Yukimura rides on a lone horse into the fray. His brother follows him right after. This appears to be an anime adaptation of the Playstation historical hack-n-slash console game. Which.... I was a fairly hardcore player of. It's like Dynasty Warriors except with historic Japanese characters, but it's better than Dynasty Warriors because it has a lot more RPG elements including full storylines and progressive character building. But since the storyline is historical anyways, I guess you could also say it's just an adaptation of historic tales . xD

 I remember playing the newest one with all my friends back in late 2014, making characters who looked like us. Fun times. 
 So a Sengoku Basara spin?
