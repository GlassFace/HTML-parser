 Paper or Digital?
 Digital books are awesome. The ebook readers right now are super easy on the eyes as well. I tend to read a lot of 700-1000 page books, so when you're reading that much content, it's just so much easier to read in bed with an ebook reader. They're also cheaper, can be retrieved instantly, and there's no risk of losing them because they're on your account so even if your reader is destroyed you can access them again easily. Yeah, I don't think I could ever go back to using paper books as a standard.
