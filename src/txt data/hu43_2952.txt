[Action] World Trigger
 In Mikado City (三門市) (280 000 inhabitants), a "gate" to a different world is opened suddenly one day. Monsters called "Neighbors" (近界民（ネイバー）) start appearing from it, everyone is afraid of them because Earth's weapons don't work against them, but a mysterious group starts fighting off the Neighbors. They, the "Border" defense agency, create a defense system against the Neighbors. Since then, regardless of the Neighbors still emerging from the gates, people of Mikado City were living normally today. Four and a half years after the gate is opened for the first time, Yūma Kuga (空閑 遊真), a humanoid Neighbor, comes to Mikado City, where he meets Osamu Mikumo (三雲 修), a Border agent.
