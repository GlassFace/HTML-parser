[Action] Akame ga KILL! - Page 2
 Second episode was great...not as epic as the first, but I like the way they setting the MC up being trained and all... Thought Tutsumi would shed a few tears and be sick about what happened, sure as hell i'm glad he reacted the way he did Yeah characters like Mine we get alot of, but something tells me she's different then the others...Akama and the semi gay guy be cracking me up, had to lol a few moments... This is some good stuff man 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 Yeah, Minister Santa truly is quite the ****er...he's not the only one though, which is the worst part. I'm enjoying the picture stills and motion picture images, they're nicely drawn. Now let us watch as love begins to blossom. That next enemy...things are going to start being laid down for the rest of the plot. 
 great ep once again...Mine is pretty funny and Tatsumi's unorthadox way of getting things done is majestic as f. Next bad guy looks awesome, hoping for the best 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 Nowo we have a couple of main bad people showing their faces, looking forward to it. 

 Sheele special episode next week!!! 

 Damn I need to get to the anime soon, I'm a huge fan of the manga but I've been waiting for a few more eps to come out so I can watch them all at once. Judging from people's reactions, it seems like a great anime so far. But the feels later on though.... Don't click this spoiler unless you've read the manga.  Spoiler What I love about it is that the main characters don't really have invulnerability (except tatsumi and akame) and anyone of them could die...and even some enemy deaths are sad, like bors' death. 

 Dem Imperial Arms... dat moment... dat clutz... Way to make a guy feel welcome... And that beheading!  Spoiler You have my sword... Oh, and here's an older one I dug up... This is sweet revenge.

 This anime gets better every week. I loved that Sheele special...also Hana Kana in the show now and she looks like she's going to go crazy next week. Considering Tatsumi is the one who killed her teacher. 

 Oh yes, so much Sheele! <3 But what about Esdeath and Seryuu? <3 These guys were so serious... Well, not always... And Tatsumi does make some fine faces sometimes!

 Idk why this anime is not talked about more, its amazing. We're about to have one hell of a battle 

 Damn rights we are! I'm not sure why this thread is so empty either. I'm talking about Akame ga Kill all the time elsewhere. If you want lots and lots of Akame ga Kill screencaps, I've been posting them on my tumblr blog but haven't had time to post 'em here... http://ned-san.tumblr.com To give you an idea of how popular my Akame ga Kill posts are on Tumblr, this one on Esdese has 570 notes: http://ned-san.tumblr.com/post/96926...es-about-silly and this one on Chelsea has 333: http://ned-san.tumblr.com/post/98148...-of-night-raid That's a lot for me, when my posts don't usually garner more than about 30-50 notes in general.

 Akame's sister seems like she is way more powerful than akame right now. Hopefully akame will show a power we haven't seen yet. But the part I'm looking forward to the most is seeing the boss fight
