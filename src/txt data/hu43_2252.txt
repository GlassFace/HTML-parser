[Personal Life Discussions] Are you shy? - Page 2
 I would say I am to an extent. I'm not the outgoing type but I don't shy away from conversations. Though I don't normally strike up a conversation with a total stranger that often. Also I wouldn't say I'm agoraphobic but I prefer one on one conversations over group conversations. I guess I feel like I'm butting in when it's a large group. Or I might not feel like I have enough to contribute to the topic. I wouldn't say I'm a push over but I'm not the strong a type personality either. Maybe it has something to do with growing up with an older sister when I was a kid.... (she definitely has the a type personality)
