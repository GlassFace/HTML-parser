 Hi, I just joined, and figured I'd get the intro outta the way. I found this forum doing research about "The Mysterious Cities of Gold," which I have been watching again lately. I have been a fan of anime since the early-mid 80's, but only recently put 2 and 2 together, when I tracked down titles from my childhood like "Mapletown," "Battle Commander Daimos(Starbirds)", and of course, "The Mysterious Cities of Gold." I grew up with the likes of Pok√©mon thru high school, so I had forgotten that anime could have such depth. Are there anymore titles similar to the ones I mentioned that ya'll might recommend? I'm trying to broaden my palette, so to speak
