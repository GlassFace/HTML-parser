 Action scary-ish anime recommendation
 I've been looking into watching something more action-like, not necessarily adventure, but with a lot of fight scenes or something along those lines. Does anyone have a recommendation for an anime that's filled with action, but still has a decent story and is also a little scary? Only a little scary please, I'm only so brave... 
 The rivals just got a lot sexier.
