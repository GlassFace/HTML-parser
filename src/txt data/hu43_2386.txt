[Anime] Best Anime Quotes: Profound, Inspirational, Insightful
 I recently went back and watched all of Cowboy Bebop and remembered that it has some amazing lines in it that were pretty profound and insightful. I also have been pretty close to finishing Bakuman & Gundam Build Fighters, and did finish watching Kill La Kill. All three of those had some pretty inspirational lines and even their intros are motivating. So I was wondering if any of you have some favorite quotes/line from an anime series or movie that you feel was either profound/insightful or modivational? Please if possible post the quote, series/film, and episode if it's a series. If the line is said more than once in the series, don't worry about what episode (though it still would be nice to know). Thank you and I look forward to see what everyone posts. Additionally, any deep thought question about life and existence would be great too in terms of quotes. I remember that Outlaw Star had a few here and there.
