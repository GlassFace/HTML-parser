[Anime] Need a new Anime! :D
 Well, At the moment i'm watching: Fairy Tail, Barakamon, Claymore and Tokyo Ghoul, as well as trying to finish Kyoukai no Kanata. I'll try and finish all of those, all though once i've finished most of those, i'll start watching Spice and Wolf as well as No Game No Life. Thanks for the suggestions guys! KEEP THEM COMING!
