 Need help with calories burned (Biking)
 Hard for any application to be 100% accurate. I have used MyFitnessAPP for a while, and added every meal and activity into it. In my personal opinion it is the best choice. Due to it having almost every meal from every country, many good exercise options for the best calculation of calories. It helped me lose 3KG in just a few weeks. Which is more than I'd ever manage by myself.
