[OOC] Memento Mori: The Circle
 hehe, sorry that i've been a bit M.I.A but once school's calmed down i'll be ok! In the mean time i'll try and post whenever i can, but i'll probably be catching up on Anime (Blood C, Clannad and maybe Air...So depressing xD) So yeah, glad this RP is still going on despite the small amount of people
