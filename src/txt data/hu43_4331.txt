 Japan outraged at ISIS Beheading of Hostage.

Iran and Russia stepped in, and the US came down with a case of cold feet, leaving the rebels to a meat-grinder. Naturally they turned to the people with money, weapons, and manpower in the region. This bolstered the status of the extremists real quick as they could claim they were fighting to help their fellow muslims. Gradually it no longer became a choice, you either joined up with the Big-Baghdadi gang, or you were permanently on its shitlist. It was really only a matter of time before the forces were radicalized without outside intervention, now it's rare but there are still a few secular forces fighting both ISIS and Assad's regime. Pretty much that. Also, ISIS are pretty useful for furthering geo political and domestic aims of....well pretty much every relevant nation on Earth. They ain't going anywhere for a while and its not because 'herp derp we can't kill all of them.' Killing people has never been a problem for a modern army. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro?
