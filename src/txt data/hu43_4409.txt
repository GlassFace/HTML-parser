 Looking for jazzy tracks
 Ive been recently listening to a lot of jazz, but my pandora play list wont go any further than all of the well know singers such as Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, etc etc. Im looking for some new jazz to listen to. It can be smooth jazz, acid jazz, swing, anything of the jazzy nature. preferably something like the track below [which happens to be acid jazz, according to google]  Spoiler i would really appreciate the help, cheers
