[General Discussion] What do you do during holiday breaks?
 I just laze around, surfing the web, obtaining new music and organizing what music I have, working, video games, and watching TV. So, basically what most modern do when they have free time on their hands. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
