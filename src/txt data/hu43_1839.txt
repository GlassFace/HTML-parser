[Anime] Help to identify a doll
 Can anyone tell me the name of the doll/puppet of the image i have in my avatar? thx 
 Do you have a more blurry and out of focus pic you can put up? 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 It vaguely looks like Captain Falcon. Then again with how low-quality the image is, it could just as well be a turd dressed in a suit. 
 Looks like a aviansie... but doubt it is.

 it's the only pic i have, and i'm trying to found and buy the same doll, but it's really difficult! 
 Are you sure its from a Japanese animation/anime? There's something distinctly 80's western cartoon/puppet show about it. Like a villain from Darkwing Duck or something, lol. Maybe ask on those kind of boards?

 Looks familiar, maybe if you could post a bigger one? These avatars are just big enough to be avatars and nothing else.
