If I see a man (edit: Or woman) masturbating to children, real or not, they're a pedophile because they have a _sexual attraction_ to children of ages 0-12. Real or damn well not. Stop bring child abuse into this, it's NOT THE ****ING SUBJECT. Dammit you pedophiles are retarded as much as you're disgusting. Edit: Hey, f*ckwits who won't shut up about what a pedophile is: http://www.google.co.uk/search?clien...utf-8&oe=utf-8 Now, stop the "IF I DISTORT THE MEANING OF PEDOPHILE ENOUGH, I WON'T BE ONE" crap.
