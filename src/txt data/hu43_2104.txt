 A4 Idol 8: Let's Break some Wine Glasses! =] - Page 2
 What: A singing contest where contestants sing anything they want. Who: Anyone can make a submission, anyone at all! Where: On A4(here)! When: Submissions will be accepted immediately and until Midnight on; February 10th(Saturday) 2014, giving you around four weeks to find a song, sing it, upload it and post it here! How: There are numerous methods to record and share your submission. Here's one way: Download Audacity, free recording software, and install it on your computer.Hook up a microphone and record your song with Audacity.Export as a .mp3 file somewhere on your computer. Make sure you know where!Upload the .mp3 file to http://kiwi6.com/ - I'm not going to be accepting youtube entries this time, please upload your submission on kiwi6, thanks!Reply to this thread and post the kiwi6 link to your song along with original title and artist. ???? Profit! The Rules Freestyle! The song can be anything you want it to be, though you do get mad respect for singing in Japanese! You are actually allowed to sing a song with someone from A4 if you feel handy with your software!If you want to sync it up with a karaoke version of the song in editing software like Audacity that's fine, but it might be easier for the inexperienced to simply record it a cappella.You are allowed only one entry. Voting just going to have the people's choice award, where A4 users vote for the participant who entertained them the most, not necessarily who sings the best. If you aren't very good at singing or aren't confident about it, just remember to have fun. Pick a song that means something to you that you enjoy singing. It's for fun more than anything! - Might get in some Judges if we actually do get in some entries this time! - SO GET OUT YOUR MICROPHONE AND SIIIIIIIING!!! (I'll get my entry up ASAP =] ^_^)
