 Vegeta vs Hulk! - Page 3
 You all hurt my head. Vegeta is a boss. He'd kill Hulkey just by looking at him. 
 It was only a matter of time... Now I am one with the night and stars again... Thank you, Rhyme's Law, for your signature art work.

 Originally Posted by DUNN x DOLO The issue here is that everybody is going off of "theories."

Now regardless of the "potential" to destroy planets, are we saying that because they Dbz characters didn't want to destroy the planets they were fighting on, they held back their power? So Vegeta could have easily beat Frieza, Perfect Cell, Buu, etc etc, but he sat there and let himself get beat up for the planet's sake? Vegeta may have the ability to blow planets up with layzoors and energy balls, but the manga, and anime proved that Vegeta royally sucks when it comes to hand to hand combat with anybody other than Goku. Which is in fact the hulks specialty. Also, while Saiyans get stronger the closer to death they are, the power is not realized until the are fully restored after that point. Meaning Vegeta would have to get beat down, then the hulk just sits idly by and lets him take a Sensu bean or some other way to heal himself. Based off they actual story when has vegeta ever done that? Destroying the planet woud not have worked on Frieza and Buu because they can survive in space, and besides, he was mostly a good guy by the time Cell came up. In Frieza's arc, he wanted the Dragon Balls. But that aside, Vegeta is clearly a victim of what we call obvious plot induced stupidity. Why is it that Vegeta cannot fight well against anyone except for Goku when Goku is the one that usually ends up beating all the bad guys? There is really no reason other than to put Goku in the spotlight and emphasize their rivalry. DBZ is certainly not the most consistent series out there. I have to admit that it hurts his credibility. And I think Vegeta almost killed himself during the Frieza saga when he found out that Dende could heal, but Dende refused to heal him. Originally Posted by Struggler Why is this planet-destroying nonsense still going on? Let's entertain th idea that Vegeta can destroy a planet. He does it, and then what? He dies. Hulk survives as he has before. Hulk doesn't even have to do anything to kill Vegeta when the little squirt will do it all on his own. The planet destroying nonsense was just to affirm that Vegeta has power, not to say that he would claim an instant win from blowing up the planet. Whether he would do that is a fight is a toss up. The attempt to quantify his power is to bring up the question, how much power can the Hulk normally tank without plot shields up?

 The fact remains that the Hulk has destroyed at least one planet I know of (and that was just from an indirect clash with someone else), and has many times over survived blows capable of destroying planets, among many other ridiculous things. Vegeta got choked out by a hairless space tranny and failed to kill an evil blob of bubble gum with the most powerful attack he's ever used in his most powerful form.

 Was not that planet arguably extremely volatile to being with? Does not count it if was close to blowing itself up soon.

 Whatever you need to tell yourself. This isn't an argument. It's a growing list of strengths and accomplishments of one character versus the potential and hypothetical power of another. Vegeta would be no match for Grey Hulk, let alone Green Scar. May as well compare Roshi's turtle to Hulk for all the effect Vegeta would have on green man.

 And another thing. You may not know this but a moon is not a planet. So even if roshi destroyed one and vegeta is stronger than roshi it doesn't necessarily imply that vegeta could destroy a planet and to date he has not in canon while hulk has

 I think given their strengths (even if vegeta has shown to be very durable) I don't think his body can quite take on Hulk head on. I think any orgasms that might have been even in super sayan would be too much for him. Hulk would obliterate his butthole into oblivion. Which is why I think Hulk being the stronger one would be on the receiving end. Even in super sayan mode hulk would be able to take Vegeta's thrusts multiple times over without passing out. Which would make vegeta pass out from all the workout as he would fail to give Hulk an orgasm

Okay there are several different vegeta forms and hulk forms being thrown into this mix. Can we just have both of them at a certain point fight. Not all these different ones? Example: Vegeta before super saiyan Hulk after becoming the hulk

Not all these different ones? Example: Vegeta before super saiyan Hulk after becoming the hulk Their most powerful incarnations are the only things that need be compared. Green Scar Hulk and Majin Vegeta, or SSJ4 if you'd like to include GT, but it would likely just be detrimental to the Pro-Vegeta argument with GT's major inconsistencies and lack of supporting evidence for much of anything aside from said inconsistencies.

Ill go with Mahjin Vegeta for the win on this one then, for remember when cell was so strong his power up would shake the planet? Also vegetas final flash could deform if not destroy the planet? Plus the fact that piccolo when he was weaker 1,200 power destroyed the moon? Well if the hulk was strong enough to destroy a asteroid then vegeta was that strong in his normal form easily. So he could very easily dispose of the hulk in this form 

 Again with the theoreticals

 I honestly don't think it would be remotely close. Vegeta could have destroyed a planet by the very beginning of Dragon ball Z series with the power that he had. That's not even mentioning how powerful he becomes by the end of the series. And no I'm not counting GT. I could be wrong but I don't think Hulk ever possessed that kind of power. I don't know that much background on Hulk though. I've only seen the movies. Still, it's not even a fight in my mind.

As I posted before, Hulk's footsteps have done more damage than Vegeta ever has. Vegeta only ever claims he's capable of destroying Earth. If he couldn't destroy a planet by recklessly blowing himself up in his most powerful form, he absolutely wasn't capable of doing it early on when he was at his weakest.

 I think Vegeta's abilities deserves some clarification. He is supposedly able to destroy planets but is never shown to do anywhere near that much damage to the landscape or otherwise. It could be because they are holding back, because they are controlling their powers to keep it localized, or it could just be because of bad writing. It is all theory. However, it is not theory that Vegeta can in fact destroy planets because this fact has been explained and quantified in the canon material. It takes 300 Kili to destroy a planet. SSJ Goku has over 3000, but Goku and Vegeta were fighting in SSJ2 form toward the end, which is canonically stronger than the SSJ1 form. Since Vegeta won that fight, it is really unquestionable that he has more than the 300 Kili necessary to destroy planets. Anyone want to do calculations for how much energy it takes to blow up a planet? It is never explained in the anime or manga why he is never shown with that kind of output even though his power has been relatively quantified, but unless there is canonical reason explaining why he cannot do it, he does not have to show that he can do it thanks to the fact mentioned above. Claiming that he does not have that kind of power without any evidence to disqualify the established numbers is the actual theory here, and Vegeta not having been shown to destroy a planet is lack of evidence, not evidence against. It is no different from people feeling certain that you would melt if you go too close to the sun based on the temperature calculations alone even though no one has actually gone to the sun to put their hand on it and say, "oh look, my hand is melting." Now if people want to argue whether or not he is competent enough to use that kind of power against the Hulk, then go all out.

 Except the single use of the kili measurement did not determine anything outside of stating what Yakon and Goku's power levels were in that form of measurement. The only times a number is given to planet-destroying power requirements is in the anime (non-canon), and by a Daizenshuu (non-canon). Non-canon material doesn't determine the canon. This continues to be entirely beside the point. Were he capable (he's not), Vegeta could destroy all the planets he likes. The fact remains that it simply wouldn't matter. Hulk would survive. Vegeta could turn the entire planet to dust, and he'd only be killing himself. Debating whether or not Vegeta could destroy a planet based on evidence of his power is pointless, as Frieza did do it, and clearly he would be no match for Hulk.

 Anybody know the Vegeta vs Goku ssj2 fight powerlevels compared to ssj2 cell gohan? I think we can lightly relate cell to hulk because of regeneration right? So if ssj2 vegeta can output the kind of power than can kill cell, I think he would beat hulk. Where people say vegeta could not destroy planets, I seem to recall the final flash move he trained in the time chamber and then used against cell threatened to destroy the planet. Likewise with goku's IT kamehameha. They only didn't because they were directed away. I think we can assume that in the buu saga both goku and vegeta are more powerfull. Also, battle of the gods is canon, and when angered vegeta lays some hurt on the god of destruction. judging by the clip at the end before beerus sleeps, he can destroy things (planets) easier than anything in a comic book so if hulk punched bulma in the ovaries, vegeta would probably beat hulk senseless

This context being one where we use empirical evidence and data to decide if one cartoon could beat another cartoon.

 That one instance of kili measurement gave away a lot more information than you are giving it credit. It gave the relative measurement of energy required to destroy a planet in the form of kili in order to give an idea of Goku and Yakon's energy output. If it takes 1 Trillion J (exemplary number) to destroy a planet--even a small one--, that means Yakon has 2.7 Trillion J, and Goku has at least 10 Trillion J of energy in SSJ1 form. It determined that Goku can destroy planets because 1, he has more than enough energy to do so, and 2, it has already been determined that ki blasts (e.g. the kamehameha wave) can destroy celestial bodies; therefore, it no longer needs to be visually shown because all the evidence is there to show that he has both the power and means to do it, but if you want to argue that Vegeta defeated Goku because he was the better martial artist and not because he had more power (i.e. less than 300 kili), then that is a different story. So the point in bringing up Vegeta's power is not to say that he blows up the planet, Hulk survives it, and game over. This is to make the point that Vegeta has more than enough power to go toe-to-toe with the Hulk in his strongest incarnation. The Hulk is not going to automatically win just because Vegeta lacks the visual feats to support his actual power. He already has the math to back it up, which is more solid than anything he can "show." If anything, Hulk's more visual feats, such as his footsteps cracking the ground, are more ambiguous, and should be up for debate. In any case, how they would fight and their competence in that fight is a different matter. Vegeta tends to be cocky and over-confident, so he may lose out in the end due to that. That I find to be a more valid argument. How exactly is the Hulk's mentality in his latest incarnation? Is he brilliant like his Professor Hulk form, or more dull like his Savage Hulk form?

 The kamehameha has been used to blow up a gargantuan rock; the moon. Quite different from a planet. Again, the Hulk did the same with a single bare-fisted punch, except the asteroid he destroyed was 4 times the size of Earth.

 The moon is a 5th of the earth, i am pretty sure by the time anybody could go super saying, EVERYBODY was well over 5 times piccolo's power when he did the moon in. Plus i am sure there are quite a few references in the anime to how someone could blow up the planet. Also dont miss out the point I made about battle of gods. Beerus can destroy like 6 planets in a matter of seconds with no fatigue, and vegeta took a punch in the face from him and the hit back harder My point of comparing cell was that cell only survived as long as he did because of regeneration. Hulk does a similar thing, he can be injured he just regenerates. My point was the massive energy effects we see in dbz would do the same thing, tear him apart at the smallest level. If you did that there would be no irradiated organic matter to repair itself. So if you hit him with a big shot in one go, he is screwed.
