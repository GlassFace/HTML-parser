 One Piece: Pirate Warriors
 @ Ravz - I have to respectfully disagree. They still could have ended the way they did in the Anime/Manga. The positive note would be Luffy realizing that even though he lost a brother, he still has his nakama. They could have shown the part where Luffy gave the message to his nakama about 2 years instead of 3 days. The ending could/should have been at the scene where he places his hat on the rock to train for the next 2 years.
