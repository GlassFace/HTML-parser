[General Discussion] Do you shop on black Friday? (US super sale day)
 I used to shop regularly on Black Friday. I had been going out since I was ten years old and fighting crowds for material goods at cheap prices. But I did not go last year and am not sure if I will go this year. There has to be something amazing to draw me in and I have not found it yet. Maybe I will. Also, the sales that go on on Black Friday are also ongoing afterwards or even in the weeks prior. You just have to look. Same prices and sales, but no crowd fighting. Then again, fighting is part of the fun. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
