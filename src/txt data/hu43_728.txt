[Mecha] Suisei no Gargantia (Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet) - Page 2
 Err, sorry I meant to write that for valvrave the liberator xd. And yeah, this show owns along with attack on the titans. 
 Ah yeah, Valvrave is just completely off the rails and I'd recommend it as well. Just don't go into it expecting serious drama or anything. 

 So far so good! Some aspects of the story is kinda typical butch gen, but things have been mostly interesting. I just hope Production I.G. doesn't pull a Guilty Crown on me and **** everything up within a few episodes.

 I don't like the direction this show is heading...The first 2 episodes where great, the 2 after that easy going and pretty mediocre, number 5 and 6 where poorly animated imo...Only the ending of the last ep, which was also pretty dull, makes me wonder how the f it got there. But if this anime only gets a 13 ep batch, they have to pick up the pace from here on in. Otherwise I see a grimm future lol. 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 I like the slice of life stuff, it's showing us how the guy is growing use to the new world he's in. I'm loving the direction it's going and I am interested in seeing the direction it is going.

 This is a really interesting one! I hope they reveal more about Red's past soon; that small glimpse they gave us was curious stuff.

 ^ Who's Red? I've spent some time on the wiki and I see nothing about the person.

I agree a little on the slice of life stuff...I was looking forward to see how the main character adapts to the beautiful setting given to him. I just don't see how a little girl shaking her bum for 5 minutes is an asset to the show. Amy is a nice girl and all, but they could've spent the last episode diggin in to his past and/or showing a little of the life that he lived in his envirement etc. We're halfway and we still don't know jack about our hero... 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 seen three episodes! I'm liking it! 
 Dubstep Chaos Theory - ShockOne l Siren - Kat Krazy ft Elkka l Faith - BlasterJaxx 
 The last episode had the kind of spunk in it I was hoping for the last 4 eps or so. Lots of action and great dialogue's made this, apart from the first one, the second best part of the anime. Go Ledo! 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 Ledo is leaving the gargantia!?

 Well I certainly wasn't expecting the transhumanism angle. Not really sure how to feel about it, it's not a bad twist but it still wasn't really what I thought was going to happen. I mean I figured humans were behind the Hideauze, but the fact that they're simply a forced post-human evolutionary path and are in fact essentially the same as us was pretty crazy. Also makes the Galactic Alliance even less sympathetic since they're basically pushing a racial purity agenda. Granted, Chambers is at least slightly correct that those news feeds could contain some propaganda, but the basic truth is pretty obvious now. Be interesting to see where they go with this now. 

 Kind of a mind f*ck, not what you said Ian but at the end when they destroyed that Hideauze. Chamber usually listens but this time he didn't. That's what got me in this episode, but over all this was the best episode yet.

That's what got me in this episode, but over all this was the best episode yet. Yea I was also shocked that Chamber ignored his orders and killed the Hideauze. 

 I don't think he ignored his orders so much as acted before listening to orders. Chamber does act on his own most of the time. Sometimes you wonder what Ledo is even needed for. Ledo is not like a pilot, but more like a commanding officer to Chamber. 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 While Chambers does seem to act somewhat autonomously at times, he still doesn't appear to be a fully functioning AI. There's some sort of command directive issued that leads to his actions in basically any case I can think of, including the latest episode. Remember that early in the episode Ledo clearly stated they were going to exterminate every Hideauze despite Chambers worries over energy consumption. Though Chambers also seems to be able to take some unique actions based on the state of his pilot, but I assume it's pretty limited given his decisions so far; such not waking up Ledo for six months until they got hauled out of the ocean, or continuing with his previous order when Ledo was obviously emotionally and mentally distressed by the content of the latest episode. It could be that he's similiar to a "shackled" AI like EDI in Mass Effect 2, but I think he's most likely just a very advanced computer with a load of subroutines that are based in simple computer logic, given circumstances related to his location, the status of his pilot, and the status of the Hideauze. So yeah, like Ned said I think it's basically Ledo acting as his commanding officer, although he does seem to have a decent aptitude for combat himself given the way he manages to evade the Gargantia crew in episode 2. Also also, my main reason for thinking Chambers isn't a true AI is it's pretty obvious the Galactic Alliance is a bunch of space racists/supremacists/purists or whatever you want to call them. Given how badly they reacted to transhumanism, I can't imagine they'd be okay with true artificial intelligence either.

Wow you just changed my whole mindset on the matters of Chambers killing the Hideauze. 

 Chamber is programmed to kill hideauze and I don't understand why he didn't to ledo.

Yeah, Chamber is always monitoring Ledo's body functions like that. Like in the first episode when he was surprised Ledo's body didn't give much reaction to the mention of visiting Atlantis.

 Alright I had my qualms about this series after the initial fireworks died out. HOWEVER after the latest episode its grabbed my attention again. The build up was beginning to bore me but the revelation of the hideauze's origin is a tease for interesting things to unfold *twiddles fingers* I retract my dislike for the series 
 Wasn't expecting that reveal at the end! I guess Pinion is just a horrible jerk after all. 

 Yeah, very disappointed in Pinion. 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 Pinion is a major jerk >.> I don't like Chamber now either. The thing is starting to take on a life of it's own. XD.
