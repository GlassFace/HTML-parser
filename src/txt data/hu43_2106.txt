 I really enjoyed this show so far! Along with Wizard Barristers: Benmashi Cecil, these were two very pleasant, unexpected surprises for me this season! May the light of Zvezda shine upon you!

 "We will crush them with the full might of Zvezda!" Best. Transformation. Ever. But they're like cockroaches...

 This was a sad episode of Zvezda... It was funny when she said, "No problem, desu". xD Don't be a naughty child! Roboko x Robo Butler is OTP!

 So much happened in the final episode! Kate being bad-ass... Kate being bad-ass... Kate being angry... Zvezda being bad-ass... White Light being bad-ass... Kate being cute... Kaori being cute...

 It's finally here! The OVA! Will my Asuta x Renge shipping bear fruit?! Idol group? We have loli finger already, also we have a Hatsune Miku character already - Roboko - in the Zvezda army! Look at her blush, so cute. The mechanical spring in her step and her artificial giggling is adorable. Where the hell did Renge come from, whatever, it's Renge! Yay! Is Kate trying to say the "re" in "do re mi fal so la ti do"?! That's so precious. Roboko has such nice body language, trying to cover up her absurd posters of that idol group she likes. Why would a robot need huge stuffed animals in her room? WTF Roboko doesn't even have a movable mouth, how can she smile? Oh my God, Kate you're so vulgar! lol The building has a sign on it that just plainly reads "Zvezda HQ". Love the subtle comedy there. How the hell is there sweat on the outside of the gas mask?! I love how they have that following the cliche "step on the noisy object while sneaking" trope. WTF she just regressed to a child, that was alarming! Of course Natasha has some magical Udo door lock ****...and traps...and alarms. Ha, what a censor screen...too cute. What was up with that blush after Roboko's humble bow? Lesbian alert? Did she write the kanji for person and then kiss it? I love how human Roboko can act. Gorou's back...well **** man, why'd it have to be then? xD Okay I was a bit disappointed that we didn't get to see the entire song on Roboko's audition...but after that scene with Kate and Roboko both crying, I expected something "idol" but not a whole freakin' CGI performance! Are you kidding me? When I saw the major cast members dancing in the background I laughed out loud. So ridiculous. Ha, decent ending dialogue/banter between Kate and Asuta. They always have sweet conversations. This unaired episode, although it didn't contribute much to the after-plot of the original run, was still entertaining. Where's my Renge x Asuta though? I liked how they worled together a lot this episode, but c'mon. I heard rumors about a season two for this anime? That'd be excellent.
