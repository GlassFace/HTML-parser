[General Discussion] Homophobe: Overused?
 I think why the term is used so often is because people have the mentality of "You're either for us or against us." To them, you HAVE to pick a side. But with these kinds of issues, as with most issues, sometimes you just don't want to pick a side. You have no vested interest in what is being gained or lost. It doesn't affect you and you do not wish to get involved in something that doesn't necessarily concern you. As for me, I am bi or pan, both are sorta of the same thing. Although I support LGBT rights, I don't go crazy and shove it in people's faces. Let the people who want to support, support. It's not bad to rally support, but to label people who don't support as "homphobes" is only hurting the cause. It alienates people and causes a divide.

That is stupid to call you a homophobe because you do not wish to make a career of having sex with men on camera. You're not comfortable with that. I'm not comfortable with working with children, but that doesn't mean I hate children. I just do want that as a career choice.  Spoiler Interestingly enough, a lot of male gay porn stars are actually straight. They will usually have their wives or girlfriends just off camera giving them shows so they can maintain arousal. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OPossum | Homestuck
