[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Dang, crazy episode. I wonder if any of the JIORians piloted Haruto's or Cain's units, would experience the withdrawal symptoms Haruto gets? Although who knows since apparently Cain took the AI/ghost out of Unit 2 and seems to be using it for other purposes now anyway. I do wonder if they modified/replaced the core in Unit 1 with one like the other four units have, if it'd be safe from Rune loss? Was kind of surprised when the AI chick said L-Elf wouldn't work either, I had been suspecting the Karlstein school was the same thing as the JIORian high school colony block. The volcano bit was hilarious and felt like something straight out of Code Geass S2.
