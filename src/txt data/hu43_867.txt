[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 I love that the idol in the story (Rukino Saki) is played by an actual Sony-signed singer (Tomatsu Haruka) and they have her sing in the show. Check out her Good Luck for You rendition in Episode 5. Awesome!
