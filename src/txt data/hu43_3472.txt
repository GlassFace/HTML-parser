 Gundam x Hip Hop Designs
 Earlier this month I decided to finally create the fan art I always wanted, or at least design something that I would want to have on a tshirt. That's right, a Gundam shirt that had some Hip Hop flavor. After I was done with the first design, however, I knew that I couldn't just stop with the original Gundam because there were so many other mobile suits in the original series along. So one by one I started to design more, and I am still in the process of making more. I love Gundam and I also love Hip Hop culture as it's been a great outlet for my creativity visually, musically, and with dance. I hope some of you can appreciate these designs I made. Feel free to check out the link below the image if you think you may want a shirt with one of these designs on it. https://www.teepublic.com/user/EasterlyArt
