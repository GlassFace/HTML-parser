[General Discussion] Thanks for 10 years! Mod appreciation!
 It's amazing that A4 has been around for 10 years! So many memories and I just want to say thank you to all the mods and admins who have kept up with the forums and have done their job amazingly! A4 would never be able to run properly without our hard working mods and admins! I just want to show my appreciation and I hope others do too! A4 has been like a second home to me and I've made many friends along the way! THANK YOU MODS AND ADMINS FOR BEING AWESOME.
