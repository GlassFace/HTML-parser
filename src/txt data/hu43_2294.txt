 Teen Sues Parents For College Tuition
 Or selfish, entitled children general thread. http://shine.yahoo.com/parenting/nj-...201404488.html A New Jersey teenager claiming that her mother and father tossed her out of their home and cut her off financially is using them for immediate support, current private-school fees and future college tuition. The parents, meanwhile, say that daughter Rachel Canning, 18, moved out voluntarily after refusing to abide by their rules. We love our child and miss her. This is terrible. Its killing me and my wife, Rachel's father, Sean Canning, a town administrator and retired police officer, tells the Daily Record. We have a child we want home. Were not Draconian and now were getting hauled into court. Shes demanding that we pay her bills but she doesnt want to live at home, and shes saying, I dont want to live under your rules. The rules, he notes, include reconsidering her relationship with a boyfriend who may be a bad influence, being respectful, and abiding by her curfew. He and his wife, Elizabeth, who live in suburban Lincoln Park, about 25 miles outside of New York City, have kept their daughters car because they paid for it, says Canning, and he admits that they did stop paying Rachel's tuition at the private Morris Catholic High School. A hearing is scheduled to take place on Tuesday in the Morris County Superior Court. Thoughts or opinions on this matter?
