[General Discussion] What type of anime/manga would you make?
 I know I cannot be the only one who has moments that come up with an anime/manga that I think other people would like. What I would like to know is what kind of story you would create if you had a choice. For me, I constantly, day-dream if you call it that, about a protagonist that goes through something that changes him or her and they go to lengths to fix it. Tell me your story ideas down below! ^.^
