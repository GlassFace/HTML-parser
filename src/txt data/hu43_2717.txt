 The art of anime was 10x better back then.
 I was watching movies like wicked city and Akira and even the old gun dam wing shows ,and was so taken back by how great the animation/drawings were back then;it's no contest.Today the art has no anatomy ,they use brightly colors and no details or texture pattern.The cell colors look too digital and has lost all graininess,the exception is shows like Hajime no Ippo which actually brought back that vintage style of art.I wish they could revive some of the old style and get rid of these massive eyes that cover 3/4 of entire person's face,and don't get me started on the 3d mecha robots. Anyways I thought i'd just rant.Vent here.
