[General Discussion] What are your hobbies?
 Many people have hobbies, whether it be to pass time or to have a little fun. My main hobby is writing. Writing anything and everything. I've been doing it since I started watching my very first anime, which was around two years ago. So what's yours, and when did you start it?

 Running: I am a runner by nature and run nearly everyday. Long distance, interval training, sprinting, etc. Been doing this since High School and have kept with it throughout my College and the Marine Corps. Shooting: A firearms enthusiast (with a particular love for revolver shooting), I enjoy the challenge of quick pistol marksmanship as well as long-range pistol shooting. I grew up in Tennessee... shot competitively in High School in the Junior Olympics (rifle). I didn't discover my love for pistol shooting until College. Piano: This is more of my passion than a hobby. I love music, particularly music for the piano. I'm self-taught and have been playing for 10 years. Video Games: I play anything from Final Fantasy to Call of Duty to Rome 2 Total War... anything except sports games. My brother and I have been asked to join a professional Call of Duty team or two in our time, but alas, we have other priorities. Martial Arts: I studied Heiwado Karate for 5 years (in college) achieving 2nd degree brown belt, but didn't have the time to progress further (USMC). I actively participate in MCMAP, but miss the environment of Heiwado-ryu; I still practice a Kata every now and then. Philosophy: Studied Mathematics, Logic, and Law in College and I try to maintain a steady regiment of reading, but it tapers off when I get busy. Anime: Of course!

 My #1 hobby: Relaxing... but in a world with responsibilities and requirements... that isn't something I can do... 2nd would be sleeping because that is closest to relaxing. 3rd would be gaming/music, followed by anime :3 
Anime watched: 73 My Youtube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/Uatemydoodle Kpop Thread: http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...4-K-pop-Anyone 
 My hobbie is probably always looking for a hoobie lol. I have always been jealous of people who have a hobbie and are super into it. I seem to always be searching for my hoobie. I get into something then soon lose interest and start another hobbie. It gets really annoying. 

 Some of my favourite hobbies/interests and activities I enjoy are: 1. Gaming; commonly FPS, MMORPG, RPG 2. Anime/Manga 3. Visual novels/Otome games 4. Beauty/Makeup 5. Working out at the gym (to lose weight and tone my arms/legs) 6. Sports; tennis, badminton, basketball, swimming and netball 
 
 Most are tv related (anime, stand up specials, dramas like breaking bad/game of thrones, ect), listening to music and been tryng to be a better artist for some time now 
 I collect transformers and power ranger megazords but my newest hobbie is knife collecting.

 I played soccer in high school, but stopped for a while entering college. Just when I thought I was done with soccer, my friend called me up to play in his indoor team. I realized how much I love this sport. So i'm starting to play soccer again and practicing to join some leagues. Pretty much soccer is my hobby as of now. Other hobbies: Music, games, anime, and occasionally play other sports to build up my stamina. 
 I like to collect black metal albums. Black metal is unique in music in the fact that albums from black metal groups can command a lot of money and are rare in the number allowed for circulation. I own almost 300 individual black metal albums. Three of those have only 100 copies on Earth and I own several more that have only 1,000. I even own a complete discography of an artist whose work is extremely limited in number and highly sought after. Just those 13 albums by that artist alone are worth around $10,000. And those are only 13 of the almost 300 I own. I own pieces from Australia, to Iraq, to Japan, and beyond. I have pieces from almost ever country on the planet. I enjoy watching animated sitcoms. I am usually fairly picky in this regard and watch only what I have heard good reviews on. I play video games as most people do. But I usually only play half of the year. I will typically have six months where I play almost all of the time. And then, I get bored and take a break from another six months before I pick up the controller again for another six months of nearly non-stop play. I enjoy trying to find good horror films. The freakier, the better. I like the ones that mess with your head more than your stomach. I read.....a lot. I enjoy graphic novels, comic books, non-fiction, fiction, you name it. Right now, I am reading through the Vampire Chronicles as well as catching up on some indie comics and DC comics. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OPossum | Homestuck

 I race remote control cars and I'm pretty good at it. My current car is a TOP Photon EX and I'm looking at a more powerful motor in it later in the year.

 I write a collection of inter-related high fantasy stories and supporting material. I enjoy a bit of gardening, but this hobby is impeded at the moment by evil forces. I like to go hiking, sight-seeing, bird-watching, or fishing on the weekends if weather permits. I like to relax in the shade on bright, sunny days and watch things pass by. Some anime, video games, TV, movies, etc., but I would hardly call them a hobby--more like a past-time. I also like to research and learn random things that piques my curiosity during the day. I also have a bird and some fishes.

 喜びの糸はカノン紡ぎ出す
 Writing- Something I picked up in 3rd grade. I don't do it much anymore because now I usually think about what to write extensively before doing so. Drawing- Also started in 3rd grade, I draw everyday usually (although they're anime doodles). Once in a while I get up and paint. Also I take art lessons at this place called The Center. It's near a forest, so we get inspiration from the forests. Nearby is a church, so when the bells chime it is a very calm atmosphere. Anime- why else would be on this forum. Also annoying the c*** out of everyone in my class is a speciality of mine. 
 So many books, so little time.
 I keep fish (I currently have 3 freshwater tanks, might get more later lol) and reptiles (3 snakes, a gecko and a frog) I also read nonfiction avidly. I know, I have old people hobbies lol 
 Both Thanks to Sl33py =3 My Tumblr Click me and feed some needy shelter animals, for FREE! 
 i play magic the gathering work on my old muscle car kendo 
Do you know whats the difference between a king and his horse? INSTINCT!!! Hollow Ichigo (Bleach) 
 Hobbies Eh? Writing: I'm in the process of writing my own book at the moment, though i'm taking it slow due to lack of inspiration. Gaming: To be honest, 8 times out of 10, I will be planted in front of a computer screen playing games People watching: I don't want to sound like some kind of pedo when I say that, but I just love watching people act like idiots, it makes me laugh so much. Listening to Music: I pretty much have music on all the time, for background noise, or even just to get lost in and hear every beat and sound of it, analyze every tiny part, and try to memorize each tune. Watching Anime: Of course I like doing this, after all I'm on A4, and Really why I enjoy it, is because I can connect with almost each main protagonist of each series I watch in one way or another, and use the series as almost a teaching tool for myself. Trying New food: What can I say? I just love to taste and try food, sometimes I regret it when I eat certain things, but in the end i'm satisfied knowing i can say "I ate (insert most disgusting image here)" Talking to myself: In the end when I get extremely lonely and bored I resort to talking to myself for enjoyment, usually right before I sleep. And finally, Birds: I just love birds so much, I feel like I have some kind of connection with them, and honestly, I get jealous, because sometimes I just wish I could soar high, like a hawk, or look down upon others, Like a looming crow. 
 Reading, computer crap (a little gaming,sql, getting banned on the occasional forum), building stuff (rebuilt our kitchen aftr a fire, building a playhouse, etc). Alot of random stuff. 
 Hmm so many things i do i couldn't call them all hobbies, lets began with a short list then. -Gaming;FPS,MMORPG,Strategy. -Reading;Psychology,Philosophy -Star gazing -Eating -Sleeping 

 -Writing. I've always loved fantasy, and I used to do really well in creative writing. I've won a few awards at my local bookstore when they held creative writing competitions, too. Lately I haven't done much due to massive amounts of writers block. I hate it. -Learning. Sounds kinda weird, but I love researching things and building my knowledge. That said, I don't really perform well in an educational environment; for the most part forced learning doesn't help me. 3 years of history classes revolving around the first and second world wars, but I still can't tell you much about them. However, I have a pretty strong knowledge base of the middle ages, despite not being taught it. -Reading. As I mentioned above, I love fantasy. If I'm not doing anything else, I usually have my face in a book of some description. I'm currently reading Faith of the Fallen by Terry Goodkind. It's great, but I kind of messed up because it's book 6 of a series I haven't read the earlier titles of. Whoops. -Gaming. I'm a huge RPG fan, so they take up a lot of my time. I also enjoy anything that makes me think, so strategy games and MOBAs are pretty awesome. -Swordplay. I love weapons. I love collecting them, I love holding them, I love taking photos of them, I love practicing with them. My bedroom looks like an armory. I initially got into them as a sort of empowerment belief/coping mechanism after being bullied in school, resulting in the bully assaulting me with a wooden bat. That was ten years ago, and shortly after that event I bought my first pair of swords in a curio store. Then over time I've built up quite a collection of swords, daggers, a spear, and an axe. I also own a pair of 18th century flintlock pistols I bought in a charity shop for £30; got them valued and they're worth approx. £2500, which is cool. -Anime, obviously. 
 Current Hobbies include: - Cooking - Playing the Ukulele - Collecting Bicentennial Quarters - Collecting Wheat Pennies - Collecting State/National Park Quarters - Work Hobbies I want to get into: - Training (Running/Workout Basics/Biking) - Parkour - Swimming - Long Boarding - Build Mobile Suit Gundams - Sewing/Knitting I do watch Anime/Movies/Telly Shows, play Video Games, and Read (Fiction, Comic Books, Classics, and Humor), but I just never really considered them as hobbies....

Balance.... I'm losing it.....The ground beneath does not exist.... If this isn't nice, then I don't know what is....  Spoiler  Spoiler "The whole story has it that as we go through life, we really don't change.... We just become more of the same.... You look around you as the years go by and it seems a very valid premise.... People don't change.... As a matter of fact most of us resist change very strongly.... Yet change is a sure thing.... The only variable rate.... Slowly read as evolution and fast as revolution...." 
 I honestly don't have many hobbies. Gaming was one of my biggest hobbies, but my passion towards it has slowly dwindled away. I would really like to find a new hobby to enjoy. I think my hobbies are rather boring.

 Sleeping-Who doesn't love sleeping? Writing-Always enjoy writing stories and fan fictions Tennis and soft ball-love it! 

 I have many hobbies. All which I usually share with my friends. Movie production: I like to dabble with After Effects and my brother does a lot of work editing work for his job. So, we get our friends together and make some short films usually a handful every year. Some become comedies based on which one of my brothers wrote the story. Sports: I have loved sports since I was young, so I will always be involved with them. I prefer to play football, basketball, volleyball, and soccer. Vacations: These are the best! Just to get away from college and my job for a little bit is always nice. Especially with my friends. Going camping or to the beach is always a great experience. And of course anime =D 
 Martial arts, fighting, free running, climbing, conditioning, working out and everything alike. Video games, movies, anime and all the music that goes with it. Almost all other music as well. Guitar! Fixing things, electronic and mechanical etc. It is kind of my hobby to help people wherever i can because it makes me happier, but to a certain extent, because i also like making people stronger so i do not want to make life easy for them. There is probably more stuff to say....
