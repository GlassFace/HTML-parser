 Favorite character(s) in all of the Big 3 - Page 2
 The big 3 in anime is without a doubt famous for all of it's characters. These characters are famous for their humor, character, uniqueness, etc. We all remember shows like Yugioh or Pokemon mainly because of the main character. Even though plot and action are important characters seem to make the big 3 more special than other Shonen anime. Here are some of my favorite characters: Monkey D. Luffy Grimmjow Jeagerjaques Monkey D. Luffy is probably one the best leaders in all of anime. He has almost every characteristic of a servant leader and he never gives up. He is wiling to die to become the pirate king and everything he does has purpose for this ultimate goal. On top of that he is hilarious and he always finds a way to make me laugh every episode. Grimmjow in my personal opinion is just awesome. His release form is so amazing and Grimmjow, like Luffy, doesn't take defeat lightly. In fact he's also willing to fight with everything he has all the time. Even though he's not a good guy, he's definitely not a villain. I look to him as an anti-hero, and I look forward to Grimmjow screen time more than Ichigo. Overall both of these characters create a huge impact on the environment around them and they seem to teach me to be unique. But to also not take no for an answer, and have confidence in who you are and for what you stand for.
