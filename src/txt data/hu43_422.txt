 Paper or Digital?
 I was wondering how many people out there actually owned something like a Kindle or other electronic device that allows you to read books without having to carry around the paper hard copy with you everywhere? If you DO own one, do you still find yourself reading paper hard copies out of habit? Do you find yourself reading more or less with said device in hand? Does it strain your eyes to read off an electronic device for extended periods of time? Personally I've never owned one of these devices, mostly because I never find I have enough spare time and money to go about buying one. But I'm sure it'd be neat to have in any case, especially when I have to carry around large quantities of bulky textbooks which make my backpack feel like it's made of lead. Please share your experiences with this backwards, hillbilly 24-year-old that I may be further enlightened in regards to these new-fangled steam or electric powered reading devices.
