[General Discussion] Which is the best party activity?
 So I was thinking about parties, mostly because so many friends birthdays are comming up now and I feel like doing the usual things at every party might get boring. So I was wondering what other people usually do... What is according to you the best party activities? Is there something special that you find funny or that you usually do? Personally I like to wrestle, dance and watch funny youtube videos at parties. But I dont know many kind of games or so that you can play... Truth or Dare is all I know and that is rather boring when you already know most of your friends secrets (>_<)
