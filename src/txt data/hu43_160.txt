I think Kouketsu made some good points that you need to address, GTO. Apple is a much sneakier and underhanded company than you're letting on. I didn't know I was under some obligation to reply to every single post in this thread. As for Kouketsu's post, I don't know what to say about it. Crazy patients: Apples one of the most successful companies in America, they can make all the silly patents they want. First Smart Phones: Yes, Blackberrys have been around alot more, but iPhone was the first of it's KIND. Perhaps that's a better way to put it. The point is, everyone started copying the iPhone after it became such a success. The only other thing I have to say about his post is that I didn't start this off as a "Apple is better then everyone!" thread, which it kinda makes it look like it is. It's a Gen Apple discussion and I'm not really interested in starting a war. Honestly, I think I made this thread at a bad time. After the while iPhone prototype / Grey Powell thing happened, it gave all these anti-Apple people ammo to attack Apple with. Kinda like Foxconn, which was a TOTAL bias media attack since Foxconn is not the "Apple factory". It's the "Apple, Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo Factory". I think once the iPhone 4 comes out and this anti-Apple hysterics blows over, I might try this again because it seems i'm the only iPhone user on A4.
