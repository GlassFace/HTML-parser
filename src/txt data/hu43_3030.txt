 Feminist games critic cancels talk after terror threat

When you make a precedence of banning material some people find offense and making it illegal for purchase, you have banned an idea. And the process of banning ideas people find offense leads to more control over people's actions and essentially making them take a path that the people who ban materials wants them to take, not necessarily the ones they themselves wish to take. It lays down a terrible framework for future bans and it implies, by banning something, that the few people who banned it know better than the people who once had the option to purchase. It allows others to make the choices for you and what you will do. And that, in itself, is a terrifying concept.
