 Bitcoins?
 As Bitcoin prices charge ever higher, the same people who were dismissing Bitcoin as a "bubble" at $35 six weeks ago are now huffing about it being even more of a "bubble" at $235. Read more: http://www.businessinsider.com/why-b...#ixzz2Q0flMllG The price of Bitcoins has been rising at an insane rate over the past few weeks. I really wish I had machine that could mine these things, but I do not possess a system that can do the math to give me some that raw profit. Does anyone here mine Bitcoins, or have any Bitcoins? And if you're asking yourself "What the hell is a Bitcoin?" Uncle Wikipedia can help you out.

 Wow, it was like 140 last week. Definite bubble here yo, but its hard to get a toe in, lol. It can also go boom at anytime. But the Cyprus fiasco really has people looking into it. I'm guessing people in Italy and Spain are googling it as we speak lol. No way the Authorities are gonna let it be. Probably site its applications in money laundering and drug buying etc to get a grip on it. http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisf...ancial-markets Fantastic article. Anyway, something I will look into, but not really on my to buy list. First heard about it when looking at the 'Silk Road' site. Yeah, can see why the authorities/central banking wankers are weary...

 I wouldn't say it's necessarily a bubble. A bubble implies that a bust is inevitable, this doesn't necessarily have to bust. It could very well be a sign that people are giving up on fiat currencies. After all the price exploded after the Cyrpiot bank account seizures.

 Well, bitcoins like IOU notes are infinite... Interesting how the site being hacked bought the price down and then everyone started going 'hmmmm, we can make money of of this!'

BTC had risen like 300% before that one exchange site had been DDoS'd, and really, all that happened was the site lagged. It doesn't discredit BTC. Also, they aren't infinite. They're "mined" according to an algorithm, and will stop at around 21 million in 2140.

 What can you buy with them? The ideas not bad, but I'm not sure it does much for you until more people accept them for payment. I think people will steadily be taking it more and more if the see the price rise like this though. Hopefully enough to keep it from really bottoming out when people decide to cash out.

 ^ That might be enough actually to keep the market going. You have to keep people using it for actual transactions. I'm not sure there are 2 billion worth of transactions out there, but I could be wrong. At work, I recently met with a trading union that does much the same thing as bit-coin, attempting to replace the dollar with trade credits between members of the union (they've been at it a bit longer). Their biggest concerns were pretty much getting more people in the union and to get members to use the union and their credits, which makes sense. That's what keeps what they're doing worthwhile and it's going to be the same for bit-coin.

 The criminal aspect is the line of attacks the governments are gonna go with when sh1t gets real. http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013...ug-marketplace Apparently it used to have a sister site that sold weapons. You could go on there and go 'how much for the gun from Rambo?' and someone, I assume Nicalos Cage, would answer - 'Part 1, 2 or 3?'

 Well, looks like someone decided to cash out today. As of this post, looks like it's down to $150 then suddenly back up to $190. Lots of volatility right now.

 Is there really a way to short the bitcoin market? Who's lending them out?

He got in around $80/1BTC sold at around $225 and bought again at $160 and i think he's waiting for it to come back up to the 200s to sell again. Of course, that's him. I don't know exactly how many are doing it but the more violent the arbitrage, the more likely it's going to quickly settle on a price soonish. edit: I actuallly just asked him and he said he ended up selling at $165. Still made a profit, though. Overall, he claims to have made about $5,000 off the btc boom. Not bad at all. He's kind of bragging honestly.

Unless there's a way I'm missing to create your own short position. Yeah, that's the technical definition. I was using it kind of liberally for two reasons: 1) Central bank notes are the majority of the assets being exchanged for BTC 2) The process is essentially the same as if it were a security So while it's probably not technically being short sold, it made sense (to me) to use it in this context. apologies for the confusion

 It's alright, I was just kind of interested and surprised. To me, if there were already brokers letting you short this before the widespread adoption of it, you kind of know it's doomed. I'm really curious to know what kind of numbers payment processors have for this stuff now just to see how many people are using it to conduct their business. That really will tell us lots about the market. At least the fundamentals anyway. Edit: Also kind of wondering if panic is going to set in and normal people start dumping them... I definitely wouldn't buy any until the dust settles.

 Hey, way to go jinxing it guys. http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology...igh-losing-160 How long have you guys been aware of Bitcoin? I ask cuz I vaguely remember it when it first appeared (or about 6 months after lol) and people laughed and said maybe it'd take off when the next crash happened. Then completely nothing but in the last month or 2 people have definitely been talking. Literally yesterday someone dropped it in a conversation and people are genuinely interested. Not to mention the plethora of articles/tv segments. I think the up down nature of it will appeal to certain kinds, lol. Also kind of wondering if panic is going to set in and normal people start dumping them... I definitely wouldn't buy any until the dust settles. I'm assuming normal people/non speculators either moved their currency from places like Cyprus (I would love to see the stats on this) or are just laundering anyways. They can can probably take the hit and the ones who've taken it must've taken that risk into consideration. I'll just leave this here since its open and was a cracking read. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania

 Meh, these are what I'd call "economic fundamentals." Knowing the answer to the questions about who is going to use/spend them are what carries you through bubbles and busts.
