 End of gay ban in U.S. military a step closer
 Hmm... as usual my point doesn't get across. The realities of arguing on the internet make themselves apparent to me again. Anyway, sorry to hear only one person here is like, pro-DADT besides me. If you don't like that, then deal with it. And don't call me homophobic, or anti-gay because that's just plain ignorance. Do I want homosexuals to be accepted? Yes. Would I like to see DADT removed someday? Yes. However, I don't think the military in the US is ready yet. There is too many homophobic and ignorant people in the military who'd abuse and attack homosexuals. I agree that this won't really do much. As I said before, it's pointless because all the gay soldiers will just keep mum anyway. Personally, I think it's just a political ploy Obama is using to put something good under his arm for 2012 elections. Something easy that doesn't need congress. Like closing Gitmo (which was a great thing to do, before you jump to conclusions). But again, whatever. In the end it's all up to the soldiers what they do. I'm done with this. *unsub*
