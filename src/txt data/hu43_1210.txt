 What songs would you want played at your funeral?
 Yeah, I know it's a grim question. But I'm interested to see if anyone wants a serious tone at their funeral, or one with a sense of humor. Who doesn't want to go out with a proverbial bang? For me, it's a toss up between three songs:  Spoiler No one can have a funeral without this piece. Blue Oyster Cult all the way. ------  Spoiler <span style="font-family: lucida sans unicode"> This song says everything and more. --- And last, but not least, I have to add a song for all the ladies at the funeral.  Spoiler ----- And for the big finale?!  Spoiler Yup, you bet your @ss this'll be playing for the crowd. You people know this screams badass. --My feelings towards some of these may change.. there's just too many awesome songs to list in a single post. 
Individual Eleven: Rise Up. Never conform. 
 I'd hate for my family to have a funeral for me. I'm dead... its a waste of money, just live life. However a song I thought would be nice for funerals would be: Fairy tail sad theme: Its sad, yet happy and amazing at the same time.

 I'd want song like Euterpe OP from guilty crown, but I'm not Japanese. so we'll just have a song with heavy dubstep bass to drop over my dead body 
 Dubstep Chaos Theory - ShockOne l Siren - Kat Krazy ft Elkka l Faith - BlasterJaxx 
 Why the heck not? 
 Currently Listening To: "Been Caught Stealing" by Jane's Addiction! Things get better things get worse, Life's a blessing life's a curse! Current Weight: 253 pounds! Nothing new! 
 Hey, Life Is Beautiful is a good song. A friend of mine introduced me to Sixx AM some years back. Ha, and it's quite spot on, albeit a sad piece. No happy funny songs from anyone? @No. 2 - Haha, heavy dubstep? Am I to conclude that you'll want a wild party thrown in your honor after death? I can see it now. I'm actually surprised no one put the song "Another One Bites the Dust" by Queen. It's both classic and cliched to hell.

 Time of Dying by Three Days Grace 
 @Pured - OMG, was listening to yours. It sounded so dramatically depressing, I can imagine you in that glass coffin and everyone all solemn + dressed in black Q___Q Just kidding but it sounded heartful Q_Q Well holy sh*t Kyo, this is uber dark. I would want something like Guilty Crown's Krone Or Spirited Away's One Summer Day I think I have a strong connection because I use to play them on the piano a lot ^^; 
 
 I made a thread like this years ago and I think at that time I had Adam's Song by Blink 182. Wasn't a good time when I made that, plus I was young. I think if I was to choose a song now it would have to be one from Approaching Nirvana. They do some really nice uplifting melody tunes. 305 is a good song but I'm not really sure what would work in this situation. 
 Carpenter Brut - Le Perv | David L. Puga - Egg-Shaped Prison(Dr. Robotnik Theme) | Sabrepulse - Milotic - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - "Thank you for riding the Psycho Express, Toot-toot! All aboard, I'll be collecting your tickets, we have beverages in the DINING CAR!!!" - Krieg 
 skynyrd - free bird (must be played first) cece peniston - finally matt & kim - day light kittie - funeral for a friend sandra nasic - right lane guano apes - never born guano apes - kiss the dawn guano apes - heaven mary j blige - everything sun zoo - my time michael jackson - billie jean tasha - black happiness drunken tiger - one summer nite drunken tiger - heaven 8:45 veruca salt - aurora pat benatar - hell is for children janis joplin - call me namie amuro - never end tlc - unpretty aaliyah - more than a woman george thorogoode & the destroyers - one bourbon, one scotch one beer (as long as I didn't die because of too much drinking) fiona apple - never is a promise chie ayado - house of the rising sun (one of my fave covers of the song) aceyalone - changes m-flo - one day boyz II men - end of the road when i die, I suspect the same inner demons I battle now I'll be battling as i draw my last breathe. Most of these songs are symbolic to me for one reason or other namely because they embody a particular attribute or character flaw i harbor already. The aaliyah song... when I die, I want to have finally come to term with my gender issues. I want to be able to die feeling everything it means to be a 'lady' and feeling happy with that status. 
Should've opted out just before the point of ejaculation b1tch. ~ Snap 
 Mine would probably be: You have to get about 12 seconds in to understand why I want this at my funeral.

I think it's an interesting peak at seeing how people want to be remembered? Adam's Song, that's an interesting pick. I hadn't heard of Approaching Nirvana until now, and I have to say they sound pretty good.

Interesting. I like how you put a lot of variety into your choices. Many genres here. It says a lot. And how could I possibly forget Freebird?

And just for shits and giggles, I'd want to have the Legend of Zelda theme played, just for the sake of geekgasms.

I hadn't heard of Approaching Nirvana until now, and I have to say they sound pretty good. They were two guys that lived on opposite sides of the US and never actually met until last year but they were working together to produce music for a while. Their main source of publicity was through YouTube and Channels like FyreUK which used their songs for Minecraft time-lapse videos. I tend to listen to their stuff while working on something as it's not distracting but helps break the silence.

Yeah Kyo it will be miserable until they Haha, yeah tha'd be geeky playing the theme of LoZ. XD

 @Pured - Haha, that was amusing. I like the Navi break down. Even though Navi annoyed the hell out of me. You loved to hate her. I've seen a few of that guy's remixes. I think I like his version of "Song of Storms" best of all. I wish he'd do an overworld dubstep theme for Zelda. That would be badass. Or even a Forest Temple remix. @NuttsnBolts - Ah yes. Youtube; one of man's greater accomplishments, and also one of man's greatest tragedies (I'm looking at you, cinnamon challenge videos...). I'll have to invest some more time into them; I'm on Youtube now sorting through. It is great that it's not really distracting. Any suggestions? Some of their stuff is easy on the ears and doesn't beat you to hell. @DrexzkrisExoiS - ROTFL. Well hey, if I'm willing to have Monochrome Effect by Perfume playing at the funeral, why not? Funerals aren't for crying.. they're for busting moves.. I think. To keep this on the up and up, I found another one in my playlist that would go well at my funeral.  Spoiler I love zombies, and is there a better way to make friends than through complete narcissism? I don't think so!

 Kyo: Lapse in Time: Running, 2nd Flight, Worth a Thousand Pictures Subliminal Message: Even While, Keeping Quiet, Beer They're the most played ones but they're all fairly good. Just looking, Motionless Thoughts would be a good funeral or even celebration song.
