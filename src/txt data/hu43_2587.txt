 Anime Expo 2014!
 So any of you A4 peoples going? I am still trying to get a group of friends together, but I definitely wanna go. The only thing close to this I've gone to is Wondercon and all the other conventions I've gone to are either video game or car ones, so lastly, if anyone has been to an anime con or something, what's it like?
