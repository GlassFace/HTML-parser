 Return of the Living ...damn puns I'm just no good at puns.
 I didn't even bother watching Annabelle. Conjuring was great, I agree. And don't even make me start on Ouija. Damn, I got carried away. Greetings friend. Be sure to have a great time posting and interacting with the community members. No good horror movies lately, sigh.
