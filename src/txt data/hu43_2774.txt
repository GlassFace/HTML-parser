[Personal Life Discussions] What do you think about Online Dating?
 I wasn't sure if I should put this here or in PLD but I decided its similar the other topics lol. So as the title says, What do you think? and I guess you can answer can you do it or what would be the minimum requirements in doing it? Reason why I posted this thread (Don't have to read.) Â Spoiler The reason I decided to ask this was because of two reasons. Thirsty guys on forums and in videos games or thirsty guys online in general. Also not to long ago my only friend who likes anime met a dude online (I'm assuming on some anime forum.) and they apparently started going out. After while she tells me he is being abusive or like yelling at her etc. I'm just thinking you should break up with him, how can he be abusive online? Like seriously its online. My Opinion So I know there are some people out there who are always excited to find opposite sex members but I think that if you want a cute guy/girl then you should use your friend google images. Or you could even use those online dating sites. I personally think if you are going to online date then you should know each other for at least 1.5-3 years online and then meet up in RL for about 6-12 months before you start. I do know that there are many online relationships that works out. I've heard a few CoD relationships even work out lol. So if I ever met anyone online it would have to be 1.5-3 years online then 6-12 months in RL before I even consider it. 
When they see me rollin. They hatein.
