 Garden of Words / Kotonoha no Niwa
 Saw this movie last night out of pure boredom, and to say the least I enjoyed the story quite a bit - but it was the animation that really got me. Holy ****, that was hands down some of the best animation i've ever seen. It was some next level ****. Literally every seen was like this: Â Spoiler However, I felt as though the entire movie in general was a bit short, only being around 45 minutes . Because it was so short, I didn't really get to become as attached to the characters as I had wanted to (which is sad because I liked the personality of both the characters / their designs). Also, the main song is really, really addicting. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lioo4-lR3TA Yeah, just had to get this out there haha, and wanted to know everyone elses' thoughts on the movie.

 Yeah I had to instantly watch this when I realized it was out. You figure if it was made by Makoto Shikai (5cm per second) you knew it was going to look gorgeous and pull out some feels as well. I wish it was longer as well, but what was conveyed in 45 minutes I thought it was very successful, definitely Something I would recommend to anyone.

 Kinda reminded me of the art from high school on the dead. Nice!
