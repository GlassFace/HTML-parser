 Requesting a Romance Anime - Page 2
 I haven't watched a good romance in a really long time. Last romance I watched was Ao Haru Ride about two months ago or whenever it ended. Before that I watched Golden Time and started Nisekoi. Either way I'm interested in a good romance with (hopefully) a decent ending and maybe some good artowrk ad animation would be a nice plus. I'm pretty much open to everything, so please feel free to recommend anything you have watched and enjoyed. Some popular anime I've already seen: Love Hina Sakurasou no pet Kanoja Hanasaku Iroha (currently watching but im stalling on it lol) Zero no Tskaima Golden Time Inari, kon kon, Koi Iroha kaichou wa maid sama Mysterious Girlfriend X Toradora Say I Love You Clannad Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai Amagami SS Baka and test (something like that) Angel beats
