[Action] Samurai Flamenco
 This is a very seinen series, I will say that Raul. It's not going to appeal to the mass majority of anime viewers, and its humor is probably drier than most younger viewers are used to. To me it's hilarious, but I'm also a professional in my 30's. And with that... Flamenco Girl... is shining!
