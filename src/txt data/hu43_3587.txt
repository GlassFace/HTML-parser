 Vegeta vs Hulk!
 I honestly don't think it would be remotely close. Vegeta could have destroyed a planet by the very beginning of Dragon ball Z series with the power that he had. That's not even mentioning how powerful he becomes by the end of the series. And no I'm not counting GT. I could be wrong but I don't think Hulk ever possessed that kind of power. I don't know that much background on Hulk though. I've only seen the movies. Still, it's not even a fight in my mind.
