 Scared or Nervous Around the Opposite Sex?
 When I was a kid, I had the same anxious feelings many of you are saying do now. In time, they went away. The simple fact is, that when you start working, odds are you will be talking to all kinds of people in order to do your job, so you learn how to deal with the fear fast. Believe it or not, the best I found on how to deal with this outside of jumping into it cold turkey is to attend conventions. Find the game room, find someone looking to play a game, and join them. I do this all the time these days; jump into a game with 4 or 5 complete strangers. A great game, if I may, to do this with is Battlestar Gallactica. If you have a full crew, then it's possible for 2 people to be Cylons. Your job is to figure out who and stop them whilst surviving everything the game throws at you. It forces you, however, to talk to the other players. There is no way you can play that game without working with the other players to solve the problems the game throws at you. Last time I attended Totalcon, I got into a game on Saturday night, and out of everyone at the table, I only knew two by reputation. Had a blast (no pun intended), despite losing (I was a Cylon, and I had them fooled the entire game).
