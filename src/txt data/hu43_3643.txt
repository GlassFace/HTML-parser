[Anime] Do you get the same satisfaction when you marathon a show as you do going slower?
 I get the same satisfaction for both I guess, Sometimes when I just lose interest in the story I feel like finishing it would be a drag. But I just leave it for maybe a day, Start something else and then go back to it. It feels refreshing then ! For me anyway.
