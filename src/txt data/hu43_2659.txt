 Bokurano: Ours
 The manga to this is supposed to be way better and less confusing. I might check that. I remember seeing a bunch of episodes on fansubs back in the day but it was ultimately dull and the characters were highly unlikable on the whole. Also, I honestly hope someone wrecked the robot host thing. Christ, I hated him. Anyway, loved the bit where... Â Spoiler the kids robot tears open one of the 'invading' robots and....its full of children like them! Epic ****ing scene.
