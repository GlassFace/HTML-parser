 Syndra is sad you all forgot about her when talking about burst champions. Fairly sure she has the potential to do the most burst in the game. There's a graph somewhere but that's for level 6 so I'm not 100% sure. So sad EG got beat by Fnatic. I bloody hate Fnatic now. EG better get to Worlds. 
 Well what you can say. Fnatic is a good team. That Xpeke I've seen Fnatic crush Asian teams before I would love them to go to worlds imo, they have a really weird play style that seems to work great versus Asians.

 They're good and I'd enjoy seeing them win vs Asian teams, 'cause Europe yo, but I don't like them that much compared to other teams. Also now it's between EG and GG who get the third spot. ****. I can see EG pulling it off but that means no GG. That sucks. It will be good to see how LD compare to Asian teams though.

I picked up Syndra again yesterday, and I've got to say, she's hella fun. Q > W > Q > R is enough to murder any squishy ever.

In that sense, Corki, Lucian and Ez are in the same category in that they're skill based ADC's and are 100% fully utilized as such. It's why you're supposed to build a Sheen on them and it's why they have dashes that force them to go "all-in" or to "disengage". They're not the kinds of Champions you're supposed to sit there and auto attack with, they're the kind of Champions that do burst ADC Damage and Auto Attack while waiting for resets as well as for kiting. If a bruiser jumps on a Corki, Lucian or Ez, they can take them down while Ashe and Caitlyn can't really do that. Just remember, the kit is just as important as the items you get. Any champion in the game can be built as any role, but you build to maximize their kit. it all depends on how often you'll be hitting your q's with ez. If you hit your q 100 percent of time then yeah it would make sense. 
 There are traditional adc champs and then there are adc champs that are essentially just ad casters, but aren't called ad casters because their role is adc so that title takes precedence. Ez is one such champ.

 I decided to take somebodys advice...(I forgot whos) and wait out some games instead of automatically wanting to surrender. Seems to work out well for me at least. I keep forgetting that late game some champs are almost an unstoppable force when they get their build right and it turned up in our favor. My last 3-5 games ended up that way. One person feeding that doesnt know what their doing, game looks like we have no chance, stick to it and get our farm up while protecting turrents, and somehow we ended up making a comeback. Guess I still have a lot to learn about this game if I couldnt even figure that out myself.

 The power of hyper carriers.... And how we love them 
Why do feeders exist in MOBA's... Why can't they all die? 
 This is what NA and EU might be up against, how many doublelifts do we have again I hope atleast 5 THISSSS ISS SHYYYYYY

 Does Shy still play Singed? I can't recall ever seeing him again since the nerfs. NA Playoffs should be brutal. I want TSM to go to Worlds but at the same time I can't imagine a Worlds without Doublelift and ****. But **** it, I prefer Dyrus and TheOddOne to all of CLG despite disliking Reginald. 
 F*ck TSM, Go CLG. Honestly I just want TSM to lose their sh1t so they can finally realize that it wont work out with their current roster. Dyrus deserves a better non-bullying team.

 The problem is that Regi is the problem, and there won't be a TSM without Regi. Best case scenario I could see happening is Dyrus and others leaving TSM for other teams, but considering the sponsorship stuff, the tv show, the gaming house, etc. it's a hell of a lot of perks you're losing for a gamble. 

 Not denying that, if a team like Curse or CLG would pick up Dyrus for their second team or even main roster would still be the same as TSM, except for the gaming show. It would also be pretty enjoyable.

 Can't see CLG or Curse being interested in him though, they have solid top laners in Nien and Voyboy. The top NA teams all have pretty amazing top laners, really. You need to get into the teams being relegated, like Coast and Velocity to find top laners who'd be replaceable with Dyrus, and there's no reason he'd be interested in joining teams like them given they have way more problems than top lane. Maybe if he could transition to jungle or mid, or even support, he could find someone's spot to take on an NA team, but top lane and ADC are positions where most of the NA teams are really solid. 

 Thats true I've never seen this video, they are actually really chill in game, it has subs. Instead of screaming they just communicate

 Oh yeah, the rewards are based on the highest tier you ever reached during the season. Guess I don't need to worry about being shamed when I return to the game for not playing for a few months and my LP decaying enough to drop me all the way down to bronze (I assume, as I haven't checked).

 HA! bronze! NEVER go to bronze. You don't want to be there, trust me *shivers*

 I hate lolnexus. Every time I play a normal now I get camped 24/7. They see that I'm plat 5 while the rest of my team is silver/gold, so the jungler just stays in my lane nonstop. Teammates rage as they lose their own lanes and yeah, it's just retarded. I imagine it's 50 times worse for diamonds.
