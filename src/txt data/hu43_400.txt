 The World God Only Knows, CUT SHORT
 Yaw, This is one of my favorite anime series, they could've just made 52 episode, actually they could make as many episodes as One Piece an I would watch them all, Kutsuragi is more interesting than that Monkey fellow from One Piece anyway, it is one of the best anime series ever, I just love Elsee, she is so adorable too.
