[Adventure] Pokemon Origins
 Even though it was kind of morally streamlined like an episode of Thomas the tank engine, the battle choreography was just amazing... I think the real reason a lot of people like this though is just the extra attention on the Pokemon world that most people know, the games. The anime always seemed to be sort of disparate fromthe story and experience of playing the games, but this got as close as I think it's ever been... Magnanimous, progressive, angsty and just sort of exhilarating and satisfying on a really basic level... Still pissed that Red lost to green in that first match though. Some players may be that scrubby but I've never lost to a rival in any pokemon game... Also I always name them Scotty. 'Cause Scotty doesn't know, Scotty doesn't Know, so don't tell Scotty~
