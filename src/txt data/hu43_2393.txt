 Ova is out!!!! And let me say...its fantastic!!! 

 OVA was decent, I saw it yesterday and felt nostalgia from when I read the manga. The thing is, right now the manga's story is really bad. Check it out and give some feedback if you want. Whoever enjoyed the AMAZING anime should totally read whatever they can of the manga as well. 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils? Join Super-Powered and get in on the action!  Spoiler http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...-Super-Powered 
 You sound a little sarcastic with that AMAZING haha. Not a fan I take it? 

 I'll have to check it out this weekend. I'm in the middle of infinite stratos two and it'll take me some time to finish it. I really liked the kawaii complex. It wasn't rushed and the side characters were a blast. Thanks for the ova notice.

 @Sora No, no. I'm genuine. I loved the anime adaptation, it was everything I wanted it to be and more. As of the moment, I miss the good parts of the plot that the manga and anime covered because currently, the story is trash.

 I'm quite happy their relationship actually progressed (despite slowly), unlike some other series. The ova did good summarising the mc's relationship with all the girls at that point. I'd welcome a season 2 if they have such plan!

 awww that was cute! Watching the ova was a great way to bring back the memories of the show. I just loved the reactions of both usa and ricchan. Yeah i don't know jugger there really isn't much to the show. Oh don't get me wrong I'd watch more but another season seems like a stretch to me. This ova was a good little journey back to that world. Now if they did an actual movie of some type that could be fun. Or another ova. I just don't know what they could do with a new season. Though they'd have to finally go out on a real date I guess.......... does anybody else have flashbacks to the opening of READING RAINBOW when watching the show opening?????

 I caught up with the Manga, I gotta say the plot development is not good, but now we're in this NTR stage where they have added Takanashi and Shiina, which I am not opposed too at all, it just adds to the drama of this Manga...and it pisses me off that these two are getting father apart thanks to some bullshit miscommunications.

Have they even dated yet? Officially? I mean the main characters.

 OMG Sora, once again we agree on something. I said it before and I'll say it again, the romance has deviated to just irritating drama where even the minor characters are useless and unfunny. The NTR bro and sis aren't really mean or nasty, but their introduction just derailed the entire light drama that had already existed within the plot. Usa and Kawai are ****ing idiots.

They're freaking morons bro, they're stupid jealously is ridiculous. It doesn't help that Mayumi is a B***H and wants to ruin everything but damn she's getting annoying too. 

 I completely agree, Mayumi was always irritating to me. She may be a milf but the moments where she shamelessly did something so awful was just not funny at all, it was repulsive.
