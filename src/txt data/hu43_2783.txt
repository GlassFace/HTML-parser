 Dear A4
 Every so often someone signs up proclaiming they are going to make an anime of their own. Sometime they even try to recruit A4 members. That never ends up well. So, your ambition will probably be laughed off a few times here. Few questions to determine how serious you are; What qualifications have you obtained (or working to obtain?) How do you plan to fund your project? What experience have you had as a team leader? What compromises are you willing to make to your vision? Just some very basic questions which should be easy to answer.
