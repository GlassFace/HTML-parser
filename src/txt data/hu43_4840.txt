 2014 - A4 Annual Awards. - Discussion Thread.
 Hey guys, I spent some time putting up some of the polls last night. A volunteer is going to put the rest of them up in the next couple of days. If they don't get around to it, I will do on the weekend. We went through them and tried to make sure that people actually contributed in the area that they were nominated to avoid all the crap I had to deal with last year. Max number on the polls was 5, in some there are 6. Some wild cards were added also where there were only a few nominees. We went through the forums and looked to see who was contributing in various areas. That's what took so long to get the polls in place... and my lack of time overall. Also note, anyone who was voted as Best New Member and Member of the Year were added to one poll only as those two are very closely related. Same went for the Roleplay polls.
