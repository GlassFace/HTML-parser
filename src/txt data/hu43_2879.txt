 Shiki: I need reviews

It showed the priest and the doc more than it showed Natsuno. But the art was weird as far as hair goes but I don't know, the feel I got from it was unsettling so I guess that's why I liked it, enough to have watched it twice back to back. And I like Michelob Ultra (Cactus Lime). Lol.
