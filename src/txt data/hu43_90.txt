 If you had the Death Note?
 Lets say the Death Note was real and one just fell in front of you and you figured out thats its a notebook that if you write a persons name down they die. Would you continue to use it and if you did would you use it for good or evil or would you never touch it again cause you couldn't take a life no matter what?
