[General Discussion] Why is there so much anger?
 It is not that people are more prone to anger, it is more on point that fewer people have impulse control in today's society. The lack of impulse control can be attributed to many factors such as modern child rearing practices, modern stress, or even the abundance of media influence in the every day lives of the average person. It is not that there is more anger, it is more that people are not taught safe outlets for that anger or they just do not care. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
