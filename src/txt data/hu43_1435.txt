[General Discussion] What are/were you like in high school? - Page 3
 I was the kid that was constantly failing every subject but somehow passed each year 
 I am a quiet one who people think is sad, even though i'm just neutral I've been told I walk like a zombie because I don't move my arms whilst walking I just let them hang and because of my facial expressions, I don't smile at all I'm currently looking for a place in the school which is quiet and has no-one around because I find all people annoying, other than my best friend of course. I do my work quietly and I get on pretty well with people I ALWAYS leave homework to last minute usually the previous night and I have never been in a fight but I broke up one by picking up the two people by the back of their shirts and separating them, I hate break and lunch because I don't really eat at break and lunch is 40 minutes long I like watching what happens at school it can be interesting 
 I was the quiet one, pfh at least I got good grades
