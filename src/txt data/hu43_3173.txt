[Fantasy] Seiken Tsukai no World Break
 Seiken Tsukai no World Break (聖剣使いの禁呪詠唱) is a Japanese light novel series written by Akamitsu Awamura and illustrated by Refeia. SB Creative has published six volumes since November 2012 under their GA Bunko imprint. An anime television series adaptation by Diomedéa is scheduled to air from January 2015. A manga adaptation will be serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Comp Ace magazine. The series takes place in a private high school involving the concept of "saviors." They are known as people who possess awakened memories of their past lives. The story tells of a young boy named Moroha Haimura who comes to this private school. At the school, there are two types of people: Saviors, who fight enemies with weapons and techniques gleaned from the Puraana powers from their own bodies, and Kuroma, who wipe out enemies with magic to manipulate the Maana powers that surpass physics. Moroha Haimura is the first person with past lives of both Shirogane and Kuroma. The main voice cast: Kaito Ishikawa as Moroha Haimura Ayana Taketatsu as Satsuki Ranjo Aoi Yuuki as Shizuno Urushibara Yui Ogura as Maya Shimon Maaya Uchida as Haruka Momochi

 A bit too generic. Getting tired of the settings 
For your freedom, for my honour. MY HYPERWEAPON WILL PIERCE THROUGH THE HEAVEN!! - Rance 
 A solid a cast...ill give it a shot for that reason only. 

 But this one is completely different, it is set in a private high school, PRIVATE OMG. I will give it a shot, I do like the art work.

 I'll just keep watching it . . . I'll avoid making comment but so far it is still enjoyable.

 This show is terrible, I'll give it one more episode because I am curious of the relationship between Male MC and Red hair. But I cannot stand the sister. The animation sucks, and the acting is not very good which is surprising. 

 Not even a beach episode could save this anime. Good night World break. 

 I really do not see why people dislike it so much as far as being generic goes. I like it. It is way better and least generic out of the three major fantasy school life animes that I have seen this season--yes, I am looking at you, Fafnir and Absolute Duo. For an anime of this type, it is doing pretty well to avoid the usual generic subplots/devices, and for the things that it does different, I find it entertaining enough to like. The harem end actually seems canon rather than just one dominant girl with a bunch of vague loose ends for other girls. This is one of the main things that bother me about most harem animes in general, such as Chrome Shelled Regios. Furthermore, the relationships are at least founded on memories of past lives rather than just random love at first sight--especially if the girl was spotted naked for no reason, Fafnir and Blade Dance are good examples. That brings me to the next point. The ecchi part is not too over done. They are not trying to shove it in your face for no reason every chance they get. It is slightly more tame than what I have seen lately in most series. One of the best parts is that the main character is decently manly enough, especially when dealing with his love interests. "Imma bust through your wall and take off with ma waifu." Most other main characters are too shy or nervous to even touch their girls outside of extreme situations. Speaking of that, the main character is actually alpha enough in terms of abilities rather than just on par or below his harem with the occasional and situational leaps up. Loli can drive. She can be my getaway driver any day. That is all I can think of for now out of 5 episodes. Beach episode is an anime classic, so that does not even count.

 Hell, this isn't the best anime but it's kept my interest so I'll continue to watch it. Lots of fan service this episode, but I feel it's just to get it out of the way and continue with the main plot.

 The plot development between minor characters and Moroha is terrible. All of a sudden the super fast chick and the vice president are insanely in love with Moroha. Then there is blonde/boobs who just talks whenever the vice president talks. Loli driving the car was funny I enjoyed that. As for Moroha and his love interests, it's clear who is going to end up winning in the end. Urushibara is clearly CLEARLY better then Satsuki, but because she is pretty much the "main girl" and she has those sister characteristics she'll probably end up with Moroha which is just plain stupid. Whether or not you have an interesting story is definitively a Major part in how an anime will be perceived, however, in my opinion if the animation and/or acting are nauseating, even with a decent story It could not get away with a bad rating. That's how World Trigger is for me, the animation is brutal and the acting is sub-par at best, even with a decent story I had to drop it. 

 Who cares about minor characters? Most of them are just there for comedic relief anyway. And you are completely eliminating the possibility of an actual harem ending, which does happen in anime albeit seldom. Capione! is a good example.

Ive never seen Capione! however now that I know about it's ending I am curious. This could take the route of a harem ending if his "Dark" version takes over, but I just dont see it.
