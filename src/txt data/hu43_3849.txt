 Video Game Highschool
 Anyone else watching/seen the VGHS series by rocketjump? In case you haven't... Video Game Highschool is an hilarious youtube webseries made by Rocketjump. It's based in a futuristic world where the most popular sports are... you guessed it! Video games! Here in this world the Main Character joins up to one of the best Video game schools in the world. VGHS. Personally I give it 5 stars myself, and I highly suggest everyone watch it. The third and final season came out last year and I finally got around to watching it. I cried like a little ***** when it ended.
