 Vegeta vs Hulk!
 Why is this planet-destroying nonsense still going on? Let's entertain th idea that Vegeta can destroy a planet. He does it, and then what? He dies. Hulk survives as he has before. Hulk doesn't even have to do anything to kill Vegeta when the little squirt will do it all on his own.
