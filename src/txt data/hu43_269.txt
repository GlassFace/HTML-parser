[Anime] What are you currently watching?
 I just finished the first episode of MYSTERIOUS CITIES OF GOLD. it looks to me like its gonna be a great adventure show. Ahh the animation style is so 80s. I love it. Brings back good memories Alas I'm watching the dub. I bought it on Google play and it doesn't seem like they do any foreign language tracks. At least not on the animes that I've watched so far on play. Thanks zoltor for the recommendation. Others I'm watching: New: Durarara 2 Log horizon 2 The testament of sister new devil Mari the virgin witch Military! Already aired: Highschool of the dead (finished episode 4 - really like it so far
