 Hacking- What Do You Think, A4?
 Is it right or wrong? Is it ethical? Where do you draw the line that divides innocent research from wrong doing? I'd like to hear what your opinions are, A4. What do you consider "hacking" and what is your definition of a hacker? Do you see it as a display of brilliance or do you see it as a crime regardless of its nature?

 Hacking is hacking into something. And I think it's rarely used in good ethics. Hacking for info or exploiting are messed up, but hacking for theft/fruad is straight up despicable. It is what it is. Some hackers are cool, so are some murderers. If you hack me I will growl at chu. 
 Sure hacking is a crime , but I still think hackers are brilliant , I admire them and wish that I could someday learn how to hack myself .

 This thread is in for a lot of sarcastic and cynical replies. A lot of so-called "hackers" (which is an incredibly vague and ridiculous word) are just a bunch of teenagers who know how to DDoS somebody and like to do it under some guise of "justice" or some **** like that. WE R LEGUN DO NOT FRGV, anon strikes, etc. When really, they're not doing anything worth-while and are just being ****s. Though people who like to leak passwords from websites and ****, are *******s. *******s should not be glorified. Period.

 When I finally got it figured out, I've changed the whole damn plan. "Memorize this! Memorize Jeremiah Gottwald! Commit it to memory, because that's the memorable name of the man who has defeated you."
 So Bri, given what you said, what is your definition of a "hack"? The term is so broad, and I feel like a lot of people have a different meaning for what it is. Anyone, what is your definition?

 Hacking is like break and enter for your home. It's just a cyber version of it.

 Isn't that more cracking then hacking? Cracking as in cracking a safe. Ie a password crack. I would consider hacking anything to do with altering or disabling or stealing part of a program. Either one is illegal. And yeah it's kind of a semantics argument. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 Given how the general public here views it illegally, what would be a legal hack?

 The real unethical part of this equation is how corporations and governments put sensitive information on a system that is inherently unsecured. Anyone who thinks that any part of the internet is secure is very naive. I side with freedom of information, in my opinion the internet is analogous to a public space, take all the photos you want. Where I draw the line is when direct harm is caused to individuals who didn't choose to have the information online, i.e. general consumers. For example, you're bank puts access to your account online, it's not your fault they're risking it and as far as I know you can't opt out. Definition wise, a hacker (in my opinion) is anyone penetrating systems without authorization to gain access to information or control of the system. 
 @reclusive habit - it might be in the banks database but if you never sign up for an online account I wonder if that makes it any safer? Youre not an active user. However the information must still be there for them to offer online access. I wonder if its any safer as a non existent user than a live online account?? Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk

 I see some interesting answers here. Of course, there's no right or wrong answer. Its an ideological view on how people treat modern day technology. Here is another question I'd like to ask and read replies to. What are your thoughts on hacking the PS3? Those who do claim its for research. Others say since they bought the hardware they can do whatever they want to it. Others say its a guise to pirate material in an already declining industry. When the PSN was infiltrated by Anonymous, the world and Sony went into an uproar. The reason they broke into the PSN was because Sony took away the Other OS feature in the PS3 and bluntly went back on their word. When GeoHot was arrested for hacking and cracking the firmware, Sony was quick to take away Other OS and other features the PS3 had that could have been exploited. If anyone is familiar with this story, what are your views on it and do you blame hackers for what happened?

Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk That's somewhat true, though it depends on how the bank's database is setup, in most cases activating your account would mean you've been added to a separate database with you user/password. Computerphile has a good video for none techies explaining password storage:  Spoiler They would still have your account information in a database, though the central database has the highest level of security possible with a large staff of engineers working to keep it that way. As well as it gets "penetration tested" the most. The user database is less secure. Most "hacks" aren't wildly intelligent, it's more of knowing a few vulnerabilities and trying them over and over on different companies. That's why penetration testing is hugely valuable, if you're always trying to "hack" you're self, you're more likely to find when some dev. at the company messed up. The problem is most codebases (all the systems code) are a patchwork of different peoples work with varying degrees of documentation, so the probability of mistakes is inevitable. The only thing a developer can do is develop patterns of work and tools to mitigate the number of mistakes and the severity.

If anyone is familiar with this story, what are your views on it and do you blame hackers for what happened? Ownership legalities in software is beyond crazy stupid. Most of the code I've written, I don't "own". I'm for the "adobe" model, publicly demonize, but don't prosecute. Then when the community around pirating/modding comes up with a good idea, integrate into the main product. Adobe gets young people hooked on pirated software, but when they grow up to become pros they need to by the full versions. It's almost like selling drugs. 
 Like bri said there are alot of "hackers" out there that only do stuff to cause as much harm to someone elses system/network, and I hate them with a passion, there known as Black Hat Hackers they hack illegally and often just to get a kick out of hurting someone elses system or taking there modem down or whatever. Legal hackers or "Ethical Hackers" are hackers who hack their own system and try to repair it as they find any vulnerabilities and is the best way to learn to defend your system because to defend it from a hacker you have to think like one, I only see it as a display of brilliance when done legally. 

 So much misinformation in this thread, you wanna see some real hackers hacking then watch this:

 This is a very sensitive topic; it conflicts both with Freedom of Information and Rights to Privacy. I like both. But when very crucial truth is hidden from the public which could benefit from such information and is hidden behind piles and piles of software/hardware to prevent it from leaking, then I agree that the hacking is justified. But when its to steal from someone (i.e. Me from a random stranger) just for their personal causes, then I am against it. I know it makes little or no sense at all, but its what my brain creates as a response from this...

 I don't understand some of you ... you talk like Hackers are murderers . They are just doing what they are good at ... some even work for goverments ... Most hackers are people that created many great things in this world ....

This will be my definition for me. Thanks for finding the words, yo. Originally Posted by Orochisudo Here is another question I'd like to ask and read replies to.

By modifying the PS3, or any console I believe, you're breaking the ToS. If Sony had figured out you messed with the console like that, they could potentially ban you from their services. There isn't really as much, uhm, "problem" with doing this. Sony has the power to rightfully ban you, and that's fine by me. Originally Posted by J4sm1n4 I don't understand some of you ... you talk like Hackers are murderers . They are just doing what they are good at ... some even work for goverments ... Most hackers are people that created many great things in this world .... Hackers and hacking is not a subject of black and white, like most things. Yes, there are some "good" hackers and there are some "bad" but it's an act that really shouldn't be needed. They are doing what they're good at, sure. And I hate to be that guy, but just because you're good at something doesn't mean you should be doing it. Let's take a historical figure. The obvious ones would be, say, Hitler, Genghis Khan, Hannibal, those were all guys who were pretty good at killing people. Killing people in unethical, disturbed, and twisted ways. They were good at what they did. Should they have done it? No. Of course not. Hackers, who put time and effort into harming and messing with information that is not theirs, harming other's computers/programs, are good at what they do. Should they be doing it? I don't think so. But, there's a lot of people who think it's needed and will bring up good points. In which I would agree, that it SHOULD be done. Example: But when very crucial truth is hidden from the public which could benefit from such information and is hidden behind piles and piles of software/hardware to prevent it from leaking, then I agree that the hacking is justified. I whole-heartily agree with Lenin The Great here. When it benefits the people, it should be done. When it harms many, or even one innocent individual, it's completely wrong. It's not hard. I still don't think it should be glorified. I still think it's really stupid. 
 When I finally got it figured out, I've changed the whole damn plan. "Memorize this! Memorize Jeremiah Gottwald! Commit it to memory, because that's the memorable name of the man who has defeated you."

You can't really be comparing hackers to Hitler, Genghis Khan, Hannibal .... They were mass murderers ... Sure hackers hack into whatever and like you say ruin peoples lifes some how , but they don't kill them... most of the time cyber attacks are harmless to peoples health ...

 I think it depends on a lot of factors. A hacker can be someone who will just enter another person's poorly protected computer and mess around with it, or it can be a specialist that only deals with complex encryption. Of course we are excluding the 14 year old wannabe hackers. Either way, some may view it as a crime such as identity thefts, while others may consider it helpful e.g. government hackers may find some information that can prevent the start of a war, or at least give them the upper hand. In this situation it depends on what end you're on - the hacker, or the hacked. Saying that "all hackers are bad" is somewhat of a biased opinion.
