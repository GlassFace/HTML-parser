 Fall 2013 Anime List
  Spoiler Log Horizon might be worth a shot for those who like SAO, more Valvrave insanity, more Magi, more Ippo finally, and everyone should check out Studio Trigger's Kill la Kill. The new KyoAni show looks like it might actually be something other than a K-on clone, Kyousogiga has been hyped up forever, and a new Gainax robot show is probably worth at least an episode or three. Looks to be a promising season! 

 didnt really see much...nothing for me

 Yea I'm ready for magi season 2, and. Kuronos no basket 

 There is a lot on there i will make sure to watch. I have been anxiously waiting for IS: Infinite Stratos 2 (it has an ova as well :O) Outbreak comedy caught my eye (maid ^w^) and it sounds interesting. I will watch log horizon but i hope it is not an SAO rip off. Ore no nounai sentakushi ga, gakuen love comedy *inhale* wo zenryoku de jama shiteiru looks good, as did Kill me baby and the Yahari ore no seishun love come wa machigatteiru OVA. I see the next kiss x sis will be available, well... Thanks Ian you have given me a lot to look out for! Where you find this list?

Yeah, it's from neregate.com which you can see up in the top right corner of the graphic. The people who make those will usually put a source on the pic at the top or bottom somewhere! 

 Looking forward to Kuroko no basuke.

 Yeah Kuroko is pretty entertaining, though I fell behind on the manga. Yowamushi Pedal is also really good for a sports manga, so I expect the anime will be worth checking out! 

 I'll definitely be watching Ippo. Is that a listing for a Chihayafuru OVA or just a DVD of the series? 

 I can't wait until season 2 of Magi and Kuruko No Basket come out!!! I hope they are good.

 Finally a Madoka Magica movie that isn't a recap of the anime.

 I'll pretty much be giving most of them a shot but the two I'm looking forward to is Magi second season & the Second Season of Kuroko No Basket. Actually more then just two, got Kill la kill & Blazblue & few others (: 

 Pupa and BlazBlue seem like the best. I'll give Log Horizon a shot but honestly I'm so sick of all these anime where people get stuck in a video game. Also, I'm super stoked for the Chu-2 movie. 
 I was disappointed that Area no Kishi didn't get picked up for a 2nd Season. Was looking at the list and decided to give Kokoro no Basuke a go and it was surprisingly good and a step up from what Area no Kishi tried to do. Definitely looking forward to a 2nd Season of that.

 A very promising season. IS2, KuroBas 2, valvrave 2 and little busters refrain :3 The new shows are also promising. Golden time, strike the blood, kill la kill, tokyo ravens, blazblue, galilei donna, and walkure romanze (that's a lot) might worth a shot. And finally a new gundam series that's not AGE, and also chuunibyou the movie! It's gonna be hard to keep up with this season.

 Not much for me though Gailei Donna seems interesting, well worth a shot.

 So excited for season 2 of Infinite Stratos!

 super excited for more valverave!!!!! and log cabin sounds EXACTLY like SAO. is that legal? lol

 Ippo definitely, I will most likely watch the Persona 3 movie, and this looks awesome 

 Everyone should check out the new pokemon anime: 

 Holy sh*t more Kara no Kyoukai? Is it me or did that come out of nowhere? It's been six years I think... Also more GiTS Arise, YUSSS. Coppelion is definitely one to watch, and other than that, I see a bunch of ecchi garbage, Code Gundam W33D, and Ippo. GREAT SEASON GUYS TOTALLY STOKED.

 I wanna see. IS,Freezing:Vibration,Coppelion,White Album 2 and several more this list is great. So is the winter one. I am real excited for this months choices. 

 Definitely been looking forward to Kuroko's basketball and new Magi. I'm not sure what else I'm going to pick up. Since Kill la Kill seems to be what people are raving about right now, maybe. It just sounds too reminiscent of stuff like samurai girl, real bout highschool for me to want to take it seriously.

I'd agree if it wasn't essentially TTGL but even more over the top.
