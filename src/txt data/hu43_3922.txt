 ABC News does piece on video games, lulz are had
 Buddy clearly didn't read your post, But frankly I'm not Buddy and you specifically chose to engage me directly: Anyway....Anyone see the latest episode of Law & Order: SVU as of today (2/13) on hulu. It was basically Anita's story and Zoe's story mixed together and then taken to the extreme. Kind of interesting. Yeah, I kind of did read her post. She compared the woman in L&O SVU getting raped and beaten to Anita/Zoe having mean things said to them online. That's what I was responding to. Thanks.
