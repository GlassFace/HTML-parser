[Adventure] Pokemon Origins
 i dont know why i watched the first episode but im glad i did. it was pretty good. it is way better than the original show where team rocket would fly in, sing a song, and get easily beaten. reds stupidity was a little annoying but i suspect that will end in the next episode.
