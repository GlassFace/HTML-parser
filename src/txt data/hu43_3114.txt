[Personal Life Discussions] Need Some Help With a Topic for a Speech (Business)
 There is this business club in my school that I am a part of. I chose to do a prepared speech because I am currently in a speech class at the moment. Yet, I have a large issue with part of this speech. I don't have a topic. I actually need help choosing a topic for a prepared speech and I have no idea where I should start. This is because they were so vague on what I can use as a topic that it doesn't really give me a guideline on what would possibly be a good topic. The topic can be anything that is related to business OR entrepreneurship. I have been given a couple ideas but I would like more of a variety to research on. This way I will know what will be the most interesting to the judges and I can get the most information off of for a speech that is at least 5 minutes but will no longer be more than 7 minutes. Please list me some more ideas to think of, it would be very helpful and beneficial to me as well as my brain.
