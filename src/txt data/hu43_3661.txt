[General Discussion] What's happened to the forum ?
 Been away from the forum for the past like 6+ months...and it looks pretty dead. So can someone tell me what's the deal around here?

 It is the winter holidays. People are busy?

 Well you being away for 6+ months never really helped the situation, so why judge?

Well you just found away to make me feel bad man. :/ And I left for so long cuz the forum was kinda going dead to me but then...I had a throwback and remembered I used to come here a lot so came back thinking maybe it changed or something. Originally Posted by Sakiya Rumei It is the winter holidays. People are busy? Winter holidays? Busy? Isn't it more likely for people to be after or before the holidays...and the winter holidays are coming to an end so...doesn't add up.

 I kinda like it this way. Yeah sure there could be a few more members to spice things up.. But I hate crowded forums.

 Most forums get new messages and threads almost every day. It may have been more crowded, we certainly cannot say it's dead. 
Pleased to meet you. My little & very humble anime list: ScarletBeanie. 
 Well new members have been joining quite a bit recently. I've seen at least 5 new people who contribute quite a bit. On top of that admins and whatnot are still here and helping everyone out. It's kinda nice because were just a happy little community who will continue to grow.

Well I hope so...cuz the first time I joined was like a good 3 years ago...and it was much more vibrant with threads, and huge amount of replies.

 We were just bought in some shady smoke filled back room, passed around from owner to owner, like some drunk sorority girl, so maybe that has something to do with it.

My god that's dark. @Archangel Is that Moon Knight for your signature?! Awesome, if it is. @OP Moderate amount of activity. It seems like people have lives now and can't devote much of their time to forums like they did when they were younger, I'm guessing. 
 Anyway, welcome back and don't leave us for months again

I wasn't trying to be rude, but by my last post, the point I was trying to make was that just like you left the forums for whatever reasons you did, other users on this site also have their reasons for not being constantly active as they once were. @Shmuser Name: I honestly don't know who he is, but I just thought he looked cool.

 I feel the forum's slowly dying but that's just me, we get newbies everyday but do they stay?

 It was dead 6 months ago. Nothing's changed. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

 I kind of like it, I'd hate to visit tomorrow and find a topic of mine pushed to page 2 because of constant activity, I'm also not a "go big or go home" type, a nice slow and steady flux of forum conversation is alright by me... till somebody says I'm a ******* idiot for what I've just written and then I'll vanish too for a few days till my nerves are settled, and I can return to the public.
