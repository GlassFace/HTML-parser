 Japan outraged at ISIS Beheading of Hostage.
 I'd blame the world telling the Syrian rebels to **** themselves when they desperately needed help rather than a military campaign against extremism. Does a military response help drive up recruitment to these things? Yeah, just look at how Isreal drives the Palestinians to conflict by disproportionate use of force among civilian populations. Really though Al-Qaeda was pretty much finished, so much so that we saw several leadership splits with Mama-queda. The more they're associated with attacks on civilians throughout the Middle-East the more they push sympathetic populations away. If you look into recent events in Syria you'll find that the original phase of the conflict was fought by a coalition of fairly secular units. There used to be journalists embedded in Rebel units, with many of the rebels dying to get these people to safety on the hope that their story might gain the sympathy of the rest of the world. Iran and Russia stepped in, and the US came down with a case of cold feet, leaving the rebels to a meat-grinder. Naturally they turned to the people with money, weapons, and manpower in the region. This bolstered the status of the extremists real quick as they could claim they were fighting to help their fellow muslims. Gradually it no longer became a choice, you either joined up with the Big-Baghdadi gang, or you were permanently on its shitlist. It was really only a matter of time before the forces were radicalized without outside intervention, now it's rare but there are still a few secular forces fighting both ISIS and Assad's regime. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them.
