 Shadow Fox's Hot Sauce
 Ingredients: 10 Habanero Peppers3 Serano Peppers2 Jalapeno Peppers1 Red Onion1 Avocado - Bascally just for a bit of flavor. You can add more for a greener sauce if you want.1 Tomato of large size1 Lime6 Cloves Garlic2 Carrots8 TBS White Vinegar1 tsp Chives2 tsp Basil1 tsp White Pepper1-2 Teaspoons Sea Salt1 Tsp Olive Oilabout 1/4 - 1/2 cup of Water First you will need to drop a little bit of olive oil in a pan and cut your peppers in half. You will need to fry them for just a little bit. Not to actually cook but just sear the outsides just a little bit for about 2-3 minutes.After you are done, make sure to get everything, seeds and all into the blender from the pan and add all of the listed ingredients above into your blender. Start with the onion and carrots and all the hard stuff first. I did it a little differently the first time I made this and discovered that the top ingredients would not go to the bottom and mix. So If this happens do not worry. Just try to mix it up with a spoon. Add your water to loosen up the chunks and bulk a little bit so that it gets nice and mixed. A lot of mixing will be required. It will end up looking sorta like a milk shake when its done but with a more liquid like something to it when it moves around. I made this today and it turned out pretty good.
