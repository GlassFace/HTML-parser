 Recommend some good pirate/sailing movies please - not comedies
 I love assassins creed black flag and just started watching master and commander. Its very good so far, first 15 minutes that is. What are other good non comedy pirate era movies?? I'm not opposed to older ones but I'd love modern cg enhanced ones. By the way I got the movie on vudu from one of those sign up offers. And I am tempted by that black sails TV show. Please don't suggest pirates of the carribean. Im not looking for a comedy. Though I own the pirates claymation movie which I do like a lot. Thanks. Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk
