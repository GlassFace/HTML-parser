My point was more: We had a team Gold II, we were messing around in gold II for awhile gaining/losing 10 LP a game and then we needed to add some new members but the team was full so we were like **** it we'll try them out on a new team so we don't lose LP. So we form a new team win 4/5 and get Gold I... and it was like *lightbulb* we just did in 5 games what physically would have taken 10 games wins minimum through LP on our other team. So especially with division V-III teams why bother with anything but a reform? The thing is is everybody is doing this and placements are purely MMR or average MMR based after resets, so you can be Division II Silver/Gold/Plat getting murderfested by a Diamond team trying out a new teammate in placements. And you will lose your average 10-20 LP/Promo series for that game. And the opposite happens a bunch too, I have absolutely ****ed a team out of Bronze promos and then after our series we're Plat and its' like "lol why did they play us?". The system is just ****ing crazy with it being A.) too easy to reset MMR and B.) too hard to boost your team once you're placed in a Division. The leagues at least for ranked teams gives massive incentives for not grinding and just deleting > resetting MMR > reforming.

 Anyone think Gambit will lose relegations at the end of this season? I think it is a distinct possibility with how poorly they seem to play all around as of late. 

 Preview of the montage that will be on the first page of reddit.

 This game is getting really boring now. You play against the same five champions every game. Given the size of the champion pool, it's a testament to the awful balance the game has had as of late. 
We are just 'one' within the 'all.' But only when those 'ones' gather together can 'all' exist. - Edward Elric. 
 Ixi, let's play Ahri till we die. Its really annoying in the bottom lane. At least in top lane there are 20+ champions who could probably play there, but in bot lane its a few adcs and just a couple of decent supports 

 I kinda like Braum. I just wished that when I play him support, I could get some ADCs that truly understand how is passive works. I land q on enemy adc, go in for AA. My adc sits there and continues farming. I die. My ADC - "Why didn't you stun them?" Me - ....... Maybe I could if you would help me apply the stacks of Concussive blows you f***in moron. I wont give up though. Ill find a competent ADC one of these games. -_-

And the system for old teams didnt get reset properly but Riot cant do anything about it now (Im challenger in 3s so I personally dont like it since it kinda devalues rank but yea) 
 Awesome Dyrus video lol 

 This is it, the greatest video game mod ever 

 Saw the link just never bothered to click on it. Now I wish I had seen this earlier. 

 i got to diamond 4 this season my 2nd season playing ranked, and for some reason i just quit playing. 

 About to watch the EU LCS again. Some more low kill high farm games probably incoming, *Crosses finger for some type of new champion being picked today*.......*Cries wishing there was more OGN games*...
