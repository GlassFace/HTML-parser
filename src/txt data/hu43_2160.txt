 Hello AnimeFan. Your introduction is kinda unusual. Nonetheless, welcome to anime-forums. I'm not sure how fast it is to get replies here. It will probably depend on how many people are currently online. 

 Welcome to A4, like the person above this post said it depends on how many people are currently online well anyways enjoy it here and that is a weird question

 Hey there. Replies? It depends. Well, we have different time zones after all. Welcome to A4! Enjoy

 Welcome to A4. No, timezone doesn't matter IMO. The topic you're making is the main point. The more interesting it is, the more replies you'll get.

 I never judge a site based on replies in an intro thread. Most forums generate that many new members that sometimes things get missed. Just have a look around, post a few comments, and enjoy the place. Shouldn't take too long. But also... welcome.
