[General Discussion] Shockers 2013 [ Year end review]
 That one event in the calender year of 2013 that shocked you the most. It might be a particular piece of news, an event or even a personal experience(if you are willing to share). ************************************************** ************************ For me, the most shocking event was the Chelyabinsk meteor hit in Russia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelyabinsk_meteor Really scary incident. Where was the anti-aircraft warfare set-up?

 Biggest shocker of 2013 for me was definitely the Boston Marathon Bombings.

 I would have to go with mixed martial arts fighter Anderson Silva destroying his leg last Saturday at UFC 168. It was quite a shocking(and gruesome) way for a fight to end.

 There were quite a number of newsworthy shocking moments this last year. Here are the ones I remember. -The Boston Marathon Bombing -Edward Snowden leaking info and being labeled a traitor by the US government -The US government shutting down (and then the two parties blaming each other and acting like children) -The near constant school shootings or shootings in general -The Syrian crisis (which resolved itself a little too well) -The meteor in Russia -ANY news out of North Korea

 I know some people may call me immature for saying this one....But I'll say it anyway! When Miley Cyrus completely changed into a psycho and it made me sad for all the times I watched Hannah Montana when I was in 4th grade or so. But the VMA performance pretty much shocked me the most.

 Lesse...... + NSA being exposed as cunts and Shadow Fox tinfoil hats becoming obsolete. + Syrian civil war enters another year. Not many people give a crap and even less know whats going on apart from 'they're always killing each other over there.' + Arab spring achieving precisely **** and all for Egypt. Libya seems to be at a crossroads and Tunisia appears to be the only country to move in a positive direction. + A4 staff getting rid of one of the admins via internal forum politics and very public falling out. One could say they pulled off a ....kou. + Feminism taking a sledgehammer to every nerds manchild nerve. OMG SARKEESIAN STOP HURTINGS MY FEELZ AND MAKING ME FEEL GUILTY ABOUT STARING AT BOUNCING, PIXELATED BEWBS. + No more Breaking Bad. Think that's everything. Was gonna mention the fake outrage regarding Miley, but she not only has a small amount of talent, but also a small ass.

Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 A little bit of a tie between a few of them 1. Julian Assange being detained by Swedish government for some bogus sex crime he could not had possibly committed. Just a few female FBI agents or random girls connected to another agency payed off by the united states government in some long ass conspiracy to drag him out of asylum. Because regardless of what international laws you violate or domestic laws or whatever. The instant you leave asylum for any reason what so ever. The united states or any other country that wants your extradition can do so much easier.....and WHO is one of the united states most wanted heroes? ....yeah...thought so. 2. The NSA Scandal - Yeah, Kinda hard to miss information leaking about "conspiracies" that I would had laughed at ten years ago for believing in showings its ugly head out to the world. Revealing that its true. I mean we ALL know about the government scanning our phone calls etc and stuff but....damn....the scope of what they actually had been doing is just unforgivable. 3. Syrian War Crysis - I still try to collect the home made videos from the people from there as Historical proof of what is going on there. Some of them are pretty grizzly. 4. Government shut down - Also a big thing to note this year. 5. ME realizing my Tinfoil hat has not been working....Need more foil. Maybe that will work?

 Pretty much everything Pope Francis has said and done. Wars and terrible crimes are par for the course. Progression coming from the Vatican is legitimately surprising. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 -For me, definitely the verdict of the Trayvon Martin Case. -The Boston Marathon Bombing And sigh, so many more. 

 That the administration built on the idea of "change," that promised greater protection for whistleblowers would label Edward Snowden a traitor, disregard the whitehouse petition to give him a full pardon despite having the requisite number of signers for a presidential response, and actively carry out the character assassination of arguably one of the greatest Americans in history. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them.
