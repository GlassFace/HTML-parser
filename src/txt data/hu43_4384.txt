[Anime] Stuff non anime watchers find weird even though its now just second nature to us.
 apparently a lot of animes i watch have a lot of "screaming at the top of their lungs" scenes. I always get hyped with them whether it is a fighting scene, crying scene, etc, but my friends think there's too much screaming in anime (voice acting i guess?)
