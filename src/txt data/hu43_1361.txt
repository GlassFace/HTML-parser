 My Bride is a Mermaid
 If I have to decide on the cutest, tiniest fiesty anime character, it has to be Maki, but she is mean too, Sun is very sweet, and Lunar is a lunatic, and a pop idol as well. Then there is Chimp, who's basically a human, chimp? What a freak. Sun's dad, he's basically a crazy prick, I don't like him. The style of this anime is similiar to Kodacha, because of the absurd craziness, and it is a little hard to follow at times due to all the screaming and such. Skip Beat is a little like that as well, but Mermaid reminds me of Kodacha more, with the uncontrolable chaos at times. Mermaid would be better if they had toned it down a little bit, and some of the stories, like when Nagasumi grew into a giant and ended up on the moon, were plain ridiculous. Otherwise, I do like watching this crazy anime though. Similiar anime, Mermaid Melody, well not really, but the do have singing mermaids in both series!
