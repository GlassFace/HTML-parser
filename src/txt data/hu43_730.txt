[Fantasy] Date A live
 Thirty years ago a strange phenomena called a "spacequake" devastated the center of Eurasia, claiming the lives of at least 150 million people. Since then, smaller spacequakes plague the world on a irregular basis. Shidō Itsuka, a seemingly ordinary high schooler comes across a mysterious girl at the ground zero of a spacequake and learns from his sister Kotori she is one of the "Spirits" who are the real cause of the spacequakes that occur when they manifest themselves in the world. He also learns that Kotori is the captain of the airship Ratatoskr and recruits him to make use of his mysterious ability to seal the Spirits' powers and stop them from being a threat to mankind. However, there is a catch: to seal a Spirit, he must make her fall in love with him. Summary by Wikipedia Feels like KamiNomi with a fantasical and action twist, based on the summary and the PV. I've tried to read the Light Novel for a bit, and it turned out to be quite good. I hope the anime will be able to be as good as the light novel. Personally my most awaited series of this season. The PV: 
 Life is a process--just one thing after another. When you lose it, just start again. ~OSU! Profile~ 
 Could be good or bad...I have a feeling it will be bad...gonna have to see once it premiers.

 Heh i think they will miss the point in this anime , because he has to date the girl so she doesnt destroy it , but my inner voice say me they will focus more on fights.

Actually, not really.  Spoiler The team where Shidou belongs choose a more safer way to handle the spirits, which is by dating them. On the other hand, another team called AST (Anti-Spirit Team) utilizes the more brutal way to handle the spirits, which is by destroying them. So there are two different forces that handled the spirits. The fights will be mostly between the AST and the spirits, and not with the team where Shidou is in. So the one that do the dating thing and the one that do the fighting thing is not the same person. If you put that into account, then the story will make sense.

 Well I sat through the first episode and my verdict is it's a s*ittyer version of the world god only knows with little to no solid plot and ecchi. Gotta say I'm passing this one. The so called 'fight scene' wasn't all that good either.

 I'm personally really stoked as this anime looks ****ing awesome. Also it's only 12 episodes so I don't think it's worth dropping, even if you don't like it. 
 Has anyone seen the subbed version of this yet? On the websites I visit they only have the raw version, so if any of you could link me to the subbed I'd appreciate it .

 Just watched the first episode, and so far just like what I expected. Not expecting a masterpiece here (especially the storyline since I found some inconsistencies in the plot when I read the LN further), but the character design is just god-tier IMO, which made me excited for this show. Tohka and Kotori are cute, that's the end of it. And more are coming.

 Was going to try to go yoda on this but I can't. Anyway great animation doesn't make an anime watchable. I agree the animation is great and the characters are cute. I'm just a person that watches more for stories now then I was in the past when I went straight for the ecchi and girls. If I was my old self I'd watch this but not anymore. Well enjoy the story...well the animation.

 ^ looks like your old self got transfered into me Anyway, if that's what you think about this show, then I won't force my opinion to you. It all comes down to personal preferences, after all.

 I just laughed on his sister 2 personalities kind of funny, so he will start to date the girls to save the world. I think that is new in anime world 
 
 I didn't think the first episode was bad at all, It was kind of a different experience for me in terms of anime but I do think this series has potential. Although I didn't like the fact that there forcing him to try to make her fall in love with him, I think that's kind of messed up even though that might lead to him choosing her by the end of this series. 
 This one looks good enough. ^^ 
 If you ever fall in love with another girl.. I wouldn't be able to live on!

Well, that's pretty much what runs the entire thing, though. He have to make all the spirits fall for him. As messed up as it is, that's the main point of this anime, so...yeah. There's something bugging me, though. What will he do if one of the spirits is a GUY?

He'll have to take one for the team i'm guessing? 
 So far, it's pretty straight forward. Seems like a less funny version of THe World God Only Knows.

 The second episode is out. Glad that they reduced the info-dumping to minimal. And now the spirit have a name, an appropriate one at that. And yay for more screen time for Tohka

 It seems pretty good so far. Nothing too excellent but it's pretty decent. 

 I already dropped the anime, if the first episode doesn't grab my attention, it's gone. I go for story now a days as well.

 Pretty sure I remember reading a bit of this manga. Don't remember it being anything particularly extraordinary, but I enjoyed it.

 Well if the story dont improve im also thinking about droping it , nothing special at all . The humour ... eh nothing special and they speak a lot instead of some action or romance.
