 Dreamweaver
 So I am a freshman at a high school known as Winward, its a high school founded and funded by the Bill Gates foundation. Anyway I take a web design class and it's pretty cool. We use a lot of dreamweaver and I want to know if it is a good program that is used by many, or should I stick to the basic notepad?
