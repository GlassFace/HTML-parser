How mature is it to assume everyone here's a mind reader? Sorry but while my ovaries do double as crystal balls, they don't give me the ability to read minds. Despite all the immaturity running rampant in the thread probably some of the best advice to come of it as this: Originally Posted by BuddyLee Not liking the way things are is a good thing. Not doing anything about it isn't. That aside, Originally Posted by Zer0 Some peoples perceptions don't exactly correlate with how reality works. But how we perceive things doesn't really effect how they really are I've always thought that in part, perception fueled us to shape the world into what it is. If we're always reacting or acting on our perceptions then we are always creating situations to change the world we're perceiving. Like the person who decided walking wasn't an option and decided to ride a horse.

 Yeah, let's not do misleading thread titles then since suicide is a banned topic on this forum. I get that it wasn't the intention of your OP, but the title was intentionally misleading and lead to some mean replies. If you depair about the state of the world, get out there and do something about it. No one person can change the world on their own, but they can make a positive difference to countless lives by doing some volunteer work or something. If you're depressed in general, it is much better to go and talk to someone about it like your GP or school councellor than ask for advice from immature gets on an anime forum. Just saying.

Maybe people shouldn't be so quick to assume all the time, would it kill anyone to actually take a minute out of their lives to simply asks what he exactly means in his OP without bombarding him with immature statements?

Going by the responses no. It appears that with the exception the few people he entered, didn't bother to read the op, or anyone else's responses for that matter, and posted something about wishing him the best of luck with his depression... everyone read it.

 We moved past the points about thinking this was a topic about suicide two pages ago. I'm not sure what Takeshi even meant. I personally responded to the OP's misconception that evolution is somehow equivalent to "survival of the strongest." It's not a correct belief.

 Again suicide was not in the title and the op denied suicide was ever his intention. Why people insist on jumping the gun instead of using just a bit of common sense i will never know. Now i thought the op's postings were one sided and depressive but suicide never crossed my mind as his intent.

 Again, probably no one thinks that was the intent of this thread.

 Yea I don't think anyone took suicide as the actual intent of the thread once read The issue being "I can't wait to die" is a phrase with extremely strong connotations to suicide. Just because the actual content of the thread wasnt of such, it doesn't negate the meaning of that statement or the fact that is was an irresponsible and in poor taste title... A shock statement garnered for attention. The immaturity of the title was definitely a reflection of the content to follow... There was a whole lot of fail right from the beginning.

 Maybe OP was choking?

Never mentioned anyone not reading it, all I'm saying is the people with negative comments should stop assuming. 
 Agreed dispite what the title of the thread was to not read the original post and come blazing in half cocked was a stupid move and showed a lack of common sense.

 First off, OP: study this picture for a couple seconds.  Spoiler This picture can be perceived in many ways, but the message that I (opinion alert) personally see is this; when you take the time to really learn about the world, you're faced with many gruesome realities. You may think that the middle picture that overlooks a dystopian future is the top of the ladder, but that isn't true. Learning about the dysfunctions of the world is only a small percentage in the pursuit of knowledge. Don't misunderstand, the very top of the pillar doesn't necessarily mean you've gone back to the bottom, where ignorance makes you feel safe. You can never take back what you know, but you CAN utilize what you know into a better understanding of the world and become a better person; advocating what you truly believe in. The top represents awareness of the ugly, the new attained knowledge of what can be done, what is known, the good and the bad, and what simply IS. It is knowing why things are the way they are, even if they are unjust, while also having the knowledge and drive to accept what you can't change and what you can, if you so choose to make a difference in some way in the world. Don't limit yourself by simply hyper focusing on the negativities of the world, as that can leave you satisfied in not acting, like you pretty much admitted here: Originally Posted by Zenex as for trying to change it...its hopeless because the bad far outweighs the good and 90 percent of people think just as you do..oh we have no control over it and i was lucky enough to have one of the decent lives so its no my problem so why care. charities and all that crap have been around for years and they change nothing. They are no more then a public distraction for those who want to do something but do not because it is easier to just say oh i gave a few hundred bucks to the charity im a good person now. You mentioned that a lot of people around you are complacent but that doesn't mean you have to be, OP. Not to insult you, but that is one of the largest problems with people who are bitter. They feel like just because everyone else isn't doing anything that they don't have to exercise any responsibilities themselves; and that doesn't accomplish anything positive at all. Do you truly think you would be one of the rare few people in the world if you chose to act? No, you wouldn't. That is because there are many strong, ideal focused people in this world that decided to NOT be complacent with what was happening around them. You can be that way too. I mean honestly, how will you grow as a person if you don't branch out from what you're comfortable with and try to achieve your own personal accomplishments? OP, you seem to have some very strong core ideals, some that I don't necessarily agree with. Even so, keep learning about the world around you; then ask the questions of what you can do to help, or simply what things you can do ethically to be a better person. You have influence, we all do! Now the question of what you want to do is up to you- you don't necessarily have to march straight up to DC to rally for x cause to be someone who cares about sensitive issues. Simply learn about them, form your opinion, share your opinion, don't tolerate the marginalization of others and KEEP. LEARNING. In fact, don't just keep what you already know- question what you know, revise your opinions (think critically,) etc. If you want to do any type of charity, that helps too! Please don't diss charities by the way, as there are many causes that do truly help people. Choosing the right charity really only comes down to researching which charities are and aren't credible. If you aren't comfortable with choosing big companies like Red Cross or what not, there are many small charities out there that are more direct and personal; that help many people. There are specific donations for specific people with x ailments/unfortunate life situations you can help donate towards as well! I used to donate to a small handful of causes and it was always worth it to me. Community Service is a good start too (I'm going to be doing some of that soon as part of my school duties.) Also, like Buddy said, see about certain qualifications. Take a couple Humanities related classes if you're in College (sociology, religion, ethics, women's studies, history, etc.) Lastly, OP. You mentioned that you feel like the bad outweighs the good and therefore there is no use. I know I mentioned a few paragraphs up that you need to get over your complacency, but I also think you simply need to tweak your mindset a bit here. None of us can save the world, quit thinking of human progress and peace as a super heroes mission. All it really involves is educating yourself and not being a shitty person. Not only can you positively effect the lives of many people around you (as meeting people is a constant) but if you form good ideas, they can inspire and influence others, which can create positive progress and awareness. Sorry this post basically turned into an essay (funny because I have to start a paper that's only a few hundred words longer than this tonight.) This stuff is just weirdly important to me I guess. :B TLDR; betch read my post.

 @Quulix This is probably one of the best posts I've read on A4, as it had interestingly shown me a new perspective on ignorance, to understanding the limitations and the limitless in a profound way. Information with merit are nice gems, but from observations and experience, a consideration to take in is that misanthropic views tend to make a person bitter or harmful to themselves, and unable to allow themselves to learn above what they have accepted as immutable truths. They become what they despise, unfortunately. That said, knowledge can be found anywhere, and nonetheless are welcome to the wondering eye. 
 i totally get what our saying and am glad someone finely said it caz its about damn time something needs to be done about it but yes there is no way to fix it being just one person 
 You need to get outside, because the world is not as bad as you say it is. That pessimistic knowledge of yours is just BS taken from Fox news. You need to be a bit more optimistic. I agree with Quulix, keep learning and you'll see that the world isn't as bad as you make out to be but instead gets better and better. 
 So many books, so little time.
 I've been looking into this tread for a while and it just bugs me. My first impression when someone rants like that is that the person just did not bother to look for anything good in the world. I use this reason for everything. It's just the bad things are so much more entertaining to read/watch then good things. And that is the same when reporting them. So when all you see is bad things on the news or YouTube, or where ever you see bad news, you only see less than half of what is really going on. I can only assume that the OP made the tread on a spur of the moment thing upon receiving a lot of bad news, but that is not the case. No one is going to report people doing what they are supposed to be doing. Also, Quulix summed up my opinion about the subject nicely.
