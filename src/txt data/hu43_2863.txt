 Anime with the absolute worst action you've seen?
 I'm not asking about plot, or art, or any of that. Just the raw action. What series have the most predictable, boring action you've seen? Perhaps it just spams the same thing without end, or the action is "Clash swords, talk for 2 minutes, clash, talk for 5 minutes, repeat?" I'm all ears. I want to see just how bad action gets.
