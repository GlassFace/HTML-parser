 Gaff Occasionally Draws. - Page 3
 Haven't actually done much anime-related work of late, but I'm hoping to change that. In what I fear will prove to be part of an ongoing '90s nostalgia binge, I thought I'd have a go at drawing Ryoko from Tenchi Muyo: Â Spoiler I've also got a process video for it on youtube here. Incidentally, if anyone has any questions about digital art software or anything, please fire away. I've been doing this for long enough now that I might actually know the answers...
