 You can edit the title yourself in Advanced Edit. However, if you wait too long then it won't change on the thread listings so you should get on it quick.

 I got kinda bored of Mushishi near the end of it's first season; but I'm not going to deny that it was a ****ing incredible series none the less. Feeling pumped for this. 
 Normally when you have an incredible series that you start to get bored with by the end (and maybe don't even finish), a new season reboot is just what it needs.

 Sweet baby Jesus is this for real? This is the best anime related news i've heard in a while.

The dreams of those who have fallen, the hopes of those who will follow. Those two sets of dreams weaved together into a double helix drilling a path towards tomorrow. And that's Tengen Toppa! That's Gurren Lagann! My drill is the drill, that creates the heavens!"~ Simon
 Finally, business has arrived.

 Found this hilarious promo:  Spoiler and is there a site where I can catch the show straightaway or do I have to wait for a month or two?

 My God... That episode. I forgot just how much I loved Mushi-shi o___O 
 That classy opening song. I love it how they keep it so slow. The first episode was really fun. Isaza, one of the older characters, popped up. Expecting Adashino and Karibusa to be reintroduced in the same manner. All in all nothing's changed and that's the way I like it. Opening song:  Spoiler

 Episode 4 was really something. Loved that sinister edge to the story.

 Fantastic story-telling. From the pilot to the latest, the pace has always been great and there was always a lesson to be learned or acknowledged. As of this post, the story of the mirror monster is a gentle touch to the hearts of angst-y teens imo. 
 The idea of how the flower maiden was kept alive for generations by giving her head a new body in episode 6, a bit out of place for me, underlined the dark intentions of the episode. Nonetheless it was a good watch. Didn't expect Ginko to set fire to the man's house. He kicked that lantern so lamely. Would have enjoyed seeing Ginko engaged in a fist fight but seeing the gardener was carrying an axe he made the correct decision. Haha, that cheeky bastard. Episode 7 seems to carry a bit of suspense about it, being a special episode. Waiting eagerly for it.

 I believe this show is very accurate in portraying people's shnozzes, unlike other anime. Also, Teru's cute imo. Stop with the ****ing burning white screens, my god my corneas are melting. Being haunted by the rain is...damn, that's unfortunate and a bit scary, also aggravating. I like the cloud simile, a lot of deep and symbolic stuff with Mushishi. 
 Another interesting episode from Mushishi; Episode 8 that is. Can't get enough of it. Adashino has made a comeback. Love his bickering with Ginko. The story concept was also quite smart. I'll leave this here  Spoiler

 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 Bumping this. Anyone have any news regarding the release date of the second half of this season. Everything's gone quiet after the release of that special episode. Those ten episodes were a real beauty.

Plus, I believe the special that aired a month ago counts as episodes 11 and 12.
