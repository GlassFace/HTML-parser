 Saekano: How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend
 I have a feeling that this one's going to be good. I've only watched episode 0, but it's already making a lot of jokes about otaku culture as well as making fun of bad anime writing. Quite an ingenious beginning. It seems to be a harem, but I don't think it will be one of those run of the mill harem anime. Hopefully this is an omen that 2015 anime will be great.
