 Forum Hiding
 There is a feature on vBulletin where you can hide forums. How many of you use this feature, if at all or even know about it? I have a change in mind I want to make and it may affect the ability to hide forums, I wanted to see how many people use this feature and how many people I'll end up affecting if I do make this change.

It often comes as a surprise, filling the heart with sudden Joy. Selfless and giving, Love places the Happiness of another before one's own. It inspires with its Passion, nurtures with its Generosity, and enriches with its Spirit. There is no limit to its magic. Love is Eternal."
