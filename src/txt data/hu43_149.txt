 "What Anime Is This?!" - Ask for help from fellow enthusiasts.
 Hi i'm looking for help finding the name of an anime and sorry in advance what i remember is really limited and what I can remember is as follows: It involves a boy sent to a school that his family doesn't want him in, he's a swordsmen that's normally weak/average but has an ability that allows him to surpass his normal limits for 2 minutes that allows him to be far stronger than most people. He goes to a special school where he is the lowest ranked person and he gets paired up with a female who is the highest rank and she weilds some type of flame power. Ranks may be e and a or d and s can't quite remember. In the first episode she balks at the idea of being paired up with a weakling and the principal/headmaster suggest they duel, he uses his 2 minute limit surpass and beats her. In another episode some kind of tournament is going on and the boy is fighting his old rival who is an archer that has the ability to be invisible up until the moment he shoots, and the boy is depressed and down on himself and getting his a** kicked. He also has a sister that is obsessed with him the usual small, silver haired girl if i remember correctly. I know it's not alot of info but it's all i got, thanks in advance for any effort put in. Oh and this anime is fairly new I watched a few episodes in november or possible december of 2014.
