 Looking for Complex Animes
 Based on the anime listed (assuming you liked all of them) I recommend: Texhnolyze Attack on Titan Mushishi Steins Gate It's a pretty diverse list so you may not neccessarilly like all four but it'll give you a taste of what's out there. If you've watched them come back here and tell me which ones you liked. I'll probably be able to give better and more recs based on that. Also it's funny that when you describe the kind of series you're looking for you don't mention Ergo Proxy despite the fact that it's one of the most complex shows ever. At least in my opinion.
