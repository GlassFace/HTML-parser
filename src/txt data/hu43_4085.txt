 Official Battlefield Thread
 Seems like I have made a few video game threads, but again we don't have one . 1. Does anyone play Battlefield ? 2. I need two more people to join my squad on Battlefield 4 fancy joining ?. 3. Are you getting Battlefield Hardline ? My PSN is Crytek-Echo, add me if you want I play a lot of games but mostly Battlefield, Diablo 3 and COD.
