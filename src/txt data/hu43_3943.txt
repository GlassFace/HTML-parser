[Personal Life Discussions] I keep scratching my arms till I bleed
 Listening to music won't kick the habit. Trust me, I've tried that to relax myself. You really need to go see your doctor. If you don't, and you live with your parents they will probably notice. Your doctor won't criticize you over this or anything. They'll refer you to a dermatologist. This is what is currently going on for me. From there, the dermatologist should be able to make suggestions. If it's psychological, then you likely won't be able to stop on your own. You have to work at combating the issue. Usually it means keeping your hands busy doing something else and away from your skin. A stress ball in the meantime might be useful. But really, a doctor will be able to help a lot more in this case. Cosplay should be put aside for now.
