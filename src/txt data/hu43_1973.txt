 Favorite Vocaloid or song by one
 I just recently got into Japanese Vocaloids, like Hatsune Miku (everyone knows who that is), Gumi, IA... and more that i don't really know. So I was just wondering what is your favorite song by a vocaloid (if you have one) or your favorite vocaloid. Mine is Remote Paranoia by IA... I love it. (*_*)

 I really like Cremation Melody. The original version by Miku is good, but I got hooked to that song after I listened to this amazing girl covering it:  Spoiler 

 I don't listen to Vocaloids as much as I do but when I do take the time to listen to a song, it's always this one.  Spoiler

 I listen to voacloid, but their song variety is simply too big that I even end up with a favorite for each vocaloids, especially IA. She voiced most of the songs from Kagerou Project, and most of them are good, so it's pretty vague. But if I have to pick one, it's probably Lost Time Memory by IA.  Spoiler

 I personally do not tend to listen to songs i do not understand the language as it seems pointless to me when the lyrics are the most important part of a song. the only ones i listen to time to time is the openers of an anime i like because they remind me of the show so i enjoy them. but i do not know japanese or chinese or any og that so im not gonna listen to their music

My avatar is from Lost Time Memory. Shintarou~ Its pretty funny because its Ayano's birthday today. (the girl In the video) You should search up Kagerou project if you are into vocaloid. Here are two more from Kagepro that I really like. ^This one is a non vocaloid but its still really amazing~! thought I'd share Originally Posted by Zenex I personally do not tend to listen to songs i do not understand the language as it seems pointless to me when the lyrics are the most important part of a song. the only ones i listen to time to time is the openers of an anime i like because they remind me of the show so i enjoy them. but i do not know japanese or chinese or any og that so im not gonna listen to their music When I'm in that situation I just pick up some English covers of the songs.

 I've been listening to Matryoshka by Miku and Gumi a lot recently. I guess that for the time being it's this one!  Spoiler Seriously, I've listened to thousands of covers of the song, dubs in many different languages, remixes and instrumentals. I also appear to have subconsciously become attached to Gumi's hoodie. :3 ...This must be why people avoid me.
