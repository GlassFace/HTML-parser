[Anime] School Days = Great!?
 Ok, I just recently finished the notorious anime School Days and....I thought it was great! Maybe because I love it when a character who deserves it gets it (FREAKING MAKOTO MAN!) Â Spoiler He totally deserved to be stabbed and not only did it not stop there, having this crazily obsessed girl Kotonoha kill Sekai was just as satisfying! AM I RIGHT FELLAS! . Anyways after reading reviews, it seems I am one of the few people who actually enjoyed it and made me laugh as the ending was shockingly great. What do you guys think? Am I just crazy ?
