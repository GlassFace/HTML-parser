 GS 1.0 - Anime, Gaming And J-Pop/Rock Band
 Hello there everyone! I'd like to introduce you to a musical project I really think some of you guys will like. I'm in a British band called GS 1.0, and we make music and videos that celebrate the community of anime, gaming, cosplay and Japan in general. Our style is generally Rock/Pop, but we branch out into Electronic, Metal and other genres too. We write our own songs about anime and gaming, as well as covering beloved themes and soundtracks from anime, games and J-Pop artists. We put everything we can into our work, and we really hope that we can bring a bit of the Japan spirit to you guys! We're aiming to appear live at conventions this year, but for now, we're releasing music videos, comedy sketches and more on our Youtube channel. I appreciate that shameless self-promotion can be pretty terrible, but I promise I wouldn't share this with you if I didn't think it was worth something - so I really hope some of you can get some enjoyment out of our band! I'll post here whenever we release something new. For now, here is the official GS 1.0 Youtube page where all our projects are uploaded: https://www.youtube.com/user/gs1point0/videos Enjoy!
