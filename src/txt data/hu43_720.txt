[Personal Life Discussions] Favourite childhood memory?
 Pretty simple; what is your favourite memory from your childhood? For me, it's probably building lego and watching avatar the last airbender and pokemon. 
 A girl once told me that they hurt somewhere too like a guy when we hit our nuts then she grabbed my hand and placed it on her boob. My favorite and most embarrassing child hood memory. 
 
 Damn, so many. Sitting in my living room just in front of the glass door, bathing in the amplified warmth of the morning sun while playing Pokemon yellow. Receiving my first deck of Yu-Gi-Oh cards on a warm Easter morning. I felt like it was so ****ing cool to have Joey's deck and my own Red Eyes. 
 
 Playing Pokemon Blue for the very first time. My dad rented me a video game randomly and thought I would like this game that turned out to be Legand of Zelda:Ocarina of time....that was a magical game. The first time I played a video game. 80% of my childhood consists of video game memories. A few other good ones here and there but otherwise my childhood was ****ed up with constant bullying, being told I was stupid and not good enough to participate in the math and english classes the other kids were taking, having my brain scanned for irregular stuff for my genetic disorder and countless visits to psychiatrists just to have my childhood ADD and Tourette syndrome taken care of with meds. So many other crap. it was a constant embarrisment and being told I wasn't good enough and video game memories make up 80% of my good ones. So they are my most precious memories from my childhood easily.

 So many... When I was 4 years old for christmas I got nintendo 64. And my mum turns around to read the instruction booklet. Shes like, don't touch anything until I read how to do it. Then shes like wdf? I already had the thing set up, all the cables and channel av with the game loading rofl. Was my first console. Then I got gameboy colour the year after before I went to croatia, I was so pimp with my ash katchem hat and pokeball.

 Spending 300 hours on a Pokemon game, having an amazing imagination (dirt/mud + water = sexy as mud cake), watching Pokemon and Naruto and Yu-Gi-Oh, eating breakfast and having nothing to worry about. 
 
 I almost spend my childhood playing my pokemon games,zelda games,watching pokemon,and throwing my toys in the river.....

 My first time on a plane , i just remember flying through some cities and they looked so small , one of the most beautiful memories i have from the chilhood times. 
 
 Going to LA and going to the Discovery Zone there. You remember Discovery Zone? That place that was just one big playground for kids. We used to have one in my city, but it shut down for some reason. So, when me and my family went to LA for business, we saw one there and decided to stop in. So much fun! Spent almost all day there. I also saw a three year old run full speed into the corner of a table and fall to the ground with blood gushing from his head. Luckily, that was right when we were leaving, but what a sight to see before leaving. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
 I enjoyed being with my tutor, Rena and her daughter Jasmine. Rena was like a mother to me since I never grew up with my real mom. Now they disappeared from my life. I guess that's just how life is. 
 There are too many to count. I would have to say though that one of my most favorite memories is waking up on Christmas morning and opening up a Super Nintendo console. My parents did not get to watch TV for the next month, lol. 

 For me? When I defeated my rival in a game of Yu-gi oh duel cards. I was so happy we played another game, then he beat my a$$. Sadly.

 Aaa the days of simplicity... I recall having a deep fascination with fireworks. I would watch them in awe as a child and the memories are one of the most vivid. 
 I have plenty of good childhood memories like: Building tunnels in hay and placeing electric lanterns, sometimes even sleeping up there with the cats and kittens in our blankets. Having picnic in the garden with my sister our pupies and our tamed chickens. Falling a sleeping on our old arabian mares and to get scolded by mom for sleeping on the horses (>.<)' Fishing with dad, building huts in the forest and pretending to live there, scaring my sister's son with spiders, playing GTA with my brother. Jumping from high heights landing in hay with my neightbour. Having rabbit-jumping-competitions with my sis and our rabbits. Playing spies with my best friends- our mission was to steal my moms cakes and other sweats (mission success) (Y) Oh my sweet childhood- How I miss you! D': 
 Too many lol, but one of my youngest ones, was watching Ranma 1/2 (on like a VCR lol) with my overseas cousins when i was 8 years old. It was special because my cousins hardly come to Australia anymore xD

 Watching my first anime. Well not sure if it counts. I had checked out naussica of te valley of the wind movie from my library and well the movie was so nice. It was just so perfect 

 I am both shocked and happy that I am not the only one who had great memories with Pokemon. One of my best memories was getting Pokemon Red @ K-Mart on Sunday, May 16, 1999. That day on, I became a Pokemaniac (despite taking occasional hiatuses for various reasons).

 my first day at school. i was going insane and mom picked me up. then this teacher was trying to 'comfort' me and bring me back inside and instead I kicked her in the face. of course that didnt end well since mom took me home straight then made me kneel down on rice and belted me as I was made to hold books on both hands. and yeah... i never kicked teachers again since then >_> i put gum on peoples hair and hurt some kids but... mom never found out about those .... 
I am cute and i am amazing and fun, how can you hate me? how can you not like me really??? 
 going to Canada's wonderland in grade 7, christmas morning as a child,and birthdays. you know, the usual. 

 playing Hide and seek, we played it that way that the hiding people would need to touch the place where the searcher was counting and say freedom, the searcher also just needed to touch the place and say the names of the hiding people if he/she found them. First one cached was the next searcher. Once i came to a very nasty idea. Me and my friends thought it would be really funny just to go home while playing it. Girl searched for us and wasted her time for hours.
