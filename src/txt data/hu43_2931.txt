As long as we're close and he receives my prayers, I'm good. XD I don't hate any of the other denominations because they have their own ways of running the place, and I have mine. But as I said, it really doesn't matter to me. To me, the closer people get to God, the less denominations matter. If one of your beliefs are at fault, and you're in the presence of God, you'll find out sooner or later.
