 Left Formatting Posts
 I am not sure what is going on, I can only guess some new codes are being written in, but I have notice that instead of using the full page for a post, everything gets squished to the left. Is this a permanent or will it be resolved? I don't think I need to add a screen shot but if I do, just tell me and I can show you. I'm also using chrome but I'm not sure if that has anything to do with everything squishing to the left. This issues isn't with every post but it's happening more often than not and I'd just like to know what's going on. Edited 1: The issue did so on this post XD. Edited 2: And it fixed itself after I re posted the edit.

 I agree its the same for me as Ive posted about in another thread where the youtube video was squished and not all of it was showing so I couldnt fullscreen or change the reso. I had to go to the youtube link to watch it. 

 I'm seeing it quite often myself too. It's inconsistent, but it's jarring. Just one more little annoyance on top of the **** at the top of the page that always loads in slower than anything else, causing everything below it to move slightly around, resulting in misclicks if not sitting around for an extra 10 seconds. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

 A4 just doesn't want to be right.

 obama jokes aren't funny anymore 
 Yeah, it's weird. I'd like to know why it's happening, too. 

 It seems to always happen on the newest post for me, fixing itself as soon as another post is made.
