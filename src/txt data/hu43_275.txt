 Bring back A4 Club's
 Hello, Some of you might know me from the past, and some may wonder who the f I am. But that is another thing. Well.. I was looking around in the Social Group section and I honestly tried to see the good innit, but I never found it. I understand that the mods here on A4 are bored of the old Club section we had, and I understand that. There was A LOT of unnecessary spamming going on at that place, and I was one of the "spammers", I confess that. But if you look at the "Game" section with the "Bla bla bla the User above you" threads, THOSE are the real unnecessary threads, I dunno if you removed them or what not. But it people we're enjoying the good old section. I hardly see any of the old club members from the Naruto and Bleach club, you people made a lot of hardcore visitors of A4 leave and never to return. But I won't start a war here with you Mods or anything, just wanted to share my feeling on this whole new Social Group section. I suppose the newer members will have no problem with them I will poke my head in and out here on A4 for some time, feel free to send me an IM if you wanna talk about things other that this, or more about this // HiTsu PS Originally Posted by Neji195 My Dbz club was Legendary.
