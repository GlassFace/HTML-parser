 Official A4 Broadcast Feedback Thread - First Show!
 You can find the broadcast here. http://www.twitch.tv/shiankiri/b/476437590 Tell us what you thought about our first official broadcast. What did you like? What did you hate? What would you like added or changed? Did we cover enough topics? Too much? We'll use your feedback to try and tune and polish the show for the next one. 

 It was pretty fun! 10/10 got to do what I wanted to do, which was talk about log horizon! looking forward to the next one

 Way too much talk about animu. Who even watches those cartoons anyway? 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 Sounds fun ^^ I might come listen next time :3 
 
 It sounded fun, much like a college radio show. I'd tune in for a lot more of them in the future. One issue, though for me was that I found one voice (Which was Ian's I think) was the only one that I could hear clearly. The other ones had a really low audio.

Ian and KT both sounded fine, though Ian's volume was marginally lower than KT's. Didn't really make a difference, though. Shian was the giant robot shouting in your ear.

 I'm listening to it right now and I'm really noticing the audio issues. Shian was having problems before the broadcast ever started but we ran the thing anyway. That bit where I suddenly disappear towards the beginning is actually the result of my landlord showing up and having to talk to me. Couldn't have come at a worse time! 

 I wish I could have called in during the Naruto talk. Good job, I'm listening to it right now. Hope this continues so I have something to listen to when going to work! If I can find a way to just get the audio. I do like the video idea though.
