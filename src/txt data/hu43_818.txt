[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires - Page 5
 Man episode 21 is too much for me to handle too. Revelations after Revelations, the excitement does not stop since episode 2. I'm heart is racing! Now, I really wonder what happens next.

 Wow, Episode 21 caught me way off guard... I was not prepared, nor was I expecting this...  Spoiler I really hope somehow, or someway that Inuzuka comes back. He was my favorite character:/

 Once again, you can never be too prepared before watching a valvrave episode.  Spoiler I guess, the Karlstein soldiers [A - Drei] might uncover the truth about Dorrosia and the Council of 101 huh? They've had their suspecions especiall H-Neun

 I can't believe this episode of Valvrvae... it ended on a HOPEFUL note, with understanding between all the characters! Not shock and despair, but hope! O_O I'm sure that'll all come crashing down once the next episode starts, lol... xD  Spoiler

Yamada's death was sad. But it would have been a lot sadder though, if they hadn't foreshadowed it so obviously, lol. I think we all saw it coming since the episode started that this was going to be his time to go. Of course, if this was some other anime we might think, "No, they wouldn't kill him off!" But this is Valvrave, so we know better. xD

 great episode, once again **** is going down. L-Elf revealing the truth about the Chancellor of Dorussia, what will the world do? the ARUS president is tied up with the council of 101 as well, are they going to turn on Dorussia and side with the "monsters?" Will Haruto lose all of his memories about Shoko and die? Find out on the next two remaining episodes! Two episodes remaining? it happened so quick, I don't want it to end.

Well, you notice how the Arus president appeared visibly upset about what he was dong. Now that he knows the truth he must feel terrible about it, but at the same time the Council will never have let him in on their secret if they weren't 100% sure of full cooperation, so you know they've got Arus strung up by the toes somehow. I'm sure he's being pressured, and is fighting the turmoil and conflict within himself. So on the surface Arus will have to align with the Council, but there is a chance that they will try to rebel? Or the president might even sacrifice himself to personally fight back. All seem like likely possibilities!

 Seems like Haruto is finally starting to grow a spine. I thought for the longest that he and Kira Yamato was having a 'spineless off- ignore the reality of the world' competition. I just wish they showed more backstory with the various factions and how they all came to power.

I've never thought of that, I always thought of him as a rat. xD If he does anything that will upset the Council, he's ****ing dead or he will turn into one of them . He probably doesn't want that, so he is most likely to cooperate with the council. You are right, so many possibilites and we're watching vvv so expect everything! NO LIMITS. Originally Posted by Ned When it comes to Shinji I turn into a bully. I just can't stop myself from picking on the guy, lol! He is that type of character, that you just want to bash his head in. also Evangelion 1.11 shinji is (not) a pussy, by that I mean he is.

 what a depressing ending. was that really Shoko who was in Haruto's pilot suit? Does that mean she replaced Haruto? what?

 It literally doesn't feel like it's over at all, I felt as if there could have been another season explaining the rest of the content more in depth.  Spoiler The fact that Haruto died was kind of disappointing. Why entertain a love story for a whole two seasons just to kill the main character off? It was definitely a waste of development.

Why entertain a love story for a whole two seasons just to kill the main character off? It was definitely a waste of development. I loved the ending actually  Spoiler the fact that the anime didnt cater to the normal "good guy win and live happily ever after" cliche was refreshing. I do wish the relationship between Haruto and Shoko was finished a little with him choosing her or Saki but his death I feel was needed to solidify the story and act as the catalyst for L-Elf and Shoko to realize the roles they play. What I did not particularly like was the speed at which L-elf and Haruto went from forming a pact to reveal the truth to the world to actually doing it (literally one episode!) while spending 20 episodes on other things. I think that part of the story deserves at least a couple of episodes 
 The ending was perfect! It retained that same sense of tragedy with hope rising out of despair, which we saw throughout the entire series. This is exactly what I loved about the show! Kinda happy to see that I was right about the Arus president.

 The thing that really got me though...  Spoiler The internet. How could they believe that the footage aired on a live stream during a large public announcement was doctored, yet they wouldn't question the footage shown of Rukino that was broadcasted from inside a Dorsian building and could have been taken at literally any time before it was aired, with as much time as they wanted to make any kind of modifications they wanted, plus the subject of the video was bound and immobile, so they could do whatever they wanted to her? Ugh, that pissed me off. :/

 They could have touched on their future selves a bit more instead of only giving us clips throughout both seasons, honestly I felt as if this show could have been as long as Eureka 7 with as much content as they had. It's a shame to see things get so rushed.

 Originally Posted by Fate_ lol, not even close. Still hoping for that though. Exactly! Me too. :3 Unfortunately though... the way they tied off the ending so neatly I highly doubt it. They could do one of those totally new stories and characters in the same setting sequels, but those are rarely done right... (For instance, I really enjoyed Fam the Silverwing after Last Exile but too many of them are more like the horrid Eureka 7: Ao sequel instead I do have high hopes for the Princess and the Pilot prequel though. So far it looks good! But that's movie-to-anime so it's a different case.).
