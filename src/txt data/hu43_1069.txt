 [EVENT] New Site Banners for A4 - Page 3

We have had this discussion before with mods but It never went anywhere. We even had art contests for a mascot but nothing happened with it.

Well thats cool I guess. I remember when I joined this forum, this was 2nd from the top, maybe 3rd. I chose it because it looked the nicest and the forum thread sections seemed better.

 My one and only attempt. 

 Doubt this will make it in but I decided it'll be cool if there was a one having to do with Guilty Crown, not much done here since it was a rush job to meet the deadline.

 Oh no no. Tak, we don't want RIP banners. You may make banners that say things like ^___^ or "cooldeals" or something like that. A subtle salute to her. No one wants to see morbid RIP banners when they log in. They would rather have happy memories.

 This post is breaking Shannon's rule, but I thought I was going to see three pages of awesome banners. Now I'm disappointed.

If you really think that way, then don't submit it before making it better.

 I've submitted the banners to Shian, so closing this up. I will put up a new thread shortly.
