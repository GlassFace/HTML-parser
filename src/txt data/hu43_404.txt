 Who cares about ol' D&D anymore?
 I've only played 4th edition, so that's really the only edition I could say I enjoy at the moment. I've looked into Pathfinder, but haven't played it with anyone. My friends and I are planning to play another 4th edition, this time run by someone else other than myself. Should be fun!
