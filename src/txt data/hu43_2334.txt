[Mecha] Knights of Sidonia
 I ditched the anime for the manga, nbut can't help but watching it. So after the latest ep: All skill Nagate, too pro. I've been shipping Izana and Nagate since day one, and judging from the manga's development of Izana she's going be going through some radical ****. YOU GO BOYGIRL. With artificial, expendable kabis come GUNS NYEGGUH. So after the latest ep: Ruh roh, Benny's back. Why is everything so high risk but high reward in Sidonia?
