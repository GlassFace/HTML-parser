 Courtney Love is planning on suing Activision

Maybe, but I doubt Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic protests against this because they want money for drugs (...since they wouldn't get any money, and probably has enough money to supply themselves with it). Having Cobain as a playable character that can play all songs in the game is similiar to depicting Mother Theresa as a bloodthirsty general in a game about world war 3. It might be funny and it certainly doesn't hurt anyone, but it's also sort of stupid and juvenile to think that people wouldn't take offense by it and feel that the image of someone they are looking up to are being misused. Who knows what Kurt Cobain would have said if he were alive. Maybe he'd be alright with it. But we can't really know. From what he expressed when he was alive, we can make an at least semi-accurate guess that this is not something that he would have liked. Tbh, I think it's pretty stupid that activision would put any dead "guitar hero" in the game. There's a lot of -living- guitar heroes that could be used instead, and then we wouldn't have this problem to begin with. If there's anyone who is money-grubbing here it's activision, they could just have negotiated for someone alive to use in their game instead. The Soundgarden guys comes to mind (if we should stay within the grunge genre), or perhaps Dave Grohl and the foo fighters? He was in nirvana as well, so maybe they could even have gotten a 2 for 1 deal there...
