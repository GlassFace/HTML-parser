 Evangelion remake
 I recently bought the first dvd of the evangelion remake. Having watched the original i was curious with what they did with it. It has been awhile since i have seen the original and may have missed any major changes. what i did noticed was they added some new cg (i really like what they did with ramiel the 5th angel) a new voice actor, (i like dubs over subbed, its just easyer) and maybe a new chat scene. Over all i really liked it and looking forward to more. If i missed something major that I should know that has greatly changed the original from the remake plz let me know so i can investigate further. Ugh i feel stupid now. I started reading up on the remake and found out that the first installment stays with the original but breaks off from there. Since i don't own the second dvd i did not know that. *take foot, insert into mouth.*
