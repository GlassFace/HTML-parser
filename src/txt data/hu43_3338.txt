 Story had me on my toes the whole time. Intense moments+teamwork (MC couldn't do anything without others.) Glad I gave it a chance. I'm sure this will get pretty good reactions if people watched a little bit, especially with "Peter Pan syndrome." 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
