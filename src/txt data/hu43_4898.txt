[General Discussion] Do you build models?, share your work if you do.
 I used to. I just stopped for no apparent reason. It was fun when I did it. Its kind of soothing in a obsessive compulsive way. I made a star destroyer, a kirk (shatner era not pike) enterprise ncc1701, and one or two cars. I still have a few unopened in the box. Someday I may start them up again. So do you build models? What kind? Got pics to share?
