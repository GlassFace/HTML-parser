[Slice of Life] Rolling Girls
 Rolling, falling, scrambling girls. For others. For themselves. Even if they're destined to be a "mob." The Rolling Girls (ローリングガールズ) is an upcoming 2015 Japanese anime television series produced by Wit Studio. Two manga adaptations began serialization in Japan on October 4, 2014. An anime television series produced by Wit Studio was announced by Pony Canyon to begin airing in 2015.[1] The series will premiere in Japan on MBS, Tokyo MX, BS11. Yes... I know this is the most "wtf?" plot description ever. lol! But, it is what it is! *EDIT: We now have a better synopsis! xD Ten years after the Great Tokyo War, each prefecture in Japan has split up into independent nations. Each nation is ruled by a prophet called "Mosa" and an army called "Mob" as they start to compete to take over other countries. Four "Mob" girls from the Saitama clan, Nozomi, Yukina, Ai, and Chiaya, are ordered by their "Mosa" to travel around Japan riding their motorcycles to mediate multiple battles between nations and clans as they emerge.
