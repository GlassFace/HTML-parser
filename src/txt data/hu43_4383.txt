Oh, and fanservice. There's a reason that the uninitiated perceive anime as little more than cartoon porn (usually with tentacles and school girls that are much too young), and things like ecchi being so relatively popular don't help alter that perception. Sometimes you write exactly what I'm thinking. I'll add "weirdly specific comedy tropes" to the mix. Most normal human beings don't know what a nosebleed in anime means.
