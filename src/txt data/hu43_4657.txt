[Anime] Unique or Memorable Anime Characters

What do you believe makes these characters unique? Is it their personality, their appearance, their mannerisms, etc.,? Pretty much the entire cast of Shiki. Their hair styles for one. And a lot of them have seriously annoying personalities. While that might sound bad, honestly it's not it makes them seem more human ya know? Lain from Serial Experiments Lain. She is a very rare unique lead. Soft spoken, keeps to herself, and is just very chilled out all around. Unlike the usual bubbly female lead. Pretty much all the characters in Arakawa Under The Bridge. The main girl I forget her name I can see her face though. Everything about her is unique. Actually the only character in the story that ISN'T would be the main character and he has a way about him that is also different. Ika Musume from the same titled series. While she seems like a character you've seen before she really isn't her child like innocence is really interesting compared to her I will rule the world and take over all humans!, type of persona. Osaka and a few other characters from Azumanga Daioh. She's spacy. It's super, super rare to find a character that seems like they have a serious problem with focusing on something and it's all too adorable. I really love Osaka lol. I could think of more maybe I'll add a few later.
