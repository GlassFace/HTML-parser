[Anime] What animes are these clips from?
 You should give Najica: Blitz Tactics a try (Female anime James Bond). I think you might like Burn Up: Excess as well (Police Girl Anime). I own both series, they are pretty good. Nothing wrong with a little fan service.... Oh, I see Ikki Tousen is recommended, also a good one. (I got it, too - High school fight club).
