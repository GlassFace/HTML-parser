 iPad Help Please!
 I've been having this problem for a while and finally decided to come here for help. My iPad is full of junk data that I just can't seem to get rid if (10 gigs) and I have tried iClean which helped a little but not much, I've deleted most of my apps. So anyone have ideas on what to do?
