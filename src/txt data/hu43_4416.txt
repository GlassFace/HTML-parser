[General Discussion] What does it mean to owe someone a favor?
 I am writing a story. At one point one of the characters goes out of her way to help another character even though he previously just ignored her. He says he owes her a favor. What do you think this means? Also this pic is cool. 

 Repayment of a debt.

 Something people say to be nice but don't actually mean, usually said in lieu of any kind of actual reward.

 Maybe he helps her on a test or something, that works as a favor or maybe she doesn't have money for lunch and he spots her the cash. again a favor. Basically a repayment.
