 What are the best Slice Of Life/Romance?
 I'm having trouble trying to find Slice Of Life/Romance. I don't mind if it takes places inside of a School. What do you suggest for me to check out. The only ones I've seen so far is Honey and Clover. =) Thank you! 
 
 This isnt as much a romance, but K-on is one of the best slice of life animes i've seen. Other than that, maybe....err, haganai (if you are ok with harem/ecchi)

 Dusk maiden of amnesia Mysterious girlfriend x (highly ecchi) Hand maid may (ROM com,) The kawaii complex Monthly girl Simoun ((Yuri) Strawberry panic (Yuri) Junjou romantica (yaoi) Loveless (yaoi) Sakura trick (Yuri) Your lie in April Ao haro spring 5 cm per second Rail wars (harem echhi) If her flag breaks (harem ROM com) Kampfer (Yuri elements, ROM com brawler ecchi)

 Drama/slice of life/romance-Clannad (I've still got this on my to watch list, but it's really popular in the genre you're looking for) comedy/slice of life/romance-Toradora ecchi comedy/slice of life/romance-B gata H kei(also has a good English dub called Yamada's first time and is rather funny) and it's more of adventure/romance than slice of life but I'd recommend spice and wolf 
 Ai yuri aioshi Clannad Boys be

 Say I love you Wolf girl and Black prince Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi (yaoi)
