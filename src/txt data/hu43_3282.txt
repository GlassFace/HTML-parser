 Anybody going to Comic-Con 2015?
 Hey. My mother is bringing me to Comic-Con in San Diego as a high school graduation gift. I've never been to a big con or to California, so it should be exciting. When I first get there, I'm gonna dress like a cowboy and be like "HOWDY Y'ALL!! I'M FROM ARKANSAS!!" And then I'm gonna go back to normal and go in my actual cosplay. Anybody else going? :3 
 White panties sure are cute, lol.
