[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 The story is set in an era when 70% of the human race lives in space due to the development of space cities. Between two major powers—the Dorushia Military Pact Federation and the Atlantic Ring United States (ARUS)—there is a small neutral nation called Jiouru that has prospered economically. The protagonist Haruto, a high school student who lives in Jiouru, encounters the mysterious "forbidden" humanoid weapon Valvrave when the Dorushia army invades. This was an unexpected surprise that popped up today! Very intriguing characters and story. I'm not even a fan of mechas, but this show looks good! Make sure you watch past the ending sequence of the first episode for a nice surprise. I can't say anymore without spoilers, but you won't be disappointed!
