[Anime] need more anime in my collection
 Shadow Skill, Kiba(actually Kiba is very much like Shaman King in so many ways, so much so, It's virtually the same thing, just in a fantasy setting, and with extra elements added to it), and Yu Yu Hakusho are sort of like Shaman King. You want a great drama, slice of life anime, Kemono no souja erin(so great it puts clannad to shame), unfortunately you'll need to pick up a unlicensed Maylasion release sigh, since for some reason the official DvD release, doesn't have a sub option(even though the Japanese themselves subbed the series at day zero, long before the DvD release) Aside from Kemono no souja erin, perhaps check out Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, It's a pretty damn awesome anime. Not really the same thing as Sailor Moon, but perhaps you would like Elemental Gelade, Busou Renken, and Zero no Tsukaima PS. Avoid Pok√©mon like the plague, It's the same 3 things repeated over, and over again for over 700 episodes.

 [IMG][/IMG] It probally wouldn't be a good idea to get on Qiang Lei's bad side.
