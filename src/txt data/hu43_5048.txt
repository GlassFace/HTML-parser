 Forum-ception
 Not only is A4 now a run of the mill eyesore of a site, but it runs like a fat hog due to all the ads, and the facebook, Twitter, etc. **** at the top of the page makes simply clicking on 'latest posts' a ****ing chore since they load in slow as **** and move **** when they do. It's such a hassle to use the full site while on my phone. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
