 can goku defeat a blackhole
 As far as what we know of real black holes, he'd be stretched apart and crushed by one just as literally every other DB character would. As far as fictional black holes of the comic world, it could go either way. The Hulk was able to survive a black hole, for example. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
