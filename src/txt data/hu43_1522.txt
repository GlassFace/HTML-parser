 Best to show them an anime with a mature storyline and little fanservice since this is what turns people off with anime. Try showing them an anime movie. They're like Disney movies pretty much. Like Ghibli films or Summer Wars.

 Im going to suggest elfen lied just cause i want you to post a youtube reaction video. Sorry most 'safe' anime in this case isnt going to help them understand, and theres a high likelyness they simply wont get it period. Go with something moderate from their own likes. There are many good choices out there. 
 Bakuman is non-ecchi and shows a little bit about manga/anime production and Japanese slice-of-life. It might be relatively safe. 

 Well, if I were you, I'd probably show them Death Note (probably to your father) and Angel Beats (specially the ending (probably to your mother))

 My dad is amazingly into Chobits. Like, I showed him some science fiction stuff a while ago, and some Ghibli movies, and next thing I know, he's proselytizing Chobits, like I can't possibly call myself an anime fan if I haven't seen Chobits. I'm like, Dad, I'm just not into that kind of show, and I would never have guessed that you would be. I think my point is, there's just so much out there that can be called "anime" that you can probably find something that your parents might like, rather than finding an anime and expecting them to like it. 
 Ghibli films are probably your best choice, but Makoto Shinkai's work could also be a good option. Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, and Arrietty would be my top three picks for Ghibli stuff and Voices of a Distant Star or [The Place Promised in Our Early Days[/i] for Shinkai stuff. All of these have the advantage of being pretty short since they're movies. If you want to try introducing a parent to something a bit longer, you might try Time of Eve. 

 I would show Clannad, it has common elements in Shounen anime (harem, high school, etc) but it has little ecchi/fanservice and it has a good story.

If you want to show them anime in general, just show them Naruto/danshi koukousei nichijou/darker than black/clannad/kimi ni todoke... that should cover anime in general. << No idea if this sentence makes sence by the time i finished writing it -.-

Let me add "5 centimeters per second" by Shinkai on the list if you want your parents to cry buckets

 Show them one that is closely based off there reality preference. That'll probably work for them. 

 Boku no Pico, that's what anime's about!

Cool story bro. I second this. There are so many kinds of good anime out there, find one that suits your parent's interests. Some good animes a mature person might enjoy from my anime list: Lupin the third, Clannad, Death Note, Fullmetal Alchemist, Ghost in the shell, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Hellsing. 
 Afro Samurai is like the best show to watch with your mom  Spoiler 

 An anime that has a lot of emotion behind it. For example, Ano Hana, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, or Clannad.

 I don't think my parents will ever understand anime so I just gave up trying a long time ago. My father does like anime despite still being confused no matter what he watches and my mother...Yeah she doesn't get it at all. If you want them to understand anime you should explain it yourself in words, it's probably easier than trying to show them something if you ask me. Anime is too varied to have anything used as an example of the medium but Ghibli films are the easiest choice to make. Something like Princess Mononoke or Naussica and the Valley of the Winds would be good choices. 

 I showed my parents Bleach and Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood and they enjoyed it. Probably because they are similar to the type of TV shows that they find interesting.

 Originally Posted by j77k Boku no Pico, that's what anime's about! ROFL!!! But seriously, Time of Eve is a great choice made by Ian, Clannad may work also. You could try some safer ones like the Studio Ghibli stuff, you honestly can't go wrong there. Show Howl's and tell them this was nominated for an academy award to show the relevance of anime in mainstream America....god, I dunno anymore...just rambling now....

 Maybe Usagi Drop, thats what I would show to my parents... 
 My mum has seen all the ghibli movies and liked them. Depends on the person really as my dad really liked akira and my brother liked 5 centimeters per second, but go with ghibli. I would show them a movie though, not a series. If you show them ghibli in english they will think better of it because of VAs like patrick stewart, shia lebeouf, uma therman, timothy dalton, christian bale. A lot of famous western actors, so they will not dismiss it.
