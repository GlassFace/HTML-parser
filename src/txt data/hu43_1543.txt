[General Discussion] A4 Vocaroo Thread
 http://vocaroo.com/ We have a photo-sharing thread so why not a voice-sharing thread? Click that link up there and record something -- anything! -- and share it with the forum. Do whatever you want with your recording. You can read some dialogue for a show you like, sing a song, or just say "Hello!" and nothing more. Have fun with it. - - - - - - - I'll get the ball rolling. This is me singing what basically constitutes my entire musical taste in my teenage years. 10 points to anyone who can name all the songs (without Google). http://vocaroo.com/i/s0Dv6TXubLc3 

 Be warned: my voice is a little bassy. http://vocaroo.com/i/s1YYoPrzTnOk http://vocaroo.com/i/s0cE0FNtrtxc

 Welp.... Here you go.... Some lines from a book.... http://vocaroo.com/i/s1ZZFGQrvcCQ http://vocaroo.com/i/s1sHsI8Meutb Also, you might want to turn the volume up.... I'm rather soft spoken and my mic sucks.... KT  Spoiler I know one of the songs is from a Ska Band and the only two Ska Bands I know are Reel Big Fish and Mighty Mighty Bass Tones and if I had to choose between the two, it's from Reel Big Fish.... I wanna say it's the second song you sang?

If this isn't nice, then I don't know what is....  Spoiler  Spoiler "The whole story has it that as we go through life, we really don't change.... We just become more of the same....

 You may need to turn up your volume to truly experience this. Be warned, it gets pretty intense half way through. Here it is, one quarter of a triple chocolate cake: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0wGsg1TWahn

 LOL that's disturbing, but not as disturbing as mine.

 So far this might be my most favorite thread ever. Originally Posted by chibiurd07 it's from Reel Big Fish.... I wanna say it's the second song you sang? Nope, the second one is Spring-Heeled Jack. The third one I sang was Mighty Mighty Bosstones, though! I'd considered singing a Reel Big Fish but my voice doesn't match that dude's at all. Singing RBF songs sounds weird coming out of my mouth. @Shannon Venting is good. But you should mention your totally rad friends (like KT) as well! That poem was super creepy, though. :x 曾気青昭雄 Akio I hate listening to people eat so I didn't finish that but you got a laugh out of me. Mister I don't know whether to be freaked out or creeped out. Did we just invent Vocaroo arguing on A4?

However, I do remember when it would play in the movies and on the radio back in the day....

 Well this tread is interesting, but I guess that I might add something... http://vocaroo.com/i/s1VOoDzkGQZY The noise in the background is the fan, and excuse my grammar. 
  Spoiler 
 Just woke up and couldn't think of what to say =D http://vocaroo.com/i/s0l81FWMZVRV Also, this thread owns. Voice posts on forums have always owned. :] Edit: Shannon we all know you're from Nigeria, bro. 
 I had a hard time recording myself talking at basically nothing, so I wrote down what I wanted to say and just read it out so I wouldn't lose my train of thought, so yeah- I did sound like an infomercial probably. Also, I won't even get into your last two statements in your recording. Don't feel like derailing this fun thread!

 I'll tell you what, mister. How about we give you another try at that :3 Say something funny instead of critiquing someone else's post. I make another one tomorrow but not today.
