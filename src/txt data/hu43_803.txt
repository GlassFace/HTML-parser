 Picking up a new PC - is this one worth the cost?
 I'm interested in picking up a new PC, and what I basically want is the best bang for my buck in a plug and play PC. I'm not interested in searching for the parts individually and assembling it myself, and I'm perfectly content with paying a bit extra for the PC already assembled. Anyway, after a little poking around Google I found this for about $1300: ■OS : Windows 8 64■CPU : Intel® Core i7-3770K Processor (4 core/3.50GHz/8MB Smart Cache)■Graphics Card: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX670（2GB）■Memory: 16GB PC3-12800 (8GB×2/Dual Channel)■Hard Drive: 2TB SerialATAIII 7200rpm■Chipset: Intel® Z77 Express■Power Supply: 700W 【80PLUS® GOLD】 I haven't done that much searching and it's been forever since I bought a new PC, but this seems to be a pretty powerful machine. I'm just not completely sure about the price. Any ideas? 
 
 Ah you are going to want this to play those games am I right :P I'm just going to link you this the performance of your processor. http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/cpu...5-3570k_6.html Your processor seems to be pretty good. GPU seems be not bad either. 16 Gigs is pretty decent. Also I'm not a fan of windows 8, up to you though windows 7 is still better in my eyes. It has good ****, I'm not an expert on prices though so I'm not sure if you can get something BETTER for that price. You might also want to check if it has enough cooling, its pretty important.

 Is the GTX670 DDR5? (Can't remember off the top of my head). I've got the GTX660 Ti (2 Gb DDR5) in an Asus Tower with the i7-3770, complimented by 16Gb RAM. For the desktop, card, and power supply, it cost me near $1500. Going to eventually upgrade the card after Rome 2 comes out. I can run most games on the highest settings. You're good to go as your video card is a step above mine.

You're good to go as your video card is a step above mine. After a quick Google search it seems that yes, the GTX670 is DDR5. For another $100 I can actually get the GTX680, but I'm not sure it's worth the upgrade. I'm actually thinking about upgrading the cooling to liquid cooling (+$70, you're right Tak that it's important) for the lower amount of noise, plus my apartment gets wicked ****ing hot on summer days. 
 The value seems about right. Its pretty strong, but... windows 8 blugh... And you won't need $100 extra GPU, or Liquid cooling... but meh its up to you.

 Is Windows 8 really that bad? I think there's an option to downgrade to Windows 7... 
 Its a personal preference, I hate it.

 Its not that its bad... I think it was just more made for tablets/phones rather than computers. Also the fact that I hate new OS's I always wait a few years. XP is still my favourite, but the Dragresizeclip windows and aero desktop view in windows 7 are amazing. Put the 2 together = best OS.

 I would definitely use the downgrade option you should be able to upgrade later to Window 8 should it get fixed but as it is I would say it is broken.

Would you elaborate a bit? I get a lot of mixed messages online about how Windows 8 is more designed for a tablet, but then I've seen a lot of talk from people about how the ClassicShell interface of it is wonderful. 
 The Machine is great, but yes, you are packing a lot of heat. Figuratively and literally speaking. Liquid cooling would definitely be worth the investment considering your housing situation. I hope you enjoy your new PC!

 Really the main issues are that the operation of Windows 8 does not flow like Windows 7 does the systems interface is really designed for touch and gestures not for a mouse and keyboard. There is also the additional issue of software compatibility if you plan to use any older software you are going to be better off running it in Windows 7 where it as likely at least well known how to make the application work. I haven't kept up in the last month and a half on Windows 8 but I don't recall much or anything that has really gotten any of the major issues fixed for in when used in a desktop setup. In my past experience with downgrade options and rights you retain the rights to later install and use Windows 8 so downgrade is very nice route to go.

Liquid/Water cooling is an overpriced overly complicated solution there are plenty of ways to adequately cool any system, excluding some of the more extreme overclocks, with standard air cooling.

It's not about cooling just the machine, it's about cooling the machine without heating his room. Yes, there are great fans, but they draw the hot air away from his computer and spew it into his room. Given his situation, water cooling is the superior choice I believe.

 Missed the bit since it was in reply to something else and I don't read every post or all of every post I do read. I just don't find them worth the time but what ever. 
 I think your set up is fine. However, you may want to cut back on the processor, and upgrade the graphics card or get an SSD and HDD combo. It depends on what you intend to do the most with it. If gaming, a better gpu will give you more noticeable results. If you are mostly using it for graphics and video editing and transcoding, then a better CPU and SSD combo will serve you better. Do be careful of benchmarks. Most benchmark results may look nice, but they tend to not be noticeable in real world usage. As for cooling, you could always just put a bucket of water or ice in front of your fans and get good thermal paste. It is my golden rule to never jump at a new operating system. I like to wait at least a year for developers to work out bugs and increase compatibility. I would suggest hanging onto win 7 for now and upgrade later.

 Lame... no pictures on google, and too lazy to get a screenshot from my hard drive... But pfft liquid cooling is noob, go all out pro like the guy in summer wars. Ice cooling.

I suggest that if you do decide to get Windows 8, invest in StartIsBack instead of ClassicShell. I have not used it myself, but I think you should take a look at it. From what I have seen, StartIsBack looks like it works much better than ClassicShell. You do have to pay a bit for StartIsBack, but the investment is dirt cheap, so I don't think that would be a problem.

 The machine is fine, talking to the software, it's a matter of preference: really the major change in Windows 8 that is a big negative to people is no start button (Instead replaced with the 'start screen'; all the other start button functionality, like searching, etc. are also now the start screen). I mean you can generally keep yourself in 'desktop land' and generally avoid most of the new interface if you want, but you will have to see it anytime you'd have used a start menu in the past. Speaking to the positives: In terms of compatibility, it's actually compatible with more hardware than Windows 7 is (Though it likely shouldn't matter either way given the components you're getting are almost certainly fine with both), so it's much more rare that you have to do things like hunt around for drivers online or pop in driver CDs. Not only that, the general performance is faster than Windows 7 - booting up is faster, restarting/shutting down is faster, moving files is faster, CPU and memory usage are generally better for most things: http://usabilitygeek.com/windows-8-v...mance-testing/ So there are trade-offs - if you can stand the new interface you're rewarded with a generally faster and more efficient OS, but a lot of people can't get past the fact that it looks different.

 After reading through this thread and doing a bit more research, I can't find any reason to not go with Windows 8. I watched a few videos on Youtube about the functionality of it, and other than the annoying replacement for the start menu, it seems to be a pretty solid OS. I'll just patch the start menu once I get the computer and be done with that. The big thing with Windows 8 that I like is apparently you can change the language instantly. My current Windows 7 is in Japanese, and while I can find my way around stuff well enough, it gets annoying when I want to do something technical. Apparently on Windows 8 you can just immediately jump over to English without issue? Yeah, I'd say I'm pretty sold at this point. Thanks for all the comments. I'll go with the computer I mentioned in the OP, but just throw in liquid cooling. 
 I saw a picture of Nokia Lumia 920 phone with windows 8. It perfectly suits it and I reckon it looks AMAZING! But on a computer its damn terrible.

That's a great contribution to the thread there buddy. Unfortunately it seems that you forgot the part where you can take under 30 seconds to install an interface like Start8 that adds the start menu back, but actually with dramatically increased functionality over Windows 7. Kouketsu outlines how well in his post. Sorry, but beyond the "Windows 8 is for tablets and phones--not for PCs" rhetoric that has been regurgitated online nonstop for the past eight months, could you post a real criticism of the OS? I know it's cool to make friends by sharing opinions with everybody else no matter how little you know about a topic, but sometimes it's good to think a little for yourself and come to your own conclusions.
