[General Discussion] Happy 2015 everyone!
 I don't see it anywhere, so I guess I will be the first to wish you all a happy 2015! Felling really good right now lol! Just finished a bunch of Twilight Zone episodes with my room mates and friends and filled full of new years vodka, chambord and other stuff, so my new year is ringing in pretty good so far. I hope you are all doing good so far. I am fully looking forward to 2015 being a good year for me, the forums, and everything else in the world. I love you all very much and I hope your celebrations are going well. That is it for me for now. Good day to you all!
