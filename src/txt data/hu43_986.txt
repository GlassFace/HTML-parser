[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 It was a hell of a trainwreck throughout and the ending felt surprisingly tame. I was kinda disappointed in how normal and expected it all turned out after all the wacky plot twists and shark jumps that had been going on for two seasons. Okay show overall, I guess.
