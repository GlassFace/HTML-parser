 Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is great. 

 Toradora <--- just that 
Sand Cats are Bloody Adorable. 
 - Kaichou wa maid - sama. - comedy romance, you'll laugh your guts out. - Steins;Gate There's a great romance between Kurisu and Okabe in Steins;Gate, totally worth watching.

I recommend: - Kimi Ni Todoke: Really nice school romance - Angel Beats: Has action/supernatural, but is a good romance however is really sad. (may make you cry) - Clannad: One of the best anime ever, it is a romance, but it WILL make you cry. - Love Hina: Bit of comedy with the romance. - Maria+Holic: Really funny show, about a girl who likes girls and is allergic to boys. 
Anime watched: 73 My Youtube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/Uatemydoodle Kpop Thread: http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...4-K-pop-Anyone 
 http://myanimelist.net/animelist/RunawayPanda 97%+ of the animes of I have watched at least have a romance side plot Horror/Romance Mirai Nikki, Elfen Lied School Life/ Rom Kaichou wa Maid-same, Toradora, Clannad(for the 1st season, 2nd season its slice of life, also lots of drama so pull out them tissues!) Action/Romance Sword Art Online, Guilty Crown, Horizon on the Middle of Nowhere Those are just some of the ones that really stand out to me on my list And finally for my personal favorite, which is Romance/Action/School life/Magic/Harem(not annoying one)/Drama Zero No Tsukaima

I picked My Little Monster because it's the only romance anime I've watched besides Little Complex. 
 Boku no Pico. No, just kidding. Don't watch that unless you're a fan of little boy porn.

 what is up with Boku no Pico, I know what it actually is but why is it always getting mentioned in this freaking forum!?

 His and Her Circumstances, Kanon, Waiting in the Summer, True Tears(One of my all time favorites), Chobits (classic), SHuffle, Suzuka, Girls Bravo. Fun comedy romances: Midori Days, Maburaho, Kano Kon Action Romance: i loved Busou Renkin myself, Full metal Panic. Just depends if your looking for a specific type i guess.

Because people just want to watch the world burn. @OP, here are some Shoujo/Romance anime which you should always try: 1. Vampire Knight 2. Kyou Koi wo Hajimemasu 3. Say I Love You 4. Kaichou wa Maid sama 5. Kimi Ni Todoke

 Average run of the middle of romance... Ah My Goddess - sappy in the extreme and definitely romantic. (I prefer the manga) Samurai X - only because it's an extreme circumstances kinda love story. Yeah... oh jeez I'm in love with this. Love Hina - I'm recommending this for the adorable factor. That's all I got at the moment.

 I just started watching an anime called Aria the Scarlet Ammo. It's painfully obvious the main character is going to end up with Aria and have his own harem. That anime also reminded me of another anime called Is This a Zombie. Pretty funny romance/harem series. The best romances I ever saw were Seto no Hanayome (hilarious), Bakemonogatari (pretty cool but the romance is so cute), and Toradora (but what kind of romance fan hasn't seen Toradora?).

 Atsa isn't really a heram but i can see why you would think that. It's more or less a detective anime and honestly i never really considered it a romance

 Has no-one mention SAO, it actually kind of falls into the romance catergory, if you look at it right

 Originally Posted by Snype Has no-one mention SAO, it actually kind of falls into the romance catergory, if you look at it right It's a ****ing video game romance, that's autistic. Don't get me wrong it was a mediocre anime; I enjoyed it. However imagine an anime about some people inside World of Warcraft and they 'fall in love' that'd be so retarded and we all know it. Pretty much the same deal with SAO.
