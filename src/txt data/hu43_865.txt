[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Watched the first 4 eps, and up untill now it's so/so...L-Elf (ridiculous names by the way) is an ok char, Shoko and Haruto mweh, cybergirl is fresh...the rest I could care less up till now... At least the fight scenes and L-Elf escape were of the tsjisain. I'll be sitting this one out as wel, not because this show is such an eye opener, but cause I like the 2 planets fighting over 1 neutral planet concept. Storywise it has to do better, cause up till now it's kinda foggy and the (re)actions predictable. And also the whole social media, cell phone thingie is blown way outta proportion... 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
