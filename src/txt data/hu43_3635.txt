[Supernatural] Shinmai Maou no Testament
 My first ever new show post!!!! Source: https://livechart.me/winter/all trailer:  Spoiler Production IMS January 8, 2015 at 01:35 JST Light Novel 12 eps The "rather risque battle action" story centers around Basara Tōjō, a first-year high school student who is flustered by a sudden question by his eccentric father, "Hey, didn't you used to say you wanted a little sister?" Plus, his father announces that he is getting remarried. His father brings over two beautiful step-sisters, but then embarks on an overseas trip. However, the two sisters Mio and Maria Naruse are actually a novice devil and succubus. Basara almost ends up forming a dangerous servant and master contract with them, but due to an error, the contract becomes reversed, and Basara becomes the master instead. To add to things, erotic situations continuously start to happen in Basara's life. However, it turns out Mio is having her life targeted by other monsters and heroes. And so, the "desire/action" tale of the strongest contracter begins. ---------------------- I don't know the proper procedure for posting info for a new show so I just gave all the info I could. I included the original link of where I got this. It looks to be a bit like highschool dxd. I will definitely check this one out I hope you will too

 I dunno. It stinks of harem but the girls...they're getting to me. Damn these well drawn 2D chicks. 
 So you take "I couldn't become a hero so I got a job" combine it with "High school DxD", then you throw Kotori from "Date a Live" into the show and give her bigger breasts and your final anime is Shinmai Maou No Testament. Red haired main girl doing Devilish things. I mean Ill watch it because it gave me some laughs and the voice acting was good but jeeze these Devil ideas are running low haha. 

 Oh what am I saying? Promoting harem anime and fanservice plots in the industry by watching them? I'll go back to my Gundam, yeah.

Well if you're already hating it before I've even seen the first show it must be right up my ally But remember we like log horizon, angel beats and the wixoss series so we can agree on some things

 We can. I'm such a shmuck when it comes to ecchii, harem, or fanservice revolving plots in anime. I really don't like how the industry currently survives on an abundance of the stuff, a mild amount used tastefully is good but a plot like this? These "Sexual situations" in the harem anime above are just snaps and grabs to the viewer's weak sides that I frankly think degrade the entire industry. Remember Black Bullet and Rail Wars? You loved them, I lost them. Far back was SAO, but we both maturely agreed to disagree on that series. Yeah, my tastes are a bit more stricter than your fun-loving attitude. We're both happy though.

Well what about things like zombie shows in live action movies/TV? Or cop shows for goodness sake? Its hard to come up with original ideas anymore. But sometimes it does seem like they don't try hard enough, I'll grant you that. Originally Posted by Shmuser Name We can.

Understood So what's the music like in no testament? Is it good old rock riffs? Classical orchestral music? Something else?

 Broda I didn't even watch the first episode. That may sound displeasing, but it's a truth I'm comfortable with. I assume the anime probably has some alternative rock because "DEVILS AND SUCCUBI AND CONTRACTS YEAH *****ES" 
 The first episode was not bad, the animation is fantastic, and it's fan service could be compared to the early episodes of Grisaia. And Yoda I do not watch Television unless it's animated OR Seinfeld. But I would LOVE to see another Zombie anime, there are not many out there, Sankerea, Is this a Zombie? and HSOTD are the only 3 off the top of my head. IM sure there are more but Im just throwing out 3 quick ones. Black Bullet had lolis doing things which was cool and different, but they could have made it SO much better. 

 Sankarea manga ending oh my goodness what trash 
 Wow! Loved it! still not fan of harems, but if he ends up with all of them I won't mind. I just hope that demon lord girl doesn't turn out to be goody two shoes and tsundere...that will totally ruin her character. 
  Spoiler "If the king does not lead, how can he expect his subordinates to follow?"
 Cool! Though why do the dad and son have those scars? This will definitely be enjoyable

I'm guessing that's  Spoiler why he doesn't react shocked to the magic? He's got some immunity to it? Or is it a harry potter thing? They got scars from some dark lord in their sleep? And I guess that means there mom is some devil priestess.

 Damn the episode 2 I've watched was censored. So far I am enjoying it.

 Originally Posted by The Murder Recipe Damn the episode 2 I've watched was censored. So far I am enjoying it. Yes indeed!!! I'll have to preorder the blurays to solve that issue! Its like a perfect ripoff of highschool dxd. But it has enough of a different story to make it enjoyable.

 Yuki is best girl. Period. 

 So Mio will turn out to be just another stereotypical annoying girl with a crush... not badass devil...that's just great(sarcasm)... I'm starting to hate the stereotypes in anime...

I'm starting to hate the stereotypes in anime... I don't think so. I'm sure this will turn out to be highschool dxd in reverse. Her love for the main guy will unleash her power - the same way issei did anything to protect what's her name in dxd. Give it some more time js

Give it some more time js But her character already ruined the whole badass thing... and I really don't want it to be Highschool dxd... because it would be just a cheap copy of it. Let's face it this anime will never live up to Highschool dxd and that is a fact.

But we all have different tastes. So I won't hold it against you if you bail

So I won't hold it against you if you bail Well I don't think I'm being harsh just truthful to what I think. And I'm not bailing. As much as I think that Mio as a character sucks the plot is quite interesting. So I will stick with it, though I will probably complain... alot...

 Already arguments involving Highschool DxD oh my goodness How much more ecchii harem genre can this thread be inflated with?
