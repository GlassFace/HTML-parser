[Anime] Which shows were better than you expected?
 Even though I knew it was good from reviews I was really surprised at how much I loved my spice and wolf blurays. I really grooved on the show. It was very enjoyable. The kawaii complex was another. Its a sweet ROM com. The reactions are the key part of it. So what shows surpassed your expectations?
