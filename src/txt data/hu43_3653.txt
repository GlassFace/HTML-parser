 Danish royals celebrate magnificent New Year banquet in Copenhagen
 Every year, Queen Margrethe hosts a New Year banquet, which is one of the main events in the Danish royal household. Here, the royal ladies dress up in their finest gala dresses and wear some of the spectacular pieces of jewellery from the royal vault. This year was no exception, and many had gathered at Amalienborg Palace excited to catch a glimpse of the royals, as they arrived. There’s a strict order in which the royals arrive — Her Majesty Queen Margrethe always arrives as the last person together with the Prince Consort. After the Danish government had arrived, came first Prince Joachim and Princess Marie. Next came Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary — probably the most popular person of the evening judging from the crowds — and lastly, Queen Margrethe and Prince Consort Henrik arrived in the finest of the royal cars. It’s a Rolls Royce Silver Wraith seven seater from 1958 and mostly used at big official events, such as the New Year banquet, or for official state visits to Denmark.
