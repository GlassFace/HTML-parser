 Shannon by a light year. KT might've made it a close race had Tova senpei and BullyLee not driven him away from the boards with their facts and misigneez and that. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Shannon Apple because I see her around more

 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses. Beside you as you like softly down, I will be until I hear the words "Checkmate". ~Sebastian Michaelis ~ Individual 4 ~ A4's Greatest Villain <Right Here Lmao

 The moderators are fair people. I finally learned to do something else. And given that they've been using the power of the Life Stream, it seems to me that I shall put this sign up:  Spoiler The Moderators are ⊂_ヽ 　 ＼＼ ＿ 　　 ＼(　_) F 　　　 <　⌒ヽ A 　　　/ 　 へ＼ 　　 /　　/　＼＼ B 　　 ﾚ　ノ　　 ヽ_つ 　　/　/ U 　 /　/| 　(　(ヽ L 　|　|、＼ 　| 丿 ＼ ⌒)O 　| |　　) / U `ノ )　　Lﾉ/S ////////////////////A ////////////////////// N Just happened to find it lying in a Hajime no Ippo section of the aisle. And no, I do not want a part-time job as a moderator. Because I'd be pretty horrible at it. And damn, I've got stuff I want to watch in like five minutes. Crap. 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
 Voted KT. The only mod to act on the complaints against Peter, and give him a permanent boot. 
Individual Eleven: Rise Up. Never conform. 
 KT got rid of Mihstah when other mods watched him do horrible things, even after he'd been reported by underaged girls such as myself before.
