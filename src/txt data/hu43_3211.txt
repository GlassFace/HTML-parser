 Well this is a new story I'll be working on along side any of my other story's I may be working on. So I guess there is a main story I am working on like Soul Cry or Encounter at the moment, even my Bloodline or Kings series but this is a stand alone which won't tie into my other series at all. It's a slice of life story/romance/mystery and is kind of based off the idea of the Breakfast Club even though I've never seen that movie only bits of it but I'm familiar enough with it that I get the general idea behind it. The story's format will be journal entry's from each of the four characters. Well, enjoy my attempt at this I'll probably get the first chapter out today besides this prologue. This image represents my May Castner character. I always like an image to go with my story so this is it for now, unless I find a better one which I hope to. Prologue; Journal Entry 82 - Luke  Spoiler I hate to have this sound like some corny movie narration, but to understand our story we’ll begin from the start, not that that contradicts what I just wrote, but what happened to us, is to say the least… Extraordinary. During our freshmen year, the first day to be precise is when all of this began. All of the students were handed a blue notecard that had two boxes to check with a single word next to each. One was accept while the other was decline. The instructions given with the notecard whereas followed. “If you accept or decline it won’t matter, just put your full names on the back and pass them up once you’ve finished. Please don’t leave them blank.” The others would later tell me that they had all checked the accept box, I included. Though we didn’t give it much thought until the following year when each of us were given a leather bound notebook and told to write down our findings. We were ask to open the notebook after school was out that day. Getting home a little late, I went to my bedroom to open the journal to find out what Mrs. Keen had meant when she told me to write down my findings. Follow the rumors. Besides that the page also gave some simple instructions to think of the notebook like a personal journal and write down your day to day activates. We would have our grade risen one letter if we did well. Shrugging I accepted, never thinking twice of what it all meant. I saw it as a fun game, within the instructions we’re told to keep the notebook hidden for there are five other with one, each of us are supposed to listen in the halls for the rumors and write down what we find and I found mine a few days into the start of the new school year. Kaycee. Just a name, and nothing more. Not even a last name. Our job is to become friends with the other notebook holders or at least try and see if we’ll remain friends. This is basically like finding a random person at the mall and striking a conversation with them. It’s not that easy for any of us to have friendships though. But me being as stubborn as I am, I like to figure things out, to understand. That’s who I am. Curiosity killed the cat. That fits. But we did, all of us. Even though one was my brother however our relationship has never been solid until after what happened. To be honest I found out my brother had one pretty easily, came into his room one night and the leather bound book was right on his desk. Vince Stein. May Castner. Mami Saotome. Ricky Ovrille. …and Kaycee. We’re now friends. I’ll end this last entry here, there isn’t anything more to be said, and the police are here to gather our notebooks to present them as evidence in the conviction… 502 Words Edit 1: Did a bit of editing, I can't figure out how to add the 4th character...Ricky if you remember what I posted earlier so he's out of the story. Edit 2: ...Ricky has to be in there, my story won't make sense with only 4 characters...well it will but I'm slowly see how I can use Ricky in the story and he just belongs. I also reworded and edited the prologue, enjoy.
