 Jack Kirby's birthday
 See my pic, you know I'm interested in the king. I did watch a doco on him and Lee's careers, can't explain why I've become so interested in their work, must be the untold power we all have, they never knew they could create such an impact from these drawings and stories, and now they're the biggest attractions in the world. Oh anyway, Happy Birthday Mr. Kirby
