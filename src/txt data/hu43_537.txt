 A4 Skin v1.0
 I saw Knuckles on site earlier, he may have re-enabled the ads.

Shian is more the day to day manager whereas I am a bit more backend. As for the ads, the goal with making them "smarter" is to target them a bit more. So game ads in the games areas, design ads in the design areas, geeky/science/tech in the Science and Tech areas and so on. As for who they show to. They currently show to everyone except for donators. They may come and go for various groups while we are testing stuff over the next month or so.
