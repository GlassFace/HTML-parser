 Hey guys! I'm about to take my last final, and its about 3 am (It's online) ugh! Long story short, Because it's Texas, our weather has been really crazy. School ended up being cancelled for 6 days. Not to mention the power ended up going out in my dorm, so I was luckily able to spend the night at one of my friends apartments. But what did that do to finals week? It pushed all my exams back, so I'm in the process of packing my room, to move out, taking my exam, and getting to go back to my home. Finals week has been the absolute worse, and so stressful, but I'm so happy this semester is over finally! And I will def. be back more ( I know I said that before, but now that I have no school, I'm for realz this time!) But tomorrow, Ill head back to my house, and then from 3pm to 11pm I have work ( I work at one of the most popular malls in south. So the hours are crazy!) Sigghhhhh! but I'll be here after! I've just been so busy. But I haven't given up on this rp, at all, and I'll put all my energy back into this. 

 Wow, Danny. I don't know. I was about to pull the plug. I mean, it's been 4 months, and I tried the alternate storyline for other RPers, but that did not seem to work. And with you gone, having your major component within it, it was like losing a vital organ. My last attempt would have been to scrap the existing storyline and create a fresh one, removing any ties with your characters. I feel like we lost many of our companions. I may be wrong, but to me, only Force Felix, Harlequinn, Myameohmy, and I are the only ones checking back. And Danny, I know real life comes first, and that finals, and your safety are most important, but sometimes an update, even a small one would be nice. Also, good luck with your finals and have fun moving back into your house.

 So...couple questions. The RP will, in fact, be picking up again? If so, is it still possible to join? I know there's 30+ pages of IC content in place, so no hard feelings if we can't. Just wanted to ask before I made that decision haha. 
 
 Hey Randoms! Just seeing what you said. And I would have totally understand. You're absolutely right. And I'm really sorry. The decision is up to you guys now. I'm truly sorry for being such an inconvenience.. But I made a post, and Merry Christmas everyone. I hope you're all having a great one. Let me know what you guys want to do. @Chesire you can certainly join. Because of my absence, I've caused a lot trouble. It's up to others if they want to continue. In which I totally understand if they wouldn't. About my post: I could of added a lot more (Hence the missing Kelaras part/ and the lack of Hana&Memphis part) But I figured that was good enough. So Randoms, with the "event" I mentioned, you can make that whatever, and then go on and have you Memphis do what he was going to do. And Mya, I'll add my kelaras part, after the first person replies.I just wanted to post something. I was working on that post for the past week. (That is if you guys want to continue) 

 I'm game to continue. As long as we set a schedule for when we need to post. Like a deadline. Also, maybe making some of the posts a bit smaller would help. I know that it can be really daunting when you feel the need to post a huge reply, but sometimes short and sweet works too. If anything, it would help with consistency in our posts until we get momentum again. 
 Ok that sounds like a very good idea. And I'll def try to make my posts shorter, it's just since my characters are interacting with a lot of other peoples, I feel like I have to make sure I respond to everyone(So no one has to wait any longer), while also pushing along the story line enough, so it doesn't feel like we're staying in one place. But I'll def try to make it short. 

 YAY! What a great surprise to check in here on my birthday and see that Danny's posted!

 Oh my Danny. I feel bad now for what I said. I must say I was not expecting such a large post from you, and the fact that you left stuff out? Wow. Yeah, you can take it easy. And happy late birthday Harlequinn Glad to hear you guys had a nice christmas. I will make my post soon. 
  Spoiler 
 Don't feel bad Randoms lol. And ok How was your christmas?

  Spoiler 
 That's good Randoms! AND Yeah lets make Glass academy live on! Happy New Years Everyone! 

 Thanks Danny, you too. I'll start working on a post, but I don't know if I'll be able to get it up anytime soon. I haven't been feeling well and I've been stressing out about these school projects I have to do. I have to write a big, dumb research report, then make a flash animation.

 Name: Sólás Indurare Age: ~10,000; Appears 23 Gender: Male Species and Abilities: Zodiac (Pisces); Manipulation/Control of Emotions, Mind reading, Mental shielding Relationship Status: Single Position: Student Appearance Description: 5'9" with a trim, athletic build. He has shaggy blonde hair and blue-green eyes. He typically wears jeans and a form-fitting t-shirt. He also always wears a leather strap necklace with a small, blue-green gem in the shape of Pisces zodiac symbol. Brief History: Sólás has few memories of his life before becoming one of the 12 embodiments of the Zodiac. He is aware that he was once a normal human but, his only memories of those days are of first meeting his new brothers and sisters as they explained his new life amongst them. Every 2000 years, at the end of each astrological age, the embodiment of that age's sign selects his/her successor. Pisces, being the final sign of the zodiac, is the longest living of the twelve (living ~24,000 years) and acts as a mentor for all of his/her brothers and sisters as well as their successors. Sólás has come to Glass Academy in search of Virgo's successor, who's ascension has caused her to lose her memories. Early or Late Class: Early Other: Sólás uses his ability to manipulate emotions primarily to keep those around him happy and calm. In order to maintain his ability his must "feed" off the emotions of others, so rather than drain others of all of their emotions he has chosen to focus his efforts on feelings of anxiety, anger, sadness, etc. While this leaves others feeling happy and serene, it stresses Sólás. Although he enjoys the company of others, he has to set aside blocks of time to be alone so he can meditate in order to control the negative emotions he absorbs. Also, since his abilities have little offensive capabilities, he has trained in hand-to-hand and knife combat. He keeps a personalized combat knife in each of his boots. 
 
 Interesting character Chesire. However, I have some reservations. THe concept is fine, but what makes him sure that the Virgo incarnate is attending Glass? Also if he is over 10 millennia old and appears 23, he would not be a student. He would need to be a part of the faculty. Otherwise he would not be able to get close to campus. 
  Spoiler 
 Ah, bloody hell haha. He isn't sure that she's there, but he's heard of Glass and it's student/faculty base. Even though the girl lost her memories she still has all of Virgo's abilities. Without her memories she wouldn't have any basis for understanding her abilities and may seek out help in learning how to develop them. So, Solas is more or less hoping that Glass is his best shot at finding either the girl or clues about where she is.....all of this was something I meant to put down, but I guess I spaced on it. Which faculty spots are still available? I saw the list on the OP, but I wasn't sure if that had been updated or not. If it has, then I'd like the English teaching position.
