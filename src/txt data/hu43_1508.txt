 What's your high school life look like?
 It's been a while since high school...The classes would normaly start at 08:00, and normally would last until 13:00 or 13:45, depending on if he had 6 or 7 periods. The kids nowadays switch morning and afternoon shifts every week which sucks if you ask me. We had some clubs and after school activities, but i was actually never interested in any of them. At least, for comparision, i see my school would enslave me for an hour or two shorter than most of you. And we supposedly had one of the toughest school systems in europe 10 years ago, don't know about now
