 Man Dies After 3 Day Video Game Binge
 Today I came across this video. It's really just a powerpoint that gives the outline of this ambiguous story to some elevator music. It was just...weird. But if you don't want to watch it yourself, this is what it said: 1) A man in Taiwan died after a 3 day video game binge. 2) It was reported that the man regularly used the cafe and played for days at a time. 3) Police say his cardiac arrest is contributed to cold temperatures and exhaustion. 4) This is the second video gamer to die in Taiwan this month. 5) In the first death, the man played for 5 straight days. ...the way this story is presented by CNN bothers me a lot more than the story itself. http://www.cnn.com/videos/video-land...iref=obnetwork
