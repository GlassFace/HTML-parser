[General Discussion] What's your motto?
 So do you have a motto? A catchphrase that people would associate with you? I guess mine would be: TAKE IT EASY! Yep I'm a pretty laid back kind of guy. I do get worked up about scifi, video games, and a little thing called sword art online.... But other than that I'm pretty mellow..... How about you? What word or phrase would people associate with you?
