 well no one's forcing you to participate in it. I'm running the RP how i want to run it, if it doesn't work for you your welcome to leave.

 I'm also going to need a little time before creating an antagonist. I don't want to make up something bad on the spot.

 It's cool, take as much time as you need.

 tweaked the weaknesses a little 
Be yourself and never give into what otherd say.
 I'm also not sure if I'll be staying in the rp... it's really confusing me and I feel as though the storyline is taking a backseat to everything else. :$ I'm still working on an antagonist, though. I'm not sure if I'm leaving. 
 Titus and Marga <33! 
 Well we will officially Start the story once this mission finishes. It's taking longer than i had planned

 Hey man, I'm aware you're the GM (respect the GM, very important balance and value in a roleplay) and I just might leave. Your RP is peculiar, unrewarding, and unenjoyable to me. However i'm open-minded enough not to just cut ties and burn bridges. If I ever were to leave, it would be on a respectful terms which acknowledge your effort and passion for your RP and my reasoning as to why I did not feel that it was as fulfilling to me as it was to others. Mind your tone Sytis, people look for good characteristics in others, no decency is earned through the type of message you're sending.

 Just been keeping an eye on this RP, (not joining cause not interested in the idea) but I notice a few of you feel like you want to drop out. I wouldn't necessarily throw in the towel if you don't have to. Talk about some ideas and expand on your posts if you feel like you havent got much to post on. A longer post can bring in detail that others can work on. Anyways, just saying that cause it's nice seeing an RP with so much involvement and it would be a shame to see a couple of you leave due to idea blocks. Keep it up.

 I'm legitimately surprised my slutty ass, half-hearted character got accepted. Hey, if you're going to make an enemy then have fun with it folks! I can't wait. 
 I'll make mine soon

I'm guessing Badguy/Guybad is a comic relief. Also sorry for putting words in your bro's mouth in my last IC post Shmuser.

Let me tell you something. the reason i make RPs in the first place to just have fun. there is literally almost no reason for me to turn down a character sheet. if you make a character sheet, as long as you RP correctly, i don't care what it is.
