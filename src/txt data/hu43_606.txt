 Fantasy Books
 If any of you like the idea of helpless, street rat becoming a master assassin, I'd suggest the Night Angel Trilogy. It's set in a fantasy world, that has magic, and it's pretty much everything I've hoped for in a book. It starts a bit slow though, what with the background of everything since it's a brand new world.
