 RIP Monty Oum
 Monty Oum: The man behind RWBY, Dead Fantasy, Haloid, Red vs Blue has just passed away. Very shocking, back in the day he was a great inspiration to me and he still is, but man I didn't know he would suddenly just go out like that. He was 33 years old... RIP Monty, you'll be remembered as a legend. LINK: http://roosterteeth.com/members/journal/?uid=6
