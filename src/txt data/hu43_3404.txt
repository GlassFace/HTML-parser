 The Big 3 Manga (Is is worth it?)
 Naruto is worth it until shippuden. Unless your just a hardcore fan. It is not worth reading unless you want to hunt down certain sections of the manga afterward. Bleach is worth it, skip the first half of the aizen ark to save headache and time. OnePiece is worth it, but if you find yourself bored. Just skip to the CP9 ark and start from there.
