[OOC] Code: RED
 The Story: The time is 2109 The world had been at peace till the end of WW3. But now there's nowhere safe to run. The population is overrun with gangs and violence induced riots. The leaders of the United Nations have been forced to step down and were lynched if they refused to do so. The self defence forces around the world were demolished and only a few bases where left somewhat intact. The civilian population quivered in fear as the Opressers, a group of corrupt military personnel bent on world domination, marched through streets across the nations. Finally it became to much for the remaining self defense forces to handle. They decided to group there efforts and create one big organization for controlling the roits and dealing with the Opressers. The name of this organization was named Valhalla after the viking haven. The story is centered around agents who are gathered and put into an assult team in the North America branch of Valhalla. There job is to try to make the U.S. a safe haven once more or die trying. The Members The members of Valhalla are anything but normal. When they were first admitted, they went through excruciating training, that left some of them traumatized. But the thing that distinguishes them the most is the fact that they are all genetically altered humans. Since they are only a select few, they needed something that would give them the upper hand. So Valhalla's scientists, dipped their hands into genetic engineering. Everyone that survived the experiments developed powers of a sort, unique to them and that could not be copied. they ceased to be just human, and are now classified as extremely dangerous. Rules: 1: NO GODMODDING 2: try to keep your character's strength reasonable. I don’t mind if they're a little OP, but make it so there is a chance that your character can be beat in a fight 3: refrain from one-liners. I don’t mind if it’s only once or twice because you can’t think of anything else to say, but keep it at a minimum 4:I f you have any ideas for the RP, or just want to ask a question, PM me 5: If you want you character sheet to be accepted put "Revamp" at the top 6: I will timeskip every night unless it has to do with the story, and if I think the story is moving to slow. 7: I do not mind side events, but try to stay with the main story as well 8: If you have to leave, cut off any interactions before you do so. 9: If you are interacting with someone, make sure not to post to the point where others cannot keep up Character Design: Name: Codename: Age: Gender: Ethnicity: What Do they specialize in?: What Power do they possess?: Appearance: Short Bio: Personality: > Strengths: (keep them reasonable) > Weaknesses: > Fears: (must have a fear.)

 Revamp Name: Genevieve "Gena" Thorton Codename: Pulse Age: 14 Gender: Female Ethnicity: White What Do they specialize in?: The peace maker, specializes in communication. Also has some botany and first aid skills- can make simple medicines, disinfect and dress wounds with plant life. Also knows which plants are poisonous. What Power do they possess?: Magnetic shield. Appearance: Short Bio: N/A Personality: Quiet and a little shy, and still rather innocent. She hates violence. She will go to any lengths to reach a compromise and make peace. > Strengths: Can pull metal objects toward her and redirect them with varying force (a sort of magnetic shove). Her shield protects her from metal objects. Other people can be protected by her shield to a maximum of 10 feet if she exerts herself. Her shield can mess up nearby electronics and she can send out pulses that mess up electronics (and slightly push metal objects) in a larger area (depending on how much energy she expends). The rigorous Valhallan training makes her faster than normal people, and she's physically stronger than she appears. > Weaknesses: Non-magnetic items easily pass through her shield. It's next to impossible for her to use her shield offensively (the few times being if she repels/redirects a large metal object and it crushes someone near her outside of her shield. She cannot repel/"shoot" a bullet/small metal object with enough force to do real harm) Her shield can mess up nearby electronics (she needs to be very careful not to get too near or touch ally electronics). She is physically small- a single exceptionally strong/large human can still subdue her if she's caught by surprise. > Fears: Insects, most animals, most humans, the dark Other:

 Revamp Name: Nero Codename: Death's Son Age: 24 Gender: M Ethnicity: Japanese Weapon: Dual pistols and eight laser enhanced katanas What Do they specialize in?: He is a strategist, as well as an expert martial artist. He excels the most at sword fighting, being un-rivaled by anyone. Appearance: > Hair/Head Accessory: None > Accessories: Combat gloves and a wristwatch that has many different functions. > Anything else of note: He has a black dragon tattoo that spans his entire back General Background: Nero used to be known as Carter. Carter had no background. Anything involving his past had been destroyed, with only his real name being left. Carter lead the 1st Division assault team, until he Mutated due to a long term effect of being genetically engineered. He turned into Nero, who know leads the North American Assault team. He is nothing like Carter, except for when it comes to battle expertise and his powers. He is now a being made of pure energy. On par with the director of the entire Valhalla organization. He now lives for his job, and his only regret is ever being created. Personality: Nero has a very dark and unemotional personality. He seems to care about no one, just their combat strength and how useful they would be in battle. If he had a choice, he would most likely work alone, but since he doesnt, he leads the team with extreme expertise. > Strengths: All of Nero's strength's revolve around Combat experience. Due to how long he has been fighting, he is to the point where he can somewhat predict another person's moves > Weaknesses: Since he is a being of energy, anything that can stop energy from circulating is dangerous for him > Habits/Quirks: None > Fears: That he will disappear before he can finish his job Other: Nero's body is slowly deteriorating. Soon, he will literally become energy, and disperse into the atmosphere

 @ Sytis: What kind of energy is your guy composed of? It might be pretty cool if your guy could ride Gena's pulse waves to make attacks and cover longer distances, or she could redirect him so has a wider dodge range, things like that. 
 skype: takkune07 
 He's just energy in general. He can light up a room, and at the same time power an electrical object. If you get to close he puts off heat as well. So he probably could ride her pulse wave/ make it stronger

 Oi! Can we please have some more information? What is the current condition of the world after WWIII? Is mostly everything is nuked and unstable. Who is currently in charge in different regions, what and how does Valhalla operate and what technology is currently available for use in the world both domestically and militarily? Who are the Oppressors? I really like the plot idea so far, but please sharpen up your grammar just a bit? Character Design: Average height for a young male, medium build and defined muscle tone, fair skin with a hue of gold to the skin pigmentation. Wears dark black, light weight, and moisture wicking tabi military combat boots. Outfitted in multicam colored and slightly loose combat trousers. These pants are complimented with contoured, padded, flexible armor similar to riding gear which is also colored multicam. On my upper body, I wear a gossamer-like, hooded poncho which possesses a pattern of thick, lush foliage. Beneath my poncho and strapped to my body is a lightweight and thin harness with black straps. On both vertical straps are small satchels forming a bandolier, each one has a different colored gemstone buckle. On my back, located on the straps above my waist and hips are a couple of large pouches. My dark-brown hair is kept messy and just below being considered medium length, and I have black highlights streaking through my hair. My tips of my ears are oddly elongated and pointed, slanted at an angle like an elf. My eye sclera is vividly black, and my irises change color according to whatever supernatural power I have at the time. Name: Trenton Barusche Codename: Whistler Age: Early twenties (21) Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian What Do they specialize in?: Wilderness survival, Tracking and Trapping, Faith, Sneaking What Power do they possess?: Seasonspeech (I can manipulate certain aspects of the weather despite the current climate, ex. speed and direction of wind, cloud movements, strength and summoning of precipitation and sunshine, etc). My irises change color in correlation to what powers I am implementing.. My iris color flashes between green and blue when I conjure, strengthen, or weaken a storm due to the use of wind and precipitation. My iris color becomes pure white when I am involved in snowfall or blizzard related weather. My iris becomes amber or bright gold when it is a clear sky and I focus rays of sunlight. If I wanted complete darkness in the night or in a cloudy area, which would mostly likely never happen, my eyes would go entirely black and beady. Short Bio: Initially an up and coming Army Ranger, Valhalla scouters reined me in and transformed me into a mutated super soldier. Not much info to really build a story on, so this is it for now. Personality: Sociable, Has high morals and values, a bit charismatic, intelligent, prone to taking risks (bravery), easily agitated > Strengths: (keep them reasonable) Excellent outdoorsman, relatively fit, modestly proficient in close quarters combat, sharp and sneaky, animal and fish friendly, adept at ranged and low-tech weapons such as hunting bows or throwing knives. > Weaknesses: I can only use Seasonspeech through verbal implementation. I am self-conscious about my ears. > Fears: (must have a fear.) Depths, Pure darkness, Fear of unexpected harm coming to close ones 
 Sorry if it's not up to your standards (not being sarcastic or anything), but most of the questions you just asked are meant to be answered in the RP. technology; created as the RP goes on. regions; deeply rooted in the storyline. and so on. So forgive me if i don't answer those, it would just ruin a lot. And your CS is accepted

 Revamp Name: Liam Byrnes Codename: Reaver Age: 24 Gender: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian What Do they specialize in?: Blade combat (carries two custom sickles) and bomb making/defusing What Power do they possess?: Energy Absorption; Liam can absorb moderate amounts of energy (i.e. heat, electricity, bullets, small explosions) and release it as either a tool/weapon/etc. Appearance: 59, shaggy blonde hair and green eyes. Hes toned and athletic, but not overly muscular. He wears dark, worn combat fatigues, a form fitting white Henley style t-shirt and a silver Celtic cross on a chain around his neck. He carries two sickles, one sharp/one serrated, in a belt holster at the small of his back. Liam also carries various handheld explosives on a belt across his chest. Short Bio: Liam grew up in Northern Ireland, listening to stories about his great grandfathers time as a sapper and demolitions expert in the military. On his 18th birthday he decided to enlist and follow in his great grandfathers footsteps. While he was extremely skilled with explosives he also showed skill with blades, particularly sickles. Near the end of the war, as the Oppressors came into power, his unit was called on to evacuate a civilian triage center near Los Angeles. Amongst the patients and personnel were his two younger sisters, Kyra and Charlotte. Both had attended med school and volunteered to help in the L.A. triage centers and refugee camps. As the bus carrying Kyra, Charlotte and many of the remaining patients fled the facility an Oppressor IED detonated, setting the bus ablaze and killing all of its passengers. Liams ensuing hatred toward the Oppressors and his skills with explosives caught the eye of the Valhalla project and he jumped at the opportunity to get revenge against the people who murdered his sisters. Personality: Liams very friendly, sociable and kind when around those he considers close. He enjoys spending time with whomever he views as a friend, but often wanders off to any quiet place he can find, typically somewhere high with a view. He refuses to share anything about his past and merely smiles/acts the fool/changes the subject when asked. Though outwardly warm and cheery with his squad/friends, he keeps his anger just under the surface and only wears a more hollow grin when hes upset. > Strengths: (keep them reasonable) Liam excels in hand-to-hand/blade combat, is exceptionally gifted with explosives and has a warm, charismatic personality > Weaknesses: Liam is mediocre with firearms at best and tends to allow his anger to get the better of him in high stress situations > Fears: (must have a fear.) Absorbing too much energy/losing control of his powers and drowning (hes a strong swimmer, but deep water scares him s***less) Other: Liam considers himself the best bladesman he knows. He admires Neros skill with a sword and is constantly nudging him to spar, but Nero always turns him down 
 
 Well I'll be putting up my character anyways then. Let me know. Name: Fumiko Nakamura Codename: Red Maiden Age: 17 years old Gender: Female Ethnicity: Japanese What Do they specialize in? Fumiko is specialized in martial arts and katana wielding. Shes unbelievably quick on her feet and moves like water, she is fluid and agile. What Power do they possess? Fumiko manipulates water in all its forms at will. Appearance: She is a very beautiful girl with standard Japanese facial features. She has almond shaped eyes with blue irises and thin eyebrows. Her skin tone is a milky white color and appears to be visually flawless. Fumiko has long, black hair that reaches her knees. She keeps her hair up in a ponytail during battle, since it gets in the way. She stands tall at about 5 feet and 7 inches. Her body is elegant and curvy yet toned, somewhat like a dancers body.  Spoiler Short Bio: At young age (approximately 5 years old), Fumiko and her twin brother got kidnapped in their hometown, Osaka, by American scientists. They had been kidnapped because of the Nakamura name in Japan as being some of the strongest Japanese fighters. When her and her twin, Yoshirou, got taken into the lab back in the United States, they were experimented on. The researchers and scientists responsible for the twins wanted to test the mysterious ability twins had: reading each others minds. While performing experiments, they found that Fumiko and Yoshirou were capable of manipulating water/ice and fire/heat respectably. After finding this out, the scientists were excited to see what else they could uncover in these mysterious powers. By doing so, they killed Yoshirou when he was 10 years old. Fumiko was enraged and froze everybody in the secret lab, and then killing them. She escaped the lab and ranaway. Personality: Fumiko wears a lady-like mask towards strangers. However, she is a sharp- tongued young woman who speaks honestly and harshly. She doesnt appreciate people who are weak-willed and give up without trying hard enough. She does have a kind heart, and will show it without speaking of it. Shes street smart and a quick-thinker. > Strengths: For what Fumiko lacks in raw strength, she makes up in her speed and agile movements. Shes light on her feet and incredibly aware of her body, making her an amazing melee combatant. She is also extremely confident in her own skills, making her a formidable opponent. > Weaknesses: Fumiko has next to no training in firearms and long ranged weapons. > Fears: She fears losing another loved one such as she lost her beloved brother. So she will fight to the death if it means selfishly dying before the other loved one.

 I'd done my first RP in the World War 4: Enter into a world of the past thread which had a similar vibe to this one but there was a lack of direction and hence players quit. I too ran out of ideas and stopped posting. I hope CODE:RED does not come to an abrupt end. I'll try my best this time. REVAMP: Character Design: Name: Enok Codename: DEVIL Age: Unknown, but is young Gender: Male Ethnicity: Unknown, but has traces of a Danish bloodline.

Appearance: Short Bio: N/A Personality: A silent recluse who tends to fit well into Valhalla and actually has a caring side to himself, though not evident. Talks only when necessary and is able to provide guidance to the team. Has a strong sense of justice. Tactically astute and seldom lets emotions get in the way of his job. Has a sense of humour too. > Strengths: (keep them reasonable) Has the killer instinct and the guile to outmatch his opponents. Toys with the mind of his opponents and tends to finish a fight quick. > Weaknesses: His team-members who he considers a family. > Fears: (must have a fear.) Fear of his hidden past.
