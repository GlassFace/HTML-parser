[Personal Life Discussions] Are you a closet anime fan? - Page 2
 I wouldn't consider myself a person embarrassed to talk about anime, but I am not the type of guy to go around screaming, "Woooo Death Note. Light is so Badass!" While watching Death Note, my Mother accused me of watching Pokemon. "Stop watching pokemon!" Okay, all anime looks the same, right? People of the same ethnic background look the same right? Wow! Ignorance, I don't even know what to say. Anyway, although my family knows I am an anime enthusiast, they don't mind. Thanks for the responses, Jake
