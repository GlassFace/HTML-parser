[Anime] Sword Art Online To Air on Toonami in August
 Aniplex of America announced at its panel at Anime Boston on Friday that the Sword Art Online television anime series will air onAdult Swim's Toonami block starting this August. Aniplex of America also outlined its home video release of Sword Art Onlineon Blu-ray Disc and DVD, and its re-release of Blue Exorcist on DVD and for the first time, on Blu-ray Disc. http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news...ting-in-august Kirito's voice was really well done in the sub, and judging by this trailer hard to tell if it will be as good for an English dub version.

 This is awesome but I hope they don't wreck the voice dubs for the characters because the original has great voice acting 

 They tend to f*ck up the dub anyway

 ****, I almost cried watching the trailer thinking about the awesome ending. Anyway, I think the dub is pretty standard nothing too crazy but better than your average I guess. 
 Wow,Its hard to believe sword art online is going to be on Toonami.Otherwise,you really are right,kirito's english dub voice is sort of out of line due to his personality.

I'm already crying, they f*cked up Kirito's voice. The scene's just aren't going to be as epic and when ever the English does a scream it sounds forced...I mean even video games do a better scream then a dub Japanese anime. But I love that it's coming to Toonami, it deserves a spot there. I hope Toonami keeps up with it's popularity, soon enough more people will begin to like anime and anime will get the credit it deserves as well.

 It's really great that Toonami is getting some current anime that is pretty decent, and hopefully this means that we are going to get more current anime in the future. While I don't think SAO is the best anime around, I do think it is a good anime to start with, and it will most likely get more people into anime. And maybe one day we will see this same news for Fate/Zero, Psycho-Pass, or Attack on Titan.

 I'll be watching this just for the experience of hearing it in English, but as far as voice actors go Japanese voice actors > American voice actors. 
 lol another show I will be passing on toonami, I would prefer that they get something like Psycho Pass in their block. 
 Ahhhh, the nerd rage is glorious on a fresh bright morning. The guy they got for Kirito fits perfectly, far as I'm concerned. He sounds like a typical teenage boy, which he is. As for the choice of putting sao on Toonami, it's a really smart move- mmorpgs are huge right now, so a story about them is bound to pull in the viewers. Good choice, far as marketing goes. 

 Sigh oh great, so a POS anime will become even more well known, and getting yet more praise it doesn't deserve. Out of all the stuff that never gets sold in the US, they choose that, tsk tsk tsk. Looks like It's the Japanese fool the stupid americans holiday again(infact It's such an abomination to the written word, I bet it was really meant to just sell to the American masses to beginwith). What SAO teaches the industry, is quality doesn't matter, it can be the worst POS ever made, as long as the initial concept is good, people will put up with it, and praise it based on the concept, not on the actual show its self.

But the concept isn't even that original, I'm pretty sure the hack series does it all the time. It's actually a really classic concept- even before I played mmorpgs, I would read old novels about being trapped in games. The reason is keeps selling is probably because people would actually like it to happen to them- it would be nice for them to be released from the world they're in to live in their dream world. Whelp, that's just my theory though! *w*

Whelp, that's just my theory though! *w* While it wasn't a overly used concept until recently, yea lol It's not very original. Hell the west has been using such since the dawn of video games(which was before the Japanese even really had anything to do with the industry). However I'm not one to cry over originality, and frankly I couldn't care less(infact people that whine about something not being original, nomatter how good it is, usually piss me off), but this is an especially bad take at such, which only makes the WTF factor even bigger( as in WTF do people see in this POS, it has almost nothing going for it). 
 Yay! Another average anime being added to Toonami. IMO it is a great choice for Toonami, but eh.. not watching.
