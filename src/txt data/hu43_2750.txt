 90's kids and older, what do you miss the most? - Page 3
 I miss the era before social media, especially before smartphones, they ruined everything!!! (still I use it daily ) Forums were way more awesome in the mid 2000s, and gaming was something really social, you didn't sit alone in a room shouting like a retard into the dark. Also miss when playing was social, even when you were a teenager
