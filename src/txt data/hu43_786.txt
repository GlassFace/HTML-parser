[Comedy] Oreimo 2
 Second season of Oreimo. Not much to say, first episode is what you'd expect.

 Well I thought they were not going to continue from bringing Kirino back from America, I believe that was an OVA. But I guess I was wrong. I am really looking forward to this season and the progression between Kuroneko and Kyosuke. Even though I have seen it, I wanna see it in the Anime but hopefully they show Saori behind the glasses. 

 I havn't watched it yet. Will definately watch it when it ends though.

 I'm pretty impatient waiting for the second episode already :P This show is just really funny to me. 

 I'm really glad they made a second season. Now I can love Kuroneko even more!!! 
 I don't remember the brother being so pervy, I just thought he was helping his sister out...now he's more or less just pervy.

 I wasn't expecting a second season, but I liked the first so I will watch the second. I wonder how they will go about it due to the double ending in the first season..?

 I thought episode 2 was pretty funny. But an episode with Zero Kuroneko in it is almost meaningless to me...almost. 

 The second episode made me want to try out "Love Touch." If only such a game existed in our world. 
  Spoiler And this... Sums up the episode perfectly.

 New Episode...that Saori...loved it. The episode in General was kinda poor but Saori without glasses...*drool* 

 I'm not a big fan of Oreimo, mostly because I find Kirino to be annoying, but I liked that episode 3 focused on one of my favorite characters, Saori. Season 2 seems really disjointed so far but I hope we get more into Saori and other characters. If it's just going to be centered on Kirino then I'll probably drop it.

 Season 2 is boring so far. An extreme Lack of Kuroneko and mostly Kirino. It seems the creators know which direction they're moving in. Unfortunately it's the WRONG direction. 

 NOW WE MAY BE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. After watching episode 5 I've come to this, how can anyone like Kirino? She is a straight up B. Kyousuke was honest when he said she changed his life for the better and she goes on and smacks him. I'm so happy Kuroneko said "I wish she had a boyfriend" Because that opens up for Her to be with Kyousuke which is how the show should be. Also dide anyone else notice that Saori blushed a little when seeing those cosplay pics of Kyousuke...just saying another path the creators might take. But to go through that first half of Garbage with the date just to get Kuroneko in that white dress...cute and it was worth it. Episode five really got me. 

 wincest ending plz. I hope the LN writer doesn't pussy out.

 Kyousuke is a frigging idiot sometimes. And I hate hate hate Kirino. She only pretended to be this dudes girlfriend so Kyousuke had nothing to do with Saori and Kuroneko. (the two best girls in the show btw) Kuroneko though is the best and they drop that bomb at the end. As I was watching I'm going "I cannot believe they're going down this path right now, Kirino is a straight B" THEN THE BOMB BY KURONEKO AT THE END. If Kyousuke declines I may have to stop watching this show.

It's all tsundere, I can understand it from one, but from multiple characters, I felt myself saying I can't believe i watched the first season. Maybe I just have a bad memory and season 1 was as good as I had though. Anyway if Kyosuke doesn't go along with Kuroneko I will probably stop watching too, season 2 so far is a huge let down for me.

Hell I'd be Happy if He'd end up with Saori (but it'd be kinda weird) but I have an awful feeling they are going to go down the path of "Oh hey, Kyosuke ends up with no one and it's just "fun" times here with his sister Kirino." So Help me if that day happens. 

 I've been reading the manga some and it's even more annoying, the story telling is terrible only thing it has going for it is the wonderful drawings, but that isn't what interest me, I like good stories and the story of the manga isn't that good...I still really wonder about season 1 and how I sat myself though that...

I was reading some of the light novels, and apparently they're going to simultaneously release the last volume of the LN with the last episode of the anime so people can have a conclusion at the same time.  Spoiler I should have never read the LN. They always lead to spoilers 

 YES, the Kuroneko route begins... <3

 THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!!!!! A KURONEKO HEAVY EPISODE!!!! 10/10 I thought this episode was hilarious and really no flaws. 

 Win, freaking win! If the whole rest of season 2 is like this, it will top the first season.

As far as I can see, she's garbage as a person and I cannot understand why the series spends so much time praising her. She is just a really, really awful human being. Their parents must be horrible to not have a problem with her abusive behavior and I have no respect for Kyousuke for putting up with it. She's hitting her brother and throwing plates and everyone is okay with it? Sick family. I'd stopped watching after the fake boyfriend thing but if Kuroneko is going to be featured, I might check out a few more episodes.
