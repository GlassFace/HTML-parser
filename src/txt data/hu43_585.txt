 Fantasy Books - Page 4
 So, lately I've started to grow really interested in the fantasy genre. I read The Hobbit when I was a kid and really enjoyed it, but for some reason I never really read fantasy again until recently. Here are the ones I've read so far: *The Hobbit *Lord of the Rings *Mistborn (all three) *A Song of Ice and Fire (all five) *The Way of Kings (probably the best book I've read yet) *A couple of others I'm forgetting So, what are some of your favorite fantasy books? I'm looking for more to read, and right now I'm seriously considering Wheel of Time. Oh, quick note although I don't think it's necessary: I'm not interested in Harry Potter, Eragon, Twilight, or anything else that's shitty.
