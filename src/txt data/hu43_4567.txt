[Anime] "Romance Anime" - Page 2

It's either focused on separate people to develop characters, or it's focused on the relationships and problems of all the characters. Yet, people still say it's one of the best romances of all time. Even though it's a great show, you saying that Angel Beats isn't a romance would be saying that Clannad isn't a romance. Clannad focuses on drama while Angel Beats focuses more on action. I say that all the time about Clannad, but it usually starts a fight sigh. It annoys the hell out of me, when people call it a romance anime, seriously if It's suppose to be a Romance anime, It's the worst romance anime ever made, because well, there is no romance lol.

 Originally Posted by wesleyv1 Your just gonna forget all about ushio aren't you? There's next to no romance in the entire series. I can only think of 1 scene in the entire series that would count as romantic. Also no, just because a child comes to being, doesn't make such a romance series. It's a drama/slice of life anime, a pretty awesome one granted, but in no way, shape or form, is it a romance anime.

It's not a Romance-genre focused anime, as the topic is discussing. You and I both know there was more than a love story to the plot, which skimmed the romantic development between the characters for most of the story until the last few episodes. The romantic themes were actually bare, what is this "had tons of romantic themes throughout the whole freaking show" you speak of? 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils?

Its all about what your interpretation is. Thats not wrong or right. Its what you took out of it. Originally Posted by kirito1 well said dude Thanks

You take away what you want to from the experience. There's no taking romance from Clannad, and After Story, because there has to be some romance to beginwith for you to get that from it. It's like calling a anime, where someone punches a wall(nothing else throughout the series), a action anime lmao. It is fact, such is not a action anime, just like It's fact, Clannad+After Story "is not" a romance anime.

 Hey dude. I don't go around knocking inyuasha so just drop it. You're not convincing anyone but yourself

 I felt like Fruits Basket was a romance anime, and a bit of a reverse harem; but still, the proper for the genre. I was pretty sad in ep one with the tent thing and all, but it was a good story.

The pink haired girl and the secondary male character (I haven't seen Angel Beats in ages). These two characters have a huge romantic relationship which has development for around 2 episodes (considering Angel beats is also only 13 episodes). On top of that, the main characters puts most of his time towards the one female "Angel" throughout the entire show. Putting attention towards a female from someone of the opposite gender sounds like romance doesn't it? I don't understand how you would think the themes were bare? You say it doesn't develop any romance "until the last few episodes" but that isn't true at all since the whole plot is focused on this "Angel" girl right from the get go.

 I can't stand people that can't differentiate between genres. I bet the people calling Clannad a Romance anime, are the same people who call Action/Adventure games, RPGs sigh. It really annoys the hell out of me.

No, the relationship was not huge. It was not the focus of the plot, it was a side effect of the circumstances which led to the fulfillment of the characters. It was a really sweet and feel-good subplot, and nothing more. We don't need mathematical proportions to cement the romantic measurements of the anime, they aren't even valid reasoning. Any romantic progression with PROVABLE SUBSTANCE and CLEARLY APPARENT FEELINGS/EMOTIONS/AFFECTION in the MAIN PLOT all occurred around the last few episodes. Even though the MC did commit his attention to understanding Angel starting from the first episode, that doesn't mean he proclaimed his solid affection or love for her from episode one. It took some time before he actually acknowledged that he was in love with the girl, done so in a fashion where action-comedy took most of the spot-light for a vast majority of the MAIN PLOT. The anime was now ALL about creating situations for Angel and the MC to connect or bond more to each other and have forge an intimate friendship, all the small scenes added up to the resolution where things were made clear...in a pretty fleeting moment as well for a conclusion if I say so myself. Do you get my argument at least? Romance anime are centered around the two characters. angel Beats was an action-comedy anime that delved into romantic themes, but lightly and softly enough that they didn't become a part of the MAIN plot.

Your argument isn't wrong that romance isn't a part of the main plot, which I agree with; however, you're saying that if an anime doesn't include a theme or motif in the main plot then these themes are null and void when deciding on the genre of an anime. This isn't true because shows like Durarara, Clannad, and Sword Art Online are all considered romances even though their MAIN PLOTS (like you said) don't really have any romance in them. Yes Angel Beats doesn't necessarily have any romance in its main plot. However, it has tons of specific moments in the show where romantic communication occurs. Specific shows have been known to dive into multiple genres. Clannad isn't MAINLY a romance because romance isn't a part of its main plot (similarly like what you were saying about Angel Beats). But, Clannad is still a romance in the regards that it pursued a romantic relationship. The same goes for Angel Beats.

 You're categorizing the whole based on a few of its parts, that's not how things should be filed. Angel Beats had romantic themes, but is not a Romance genre anime. You're basically saying that Kaichou Wa Maid Sama and Angel Beats are mostly the same thing, when they're obviously not as one is a Comedy-Action anime while the other is a purely Romantic-Comedy anime.

 Excuse me if I missed something here but I think the purpose of this thread was to get recommendations for romance animes, not to start a flame war.

You're basically saying that Kaichou Wa Maid Sama and Angel Beats are mostly the same thing, when they're obviously not as one is a Comedy-Action anime while the other is a purely Romantic-Comedy anime. Did you read one word I even said? All I'm freaking saying is that Angel beats has a part in the romantic genre just like other shows like Clannad, SAO, Durarara, and As you said Kaichou Wa Maid Sama. They all touch romantic themes, some stronger then others. Just because a show doesn't focus on a genre completely doesn't mean that genre isn't present. Yes Angel Beats isn't a freaking romantic story; however, it's a romance show because 2 pairs of characters pursue each other in a romantic relationship. I'm simply saying it touches the romance genre, and is a part of it. I don't even understand your argument. You're saying all shows with romantic themes can only be considered a romance if it only focues on romance and drops the focus on other moods and genres such as action or thriller for example. Also how am I basically saying that Kaichou Wa Maid Sama and Angel beats are the same. You literally just write claims down on a post saying i'm wrong without even reading what I'm saying. You just come out of no where in the first place, saying that the fact that I think Angel Beats is in the romance genre is absurd. That if I add another genre to it's list of genres its like I'm an idiot. Not only that but you start an argument based on opinion. You don't even give any support for your thoughts you just make claims that completely contradict my own. This is all just so stupid and I don't see how someone can be so stupid and ignorant.

 Flame war? Hardly.  Spoiler How about you calm down and stop embarrassing yourself? You're claiming that I don't listen to you, when I just summarized the first half of your rant as "You're categorizing the whole thing based off of its parts". That is literally what you're explaining to me. A part of the anime had romance, therefore it should be considered as a romance genre. This thread is asking for specific, entirely romance-centric anime...which Angel Beats is not. I'm arguing that an anime is a pure (now I've said that word before as well do you remember? It means ENTIRELY, COMPLETELY.) romance if it does in fact do what you said, drop a lot of the other themes or keep them minimal as it focuses on the love story (like most Shoujo anime or manga). I used Maid-sama because that's exactly what it is, a pure example of a romance anime. All loves story, with comedy and snapshots of other genres thrown in to keep things interesting. Angel Beats, which is not a complete romance love-story, is not like Maid-sama at all. Yet you argue that because both have a love-story mentioned in them, they're both thrust into the category of romances (which I assumed were the pure ones that this thread's subject was about). In actuality, you're the one putting words in other people's mouths here. I was using an example and defending my claim, yet you act the victim and make me out to be some type of belligerent d-bag who's used words that haven't even been mentioned by me, but instead were just personal assumptions made by you! Welcome to A4, arguments happen all the time. This one was pretty civil as well, and still is as long as you don't blow a gasket again because of your mistakes. This whole time I've been providing valid reasoning on the subject, are you just accusing me of any shred of unsatisfactory things you can think of as you typed your rant up? It really sounds like it, because most of your rant hasn't been valid at all. You want out? Slide on by bruv, I'm cool with it. Some just can't handle my swag.
