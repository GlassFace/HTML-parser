 Which Videogame Universe Would you Like To Live In?
 Lets use our imaginations guys, lol. If you could pick any universe from gaming, which world would you pick to live in. What about that world attracts you? What would you want to be in that world? I have two universes that i would like to live in. One is Resident Evil, because i wouldn't mind being an agent traveling the world and killing Zombies. I would like to save people from the Zombie Apocalypse. I know my life will be lived on the edge, but it would be thrilling, lol. The other world i would pick is The Legend of Zelda because of the society and environment. The world is beautiful and the landscapes are awesome. I would most likely be an Elf like Link. Also adventures would be apart of my daily routine. There might not be a boring day ever in this world. So those are two of my worlds i would like to live in. What are yours? And why?
