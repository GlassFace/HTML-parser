 New, New, New!!!
 Hello EVERYONE!!! This is my first anime forum ever. I'm still very new to anime (picked it up about 2 years ago) and so I was hoping by joining an anime forum place I would learn to love anime even more. As stated above I'm a noob in this area so I hope you guys can forgive me slowness, so if you could give me any pointers (and recommendations since I have so many anime to watch and can be overwhelming on where to start) I would greatly appreciate it. I'm just that one random Asian dude who is a lost sheep, so guide me oh great people of this place and let us become great friends.
