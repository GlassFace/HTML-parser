Whether it's a short story or not, this can be expanded upon and has great potential. But on the science side, most murders kill for pleasure and it's something wrong with the brain. I would love you to expand in detail this aspect because seeing beautiful scenery isn't enough to change someones mind. But you've included a psychological aspect which forces the person to witness his own mistake over and over again. I want to know more about how you got the guy to become good is what I'm asking. I'm also going to ask if you'd want any help or a partner in this idea because many of my stories involve stuff like this. Read the Science Fiction one. I have other works and that one was written back in '09. Well if you ever want to bounce some ideas off each other feel free to private or visitor message me. Oh, also I didn't see any grammatical errors and the flow was perfect. I see someone here can't take a joke... don't get mad especially if it's not your thread.
