 Ah! My Goddess.
 How did it come to this? I just started watching the first season about two or three days ago, and now it's over. People say there are no hopes for a third season, some say there are chances. I can't stop thinking about the third season, and it's really bugging me. No matter what, I can't get the image of a third season out of my head! Anyway, both seasons were great! I just wish that there was more, btw! I think there are only twenty two episodes, but is there two more? I could only find dubbed ones and dubbed anime is not my slice of cheese. Ugh, at times.. Â Spoiler Well maybe I could enjoy the cruise back to Alabama. *Long story short* I won a BMX race and won a free trip on a small cruise ship to Hawaii. (It was awful.) But since I'm straying off the topic, I'm going to skip this. If anyone has information on the third season, please, post it in the comments. I really can't get my mind of of it. I would even like suggestions, don't ask me what I watched already! There is a freaking site that tells you, I'm not going to even attempt to copy that stuff down on an iPad.
