[Adventure] Ixion Saga DT
 The game and anime follow Kon Hokaze, a boy who embarks on a journey from our world to an alternate world known as Mira, which is full a mysterious energy known as Alma. After saving Princess Ecarlate from attackers, he soon finds himself in the middle of a struggle around Alma. Well looks can be deceiving, I took a look into this anime and I actually like it. The bad guy at the end being K.O. was the best part, I mean having a spiked shoe is one thing... Anyway I am looking forward to the next episode.

 Oh god, the villein from the last episode lost one, became lopsided and then got nailed by a hammer and most likely lost the other. I feel so bad for him. Besides that a good episode.

 The first episode was pretty dumb/crappy until the end, then in one move it mocked horrible animes like DBZ like no other(making fun of the whole charging up thing), which was just awesome. Also the part in the shoe shop was pretty funny too. 
 lol.... I fell behind a bit on this series and am just catching up again. I forgot just how funny this show is! Sometimes I can't contain my laughter. It's.... Fullmetal! rofl I guess because I watch Gintama, I'm used to balls gags.

 If so what are your thoughts? I personally like it, but I feel like it's a show that not a lot of people will like.

 I saw the first ep, and not impressed one bit, the show doesn't take its self seriously. However the best part of the ep, was near the end, when it downright made fun of DBZ, and any other crappy anime, where the char do nothing but trash talk/take forever to charge up their special attacks). I was planning to watch a few more episodes, before deciding to drop it or not, but I haven't got around to it yet.

It's a bit of a satire show though, so the seriousness of it I don't think was supposed to be too high in the first place. I've seen episodes where they made fun of lots of other anime.

 Of course im watching Ixion Saga DT! Its so awesome anime im only sad it isnt so popular. Kon and Erec make the anime so awesome , hilarious ... and Erec's teams (team of weirdos). I love parodies and this one is really worth to watch maybe few episodes were disappointing but i enjoy watching it. 
 
 Plus everyones tastes are different. Like I said, I really like it, but it has that feel like there's probably a lot of haters...

 I dont really care what people hate or like , what count most for me is if i enjoy watching an anime. I know people who were recommending such stupid shows i didnt said anything to them since i knew they were crap so if people say about this anime its bad i will still watch it since i love comedy/parodies. Beside if you liked Ixion Saga Dt you may like too Hayate no Gotoku. 
 
 Funny you'd mention that. Hayate no Gotoku is actually another one of the shows i'm watching, and yes I love it. Glad to find someone with a good sense of humor. I also heard Gintama is a lot like that, though i've only watched like, the first episode.

 Well Hayate start bit stupid and half episodes in season 1 were so random but i enjoyed that stuff to watch and season 2 was just amazing. But im not a big fan of season 3 , Gintama i saw it to episode 200 then i lost interest in it maybe i will watch it later and yeah its also amazing.

 "I remain un-violated" best line in this entire show. This show is just stupid random but funny as hell. It's great.

 I like all the references to other works, especially the Sailor Moon one.

 Looks like this anime will be getting a second season...not say I'm a fan of the new look for both the main character--DT--and the grown up princess...too big of boobs on her. So with that being said the season end is what you'd expect...over the top crazy, such as the trany guy giving his balls to what's his face...the show isn't good enough for me to remember their names but still wtf. Over all a decent anime that I can stand watching and will stand watching the second season.

 Im voting for Ixion so he can get a season 2 , the story well the story is random but awesome parody with very original characters. I enjoyed watching all episodes and KON is cool 
 
 I totally want that second season.
