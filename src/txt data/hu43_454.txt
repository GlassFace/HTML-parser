 http://www.pinterest.com/characterdesigh/ If you don't have a Pinterest account, I highly recommend getting one. There are a lot of good drawings/paintings/tutorials on that site.

This site saved me a lot of time when I was in college. http://www.youtube.com/user/KienanLa...ature=playlist Good and informative in his process in his CG paintings. I learned quite a few things from him. He also works for Riot.
