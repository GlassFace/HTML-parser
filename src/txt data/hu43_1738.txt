 A4 Wallpaper Thread.
 Heya~ Thought it was fun to have an A4 wallpaper thread. Shikinami and I will create like two A4 wallpapers a week, just for A4 users. You can suggest what anime you want a wallpaper from and we will see if we can make one. Resolutions: 1680x1050 Wallpapers for now: http://i.imgur.com/II9WQiS.jpg http://i.imgur.com/HiAezpd.jpg http://i.imgur.com/ZuAhCHJ.jpg http://i.imgur.com/1VF6b3y.jpg http://i.imgur.com/iQxyhy8.jpg http://i.imgur.com/4XX55sH.jpg

 Pretty snazzy Tak. Did you come up with the background or was it part of the original? Surprised there isn't more hype around the show to be honest.

Made it myself actually. Yeah, the show looks pretty interesting. I'm sure there will be more hype around its release date to be honest.
