[Fantasy] Kyoukai no Kanata (Beyond the Boundary)
 AHHHHHH DAMN!!!! WHAT AN ENDING!!! Talk about cliff hanger. The episode did a complete 180 going from pretty funny to pretty serious. Also that Giraffe animal Cracker...aka...well hopefully people got that reference. Â Spoiler The preview for next weeks episode looks sick! I cannot wait
