[General Discussion] Do you buy/use second hand things?
 Lately, Ive been buying second hand clothing. I get them like $4 for a top and $5 ~ $6 for a skirt and $9 for a whole dress. That is cheap. My mom hates it though, she is outraged/mad and says she feels pity for me. She keeps saying, those clothes probably have cancer or some disease in them that I can pick up. You? What do you get second hand? 
 Video games mainly, but I do get old clothing from my sister's husband. Also what your mom said, she's crazy, if you actually buy the stuff from a store put the clothing though the wash before selling it.

 I prefer everything new if possible. I only buy used things when the price of new is ridiculously high. The only used things that I have ever bought so far have been textbooks and console game discs.

 Clothes, if I find ones I like that fit, video games, CD's, books, DVD's, and sometimes collectibles. Almost anything can be sold second hand and as long as it was decently taken care of, it will be of great use to someone else. Nothing wrong with it. Hell, that's what yard sales are for. Getting rid of stuff you don't want or use at low prices.

 Records, instruments, books, comics. Rarely clothing though. 

 by second hand you mean generic or used right in that case i buy most of my video games that way because i didnt get like 250 video games from buying top dollar stuff. i also buy cheap socks because im not spending 14 bucks for some nba socks like alot of people do it's a stupid idea.

 I've worn some of my sisters old clothes but thats cause she has good style and i know where it's coming from but yeah i have gotten use clothes before,only when they look new or well kept otherwise i dont get it and i dont always get it. just when i really like it 
 Gently used games maybe but nothing other than that. I don't spend tons of money anyways so when I do, I prefer to buy newer stuff. :3 Btw, my mother used to say pawn shop goods were taken off dead people and then sold..that's why they're so cheap. She was intentionally exaggerating/joking though. XD

 Usually instruments, books, and accessories. Furniture is also wonderful to get second-hand as long as it's not a mattress. 
Currently listening to: SULK - End Time I wanna fade out. 
 usually its clothes or shoes. If its something good and not too expensive , then yes. I like new clothes but mostly its very expensive, unless I go to some shops where they have some clothes that is cheaper. I don't like spending my money on expensive things because I know I cannot afford it. Books. In high school I was buying school books that were used. The new ones were extremely expensive and they were not worth of the price. For some weird reason I value books more than clothes. So, if a book is valuable and is used/new I wouldn't care for the price. 
 Ok you guys, no you can't get cancer from second hand clothes, and I better not see another post about it. Jesus.

 If clothes will give you cancer, then they would not resell them... I usually don't but second hand anything because even with the store employees telling me it's just as good as the new one, I can never be too sure. I did play a second hand tuba during high school because I could not afford my own. The part I actually own, the mouth piece, both of mine are second hand as well (and thoroughly washed before I used them)

 I deleted them because you are spreading lies. You cannot "catch" cancers. they aren't communicable diseases. If you understood the etiology behind them you would know why. Now you can catch a virus or bacteria that might cause cancer, but the odds of that happening because of used clothing are low. I'm talking super low, like not even worth thinking about. Youre more likely to get an STD from your dog.

 Yeah, Clothes, parts for computers, DVD's, old consoles, etc, I don't have the money to afford the super duper brand new stuff nowadays and I'm not trying to impress anyone anyways, so it's worth it. 
 I don't buy expensive clothes anyway. I shop on the high street, so when it comes to clothes, no. If I am looking for a costume for a musical, then I might search the charity shops. But I do give clothes I no longer want to charity, on the other end of it. As for cancer, the only link between the two is the money that you pay if buying from the cancer research foundation shops.

 If I get anything that's used it'll either be games or college textbooks, I've never wore or bought used clothing, and I don't plan on starting to. 
 You can't get cancer from used clothes. That said clothes at Wal-Mart brand new aren't that much more expensive than used ones. Used baby clothes are big business because they grow so fast so people trade them in for other used ones all the time. There's a business model built around it. 
 I am a thrift store maniac! Most of what I own is second hand with the exception of my bed, shoes and underwear and the like. I end up making a lot of my own clothes and jewelry too. I don't see a problem with it, and really, I can't stand most newer fashions, so I buy a lot of vintage clothing and jeans that predate the stupid "skinny" trend. My favorite is the bins. It is piles of clothes, books, housewares etc. that you can flail through, and It's all like $1 a pound. I have met people that make a living online as "personal shoppers". They have rich oversees clients that pay them bank to procure vintage american fashions. Most of it comes from the bins. Hilarious. Second hand clothes (if properly laundered) are totally harmless. I used to be afraid of thrift store goods when I was a kid. I went to a Goodwill when I was around 8 years old, and saw all of these gulf war army fatigues. There was lot of media hype about Gulf War Syndrome at the time, and I was afraid that these thrift store goods might be contaminated with it. Soooo dumb of me. I'm glad that I got over it in my teen years and discovered how cool thrift and consignment shops can be.

 I only get second hand books, the rest I buy it new. Like Shannon, I do give to charity the clothes I don't want anymore. I'm a serious shoppaholic, so the clothes I give are virtually new (some are... really NEW, even have the tags) :P

 I got brain cancer just reading some of these posts. There is nothing wrong with second hand stuff as long as it's able to be sanitary condition. Clothes are fine in my opinion, and I frequently shop at places like Good will when I have some shenannigan projects I want to finish.

There's that dress maybe in the wardrobe that I'll never wear, but don't wanna give away just yet, but I know I will eventually.

 I love second hand. Living in a mostly country area, big shopping centers aren't exactly common to come across and the selection isn't... great. Second hand is nice though. I buy lots of things second hand. Haven't so much clothes yet. But I do whenever I find a nice item. Used university textbooks, books, teacups. I'm fond of vintage items and yard sales. I love dishware particularly.
