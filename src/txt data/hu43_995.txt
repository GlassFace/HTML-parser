 Classic Pokemon: The First movie. I still remember crying when pikachu cried *Dont judge* haha Fairy tail movie. Not as good as the series and Naruto: blood prison 
 First Pokemon movie, no question about it. 
 The Rebuild of Evangelion movies are really good. Especially 2.0.

 metropolis, lupin the 3rd and the castle of cagleostro, studio ghibli films 
 I have only watched three anime movies Spirited Away and both Afro Samurai movies. 

 It's not a complete series yet, but Mardock Scramble is really good. (3 Parts, 2 out) 
 My favorite is Spirited Away at the moment, but most movies studio ghibli are are in my favorite. I liked both eden of the east movies, but the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya is my favorite movie based on the anime.
