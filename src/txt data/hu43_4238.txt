 RIP Charles H Towns
 http://www.washingtonpost.com/nation...prss=rss_local The father of all modern electronics died on the 27th at age 99. Even though he shared a nobel physics prize you probably don't know his name. He's one of the many people who worked on the front lines of physics but when it came right down to it his premier invention wasn't the popular one. That being said, however, without his invention, known as the maser, the popular and ground breaking laser would never have been invented, and I couldn't begin to count how many things we would not have today had those never been invented. Thank you Mr. Towns for creating that which makes life that much easier.
