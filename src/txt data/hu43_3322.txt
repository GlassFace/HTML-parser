[Personal Life Discussions] What skill/talent do you wish you had
 I'm trying to learn Japanese. I tried Korean, and it's far easier than Japanese. I can write Korean with ease, and speaking it is nothing, but putting things in context is insane. The same thing goes for Japanese, but a million times harder. My god, it's hard. Multiple alphabets don't bring me any peace at night Other than those, though, I'd love the ability to play every instrument
