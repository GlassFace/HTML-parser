 Yo!
 Hey! Well hello minna!! My name is Nia and I have a full on otaku and I ADORE anime!! It's like my life tbh. When my ships die, I die with my ships(grades included). Let me say that Anime is the reason I LIVE why I go to school, and why I get up in the morning(which should be saying somethingxD) Anyways.... Nice to be involved with other otakus and be able to talk to other people inside my own fandoms, since I live in Canada it's hard to find a nice otaku, ANYWHO Nice to meet you all and I hope I make tons of cool friends!! Peace 
 Welcome to A4 Nia~! I'm Taka pleased to meet you! And I can reason with you, I do agree. No Anime No Laifu~ =D Can you tell more about yourself?

 I have to point out the naivety of sacrificing your grades for a hobby of staring at a screen.
