 TPP Twitter Storm and petitions
 Hello and greetings my friends! I just want to let you know of two things. First is of the President Obamas Address to the people concerning the TPP (Trans Pacific Partnership) agreement and the second is to inform you of the massive twitter storm many of us have planned that will take place during the address. This will be Jan 28. I cannot seem to find the exact time but I will be on from basically when I get off work until I have to go to bed. Object is simple. It is to make noise. Sign the petitions at http://www.stopfasttrack.com/ Call your local government office, Senators, Governors. We must make them understand that this so called trade deal is a VERY bad idea! You can check it out on Wikileaks or heck. Type in Youtube why is tpp bad and you will get some basic information from that as well. It will cause untold damage to the environment, Organic food businesses around the world. The Intellectual Propriety Section is essentially Sopa, Pipa, Cispa and the other horrific bills the world said NO too time and time again and since its part of this Trade agreement that is being fast Tracked past congress and held in "secret" so that even the media cannot tell you whats on it until its already the law of the land. We have no say. But thanks to the leaked documents we can see how horrific it is and even if I only get one person here to stand with me and the millions of others who are against this world wide. I will have considered this post successful. Every aspect of this is bad for the whole world as it will make generic medicine harder to come by. It will lessen food quality and harm the Organic food industry. It will force SOPA and CISPA laws onto the internet world wide and no amount of protesting or corporate protest will ever fix it. Not to mention that any country that refused to "allow" the United states or any other country to do fracking in their country can be sued which is completely unforgivable. I am not exaggerating and not making any part of this up. Read the wikileaks, Check the videos and the Protests about the TPP. This is a serious problem and every single individual voice counts towards the growing voice of NO TPP. Even if you do not have a Twitter account. Simply signing any of the petitions. Such as the one provided or the ones by EFF or other organizations adds up.

 Twitter storm? Why? If people really want to change something, do it the way that really matters just a bit more. Tell people to go to https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/ and open a petition or something. It would probably be better than flooding Twitter's servers if they wanted to do something virtually. Else, gather said millions of people and have them actually storm the presidential offices of the necessary leaders and force them to stop it.

Petition the whitehouse, ohh god what a hilarious thought. Months later we're still waiting on a response to the petition pardoning Edward Snowden, it's OK the president was kind enough to share his beer recipe with us! 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them.

Did that petition get enough votes in time? Anyway, it is certainly still better than spamming Twitter.

Protests that cost protesters nothing fail overwhelmingly often. I don't know if anything has ever been accomplished by online protests using whitehouse.gov or Twitter. 
 I have this rule of thumb where if something has broad, bipartisan support among our politicians it's probably terrible for the American people. I'm curious to see how this one plays out. I bet everyone in congress celebrates it. It's basically a way for our corps to continue to exert dominance across the world (I think we've done well enough with orgs like the IMF for example, but loans to Greece seemed to piss people off here). Also notable is the absence of China from the agreement. I expect they'll want in as soon as they figure out US corps will send even more jobs their way. And to keep the US from having too much influence if we do join.

Actually you would be very surprised at how well it can work. True there are a plethora of Issues regarding many things that get petitioned online but when it comes to something big, and I mean really,really big. Things like Sopa for a big example. Internet Social Sites being stormed are a great way to spread awareness and physical activism. Furthermore, there are a few Petitions that do a great deal of good, Simply because; People like the EFF are extremely popular and have a good deal of influence in courts and politics. More Signatures adds to the weight of their argument when they show up in person. Many people whom have not heard about it previously, discover it through things like this and when they discover it because the media did not cover it or only made small mentions of it. They get angry and join in on those with the physical protests. So don't always discount these as a failure waiting to happen. Because with enough people, enough signatures, enough awareness and physical activism. Everything all adds up to a singular purpose and without the weight of all the others. It will have significantly less strength.

 I tend to think SOPA only worked out because enough of our tech sector was against it in a serious way. It basically made hosting and service providers responsible to the movie and recording industry for copyright infringement. Here, it'll be hard to see what corps are really against the TPP (so they'll all throw money at congress to push it through). The only hope of this not passing is the congress is still fuming over Obamacare and won't sign onto anything he presents (which seems likely enough actually). Or enough people up for election this fall feel like it will screw them.

 If this is true they're going to do this, it's bad, and we're petitioning it ...... i'm sorry but this petition is going to be value as much as a not saying " THIZS BAD " 
 Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide. *Bill The Butcher - Gangs Of New York* 
 This TPP issue was hinted at in the state of the union, as expected. It's interesting Obama phrased it as a way to open up new markets to "made in America" goods. I've worked with quite a few small businesses in my professional career (and some $50 million dollar in revenue "small businesses"). I can say that there are American manufacturers out here and some are selling to China. I've also seen the reverse with companies dedicated to the distribution of foreign manufactured goods (employing teams of sales people here). It seems like to really do well, most small businesses that are killing it have teams of sales people (typically run by the owners) who can really hussle (even if they do a lot of e-commerce). Opening borders isn't really enough, the same way that lowering taxes isn't enough. The people who have been making it have been chasing sales well, regardless of their political affiliation. I'd really like it if politicians understood for once what it took to do business and figured out how to get more people doing business and didn't fill their minds with all kinds of ideological garbage. Then maybe they wouldn't rush into deals hand-crafted by the biggest dogs on the block.
