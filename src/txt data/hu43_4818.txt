 What are your top five favorite games
 They can be over any platform or device, such as Xbox, Playstation, DS etc.. It's hard for me to pick but if I had to, I'd say my list goes like this... 1st- Fallout 3 2nd- Pokemon Emerald 3rd- Dark Souls 4th- Borderlands 2 5th- Dead Space There are a few other games that come close to grabbing a spot in my top 5, but I would have to go with this list overall.
