[Action] Samurai Flamenco
 Yay, more superheroes! <3 I don't read many western comics with superheroes, but for some reason I just love the Japanese ones... Original anime scheduled to run on noitaminA for 2 cours. The anime's taglines read, "To those 'adults' who don't want to become adults..." and "Hero will never give up, never hide, never be defeated, never accept evil."
