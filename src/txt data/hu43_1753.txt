 What's a song that puts you to sleep?
 So I can't fall asleep, and my body is sore as hell from falling yesterday, And I needed something to post, So I have to ask, whats a song that can put you to sleep easily? I'm awfully curious as to what answers I will receive.. 
 knife party? No but seriously, after random clicking through my music, i found this:  Spoiler relocation - feed me mon cherie, ma cherie - infinite stratos (i could probably sleep with this playing) eclair wo mondemiyou - dog days (taketatsu ayana um, talking... does anybody have this?) OVER - (to aru index) miracle of endymion (especially the La La La bit, their signing makes me sleepy) most Keane and Magnetic Man songs make me tired for some reason song of time - gedo senki (teshima aoi) carrying you - laputa (in fact i think most of the ghibli songs make me fall asleep at the ending) any kind of low key trance music would make you feel tired after a while Yet it depends on the situation... 
My Anime List Picture Library Dragon Kung Fu Wing Chun
 All songs with lyrics that I can understand, especially ones about love, will put me to sleep.

 It doesn't put me to sleep but avril lavines so much for my happy ending will literally put me in a fog

 For me it's my most precious treasure from the anime angel beats, it's a very calming song so it will definitely help you, but not completely.

 The only songs that make me sleepy are the ones that make me close my eyes to listen to them. Such as: 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 Going to have to go with this rendition of Silence before the Storm.  Spoiler

 Aqueous Transmission by Incubus. That eargasmic song is too relaxing for me. Especially the last 30 second part with all the crickets and frogs in the background -_-

 The only song I know that'll put me to sleep is fix you by Coldplay. it's a very calm song 

 Iso-tones.com It uses isochronic tones which set your brain waves into different states. the website has not only sleeping stuff but also tones that make you more energetic and such. I would suggest going to recreational tones and finding the Dreamy or float or sleep tones 
 I dont listen to boring music.Mine is fast/jumpy.But even though I likr sleeping with music, it doesnt make me sleepy. Even if it is a sloe gentle instrumental

 Try Elfen Lied- Lilium (music box) Extended, This should do the trick it is soothing.
