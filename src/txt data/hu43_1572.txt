[Adventure] Pokemon Origins
 I've watched it over the course of a few days and it was really good. So Â Spoiler Charizard X appears at the end of the last episode to kick some Mewtwo butt , who cares. This is really just a bit of fanservice to celebrate X/Y's release. It was a great idea and a great watch. Don't need anything else. Next step: release of the games!
