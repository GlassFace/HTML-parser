[General Discussion] Things that you hate but nobody else seems to (Pet peeves)
 I think we all have a couple of things that get to us specifically, but the vast majority of people don't mind at all. What are a couple of yours? For the sake of this thread, I would like to remind people that these are things that bother you specifically, or at least bother you more than they should. They are not things that just about everybody dislikes. These are bad answers: "I hate it when people eat with their mouths open!" "I hate the sound of nails on a chalkboard!" "I hate mosquitoes!" We all hate everything above. Try to come up with a unique answer of a way in which you are petty. 
 
 Ever gone to a baseball game and try to order a hotdog? You know how they pass your food down the row and everyone you don't know touches it? Yeah, that kind of stuff bugs the hell out of me.

 When I'm the first to arrive at class and about to tap my card onto the card-based attendance machine, but somebody who comes a bit later beats me to it. When I see a drawer or locker's door left open or not closed firmly. When someone dog-ears book pages. When 2 people share one ice-cream cone. 

 O_O Really Tenken? They do that??? Mine would be: People who smoke in public. Drunk people in public. People without shoes... (Why the **** don't you wear shoes, we all know you have some at home...) Sluts. When people sit in the seat I usually sit in. When the jungler ganks my lane without me telling them to. The fact that SNSD wins 1st by default in everything. @Rafee, What's worse is when they dog ear YOUR book with their stupid fat elbows...

Yeah, that kind of stuff bugs the hell out of me. Ugh, yeah. That's absolutely unsanitary but a lot of people don't pay it much mind. @Raffee Those are all good examples. I love the dog earring book pages one. It's so petty but I can imagine someone glaring with fury at a confused classmate. Anyway, mine is the sound of people drinking. Even if it's across the room, the glug glug glug sound makes me shudder. I need a little stress ball to squeeze when they do that. 
 Smoking related annoyances: - I hate being alone or being the only smoker in an area, having a cigarette but no light. Like one time my lighter stopped working. It was below zero outside and my lighter just stopped. I stood here in the snow and cold for about 5 minutes trying to pour hand sanitizer in there so some of the sparks would maybe catch fire. - Being at home, not being able to find a lighter, using a gas stove to light a cigarette and accidentally burning your hair. Computer Related: - playing a game and suddenly experiencing dial up like lag, lag ending and only to find you're dead. - despite using the internet and having a wealth of material at your disposal still there are stupid people using the internet. HOW THE **** DID THAT HAPPEN?! It's not like we have to go all the way to a library, using the reference catalog and then research something to know even a nil about it. Miscellaneous: - I am not a neat freak. But as someone who has lived with other people... I like that every item has its own place. I absolutely hate feeling like I lost something because someone else came around and moved it. Why the hell do you take items from a medicine cabinet and put them in your bedroom drawer? Or why did you come into my room to take my keys and then not put them back? - grocery shopping. I don't believe the customer is always right. But the customer has rights. You decided to put an auto lock feature on the shopping cart and now the damn thing won't bring me to my car. You expect me to carry all those bags about half a football field away because you had a problem with people stealing carts? And then when I ask you to carry them to my car you look offended? "It's not in my job description." Bullshit. When I chose to shop at your establishment no where did it say "due to overcrowding, you may have a shitty parking spot and may not be able to push your cart to your car." - going shopping and somehow forgetting the most important thing on the list that is absolutely necessary for the evening meal. (or the store not having it.) How does a meat market run out of turkey? If it was in November I'd understand. But the middle of August?

 When people use incorrect English like "I should of" in writing. Annoys hell of me (now they are going to do it more around here.) The dog earing book one is interesting. My mom reads many of my novels... and especially when I buy one and she reads it first, it's like "stop turning down the ****ing pages, use a bookmark" lol. Doesn't bother me unless it's MY books. lol. Smoking, especially women doing it. It irritates me. Like my sister smokes like a chimney, and the way she'll sit outside dragging on a cigarette like her life depends on it, grrrr. That shouldn't annoy me as much as it does. (EDIT: lol that was pure co-incidence Chicanary, you posted while I was typing)

 The sound certain vacuum cleaners make. There's just certain pitches that will drive me completely to rage. It probably sounds dumb and I don't think most people even notice them aside from the fact that they're on or off, but good god certain vacuums are aggravating to me. 

 I can't stand purple shoes. I go completely blind when I see shoes that are completely purple with no supportive colors. 
 When people are smacking their mouths while eating, and talking to me at the same time. I'm not over exaggerating at all when I say it took ALL of my strength to not attack my mother one time after I had just woken up in a trance. I literally wanted to murder her. Then one time when I hadn't just woken up my dad did it and I just wanted to beat his face in, but I always want to do that to him to some degree. ---------- Also, 5 dollars on Shannon. 
 Coke. I've never had it and never want to, the smell puts me off entirely. I tell people that i've never had coke out of choice and they just don't believe me. Urg, even writing this post is making me feel sick

That shouldn't annoy me as much as it does. (EDIT: lol that was pure co-incidence Chicanary, you posted while I was typing) Lol In regards to grammar. I hate when people use phrases like "I be," "we be," and etc. Depending on the circumstance I go crazy in my mind. Like if I'm browsing the internet and it happens, I realize I have to take into consideration this is informal writing and some degree of colloquialism is acceptable. But after awhile you realize that some people really don't know then I just go batshit bonkers. In real life... I find it hard to concentrate on what you're saying after say that. As for smoking... I can't stand most forms of chain smoking. It bothers me to the extent that I'll smoke yours just to get you to stop. But the absolute worst smoking habit that absolutely drives me ape **** is when people put their butts on grass like biodegradable or something. And I'm only slightly annoyed by people who want to tell me I shouldn't stop smoking. Most people who know me just know not to do it. The absolute worst smoking thing though is kids I cannot smoke around a child. If I'm in public and I see a kid, the cigarette/whatever I'm smoking goes. And if I see a pregnant woman smoking... no. Not happening. Or if you're smoking with what looks to be your child.. even if I know you, and know your kid is used to it, I can't smoke around a kid . It bothers me to the extent I sometimes take alternate routes to my destination so I don't have to see it.

 Not trying to sound like a Grammar Nazi but I hate when others use incorrect grammar. It literally annoys the hell out of me. People who smoke in front of kids. I don't have a problem if others smoke but PLEASE don't smoke in front of children. Men flip flops bother me too and I have no idea why. I also hate the smell of tuna fish. ANIMAL ABUSERS! They deserve to die. There is no excuse to hurt a animal.

 I'm sure i'm not the only one that hates this but I remember being younger and flipping shits out on people/women about this one.... When people respond wiht "Ok" or "K" in text or IM. Holy **** it drives me up a wall for some reason. It's all contextual though, because if it's in a response to something like "I'll be over soon" then I can fully understand just saying k or ok for confirmation. But when someone says that as filler or just saying it in place of what they really want to say, I go ****in mad. There is probably 100 of these niche things I hate but cant remember for the life of me right now...

 I hate being on public transit and having a seat to myself, and then when we get to another stop (there are still tons of empty rows, mind you) someone just decides to sit next to me. It's ten times worse when they have body odor. I don't mind people that smoke or smoking in general, but I hate when they put out their cigarettes and just throw the butt on the ground RIGHT NEXT to the ****ing trash can instead of just walking an extra step to throw it away. I also hate when I'm talking to someone and they look all over the place and look generally uninterested. (One of my good friends does this all the time so I try not to tell him anything for my own sake.) I have a lot more this is just all I can think of right now lol 
 Originally Posted by izana I also hate when I'm talking to someone and they look all over the place and look generally uninterested. (One of my good friends does this all the time so I try not to tell him anything for my own sake.) I'm fairly certain that everyone hates that. As for one of my biggest pet peeves that really infuriates me, is the people that stop their car on a straight road to let the car at the stop sign go through. There are only 3 cars behind you. The person at a stop sign can wait 5 seconds. They probably think that it's a nice gesture, but completely ignore the fact that they are ****ing with flow of traffic and the people behind them.

Or when the people at the stop decide to just zoom past and almost make me hit them. 
 I hate it when I'm playing a game such as soccer or football with my friends and one person takes the game so seriously, and cries when his team loses. It's not the Olympics! Also I hate when I'm watching a show or the news and my sister, who should be acting mature by now, starts throwing a tantrum because she would miss an episode of Spongebob, said episode would probably be repeated later. 
 So many books, so little time.
 When people are playing music on their iPod out loud and constantly listen to about half of each song before moving to the next one. My roommate constantly leaves the windows open despite it being bloody cold outside and I'm literally freezing... and she just sits in her room but if I complain, she tells me she pays half the rent. Which is true.... but I'm freezing. :s People who are friendly, but then suddenly act like they have no idea who you are. ._.

 This thread is now a "things everyone hates" thread. But hey, let's roll with it. 
 Anyway, mine is the sound of people drinking. Even if it's across the room, the glug glug glug sound makes me shudder. I need a little stress ball to squeeze when they do that. hahahaha that's pretty weird. I don't mind people drinking but I have a similar thing. I don't mind the sound of people drinking water; I really hate the sound of a crushing a water battle after its empty. The sound makes me want to punch walls. Most people don't mind cuz everyone is around crushing them making them into mini cannons. but i hate the sound. 
 I hate it when children clings onto me or even look at me. I try to smile but deep inside, I want to choke the living crap out of them. I don't know if everyone feels that way though.

 Idiotic dumb little children in my gaming guild, who they are are overpowered and top sh it. I have to handle with them since I'm seen as a 'bubbly and fun' character. Hate it. But otherwise, its just a specific type of pre-teens (12 ~ 13 year olds) I also hate people who lie to me because it benefits them - or they think that, through lying, they aren't hurting me - because deep down, it really bothers me but I don't bring it up. 
 
 I hate it when people keep asking me how I know X. I ****ing read books, try it some time, ****. Just because I took the time to educate myself doesnt mean you can look at me like I have a toad stool growing out of my forehead. Also when my cat sleeps on the frog palace.

 @Chica, Me too... but what pisses me off EVEN more... a kid in a ****ing chest carry bag thingy while the parent is smoking... makes me want to ****ing tell the person off. @Izana, What I hate is people on public transport who take as manY seats as possoble so people dont sit next to them. Especially on trains. I have this rule now, if a person is sitting in a 6 seater, I DONT GIVE A.**** if every other seat is empty, I WILL go and sit next to them. Unless they clearly arent normal.
