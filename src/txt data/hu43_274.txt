 Bring back A4 Club's
 Nobody likes social groups All the clubs died Edit: Everyone try and make the best out of social groups for now, I think better advertising I guess you can say should go into showing off the social groups, and definatly where it says social groups put a little more information and maybe pull in people a little more. I believe that social groups can make A4 clubs better than they used to be they just need a little more work. TESTING Keyword: Kusanagi
