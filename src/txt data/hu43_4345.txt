Have you been reading this thread at all? I was asked if flaming people who think violence as a solution is fine. My response was yes, I have no problem flaming people who think genocide is remotely a good idea. Unless I'm misinterpreting what you're saying and you think criticizing pro-violent people "contributes to the mass of global hatred that fuels the suffering." If that's the case then whatever.
