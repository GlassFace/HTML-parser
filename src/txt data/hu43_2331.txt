 Comic Con Birmingham, UK
 To all the British members, there's a comic con in the NEC in Birmingham on the 22nd-23rd March. It's kind of short notice but hey. Here is the website for the event. I'm going to be going there with a few friends. Is there even anyone on here from the Midlands besides me? There's a bunch of guests going like Andrew Potts, Alix Regan, Brian Murphy, Gerald Home etc. (Honestly I don't really care about the guests. I just love the cosplay. :3) Here's the ticket info~ Adult ticket: £10 (15+) Child ticket: £6 (11 to 14) Under 10s are free. It's 11am till 5pm but tickets stop selling at 4pm. Now I wonder if anyone will actually turn up.. :P
