 I want to ask all of you what your opinion on this movie is. I would have made a review, but I honestly still don't know how I felt about this movie. After watching this movie about a week ago (tehe) I was pretty much pissed off for 48 hours at the ending. After thinking about what I saw for the past week I still feel a little confused. I have to say this show had some really good realistic romance for pretty much the entire show. The ending was super realistic and after thinking about it (SPOILER) I assume the message was that actual relationships don't work without physical contact. All the messages throughout the show are really profound and the whole first part was an anxiety nightmare for any romance fan. The animation and sound of this movie are extremely high quality. This movie was amazing and I would recommend it to anyone. I will say though that you should watch a more happy simple romance like Toradora or Love Hina before treading across this movie. Did you guys enjoy the ending? Did you enjoy the movie in general? I thought it was overall pretty good with some new things thrown in. The serious tone along with beautiful artwork and animation quality make this movie a home run for me.
