[Fantasy] Kyoukai no Kanata (Beyond the Boundary)
 Kyoani just bore me to tears with their shows. First ep this one shoves three of the most dull and uncommitted characters in your face and then just expects you to be interested in the mumbo-jumbo supernatural sh*t. The glasses female lead was literally just a frankenstein's monster of pop-moe ideas stitched together... Feels like all they did from Chuukoi was swap out an eyepatch for glasses. But the thing I dislike most about kyoani series are the irritating fanbase it seems to spawn everytime, as I have a feeling this will have soon.
