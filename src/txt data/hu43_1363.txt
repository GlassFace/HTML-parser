 A4 Month Poetry and creative works contest!
 Hello! My second contest for A4 Month is going to be one Based from Poetry and certain specified other creative works! This is simple and going to be lots of fun! OK so here is what I am looking for! Theme: There is no theme! Let your creative juices flow unhindered by the restrictions of themes! What types of writings? : Poems, Short Stories no longer than 2-3 pages (ABSOLUTELY NO ANIME FAN FICTION). Length: No shorter than a Haiku and no longer and no longer than an Epic Poem lol! But if its an epic poem try to write it like so! Who will be judging? Me, a friend and anyone anyone else who is interested in judging when the month is over! Time expiration? The end of this month! Prizing? I dunno yet but its gonna be really cool! I will save it as a mystery until we pick a winner!
