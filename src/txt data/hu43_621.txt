 Fantasy Books
 I have finished ASOIAF and the three Dunk and Egg novellas. While I am waiting on GRRM to release the sixth book (which is hopefully soon...) Do any of you have a recommendation on something similar to fill the void while I wait? I just started the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan, I am about 250 pages into the first book and was wondering if anyone had an opinion on the series (is it worth reading etc)?
