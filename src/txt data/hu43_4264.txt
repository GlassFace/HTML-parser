[Personal Life Discussions] College Studies, What are You Enrolled For?
 I'm in college for 3D Modelling & Animation, specializing in animation. I wouldn't have learned any of this stuff without the assistance of my instructors. I'm not the type who can really learn with an online guide, I need to be able to interrupt someone, ask questions, get examples, and riff off them when I'm trying things out myself. I basically need mentors and peers to optimize my learning, and college is the place to do that. Tuition is too high but I'm willing to bite the bullet on that one. Without this training I'd be doomed to working jobs I hate for the rest of my life. since the company pays for it You get it for free? Do it.
