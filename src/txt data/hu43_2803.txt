 World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor
 Yeah, if I was just lucky to be able to play the little bit I did then that blows for everyone else. I'm pretty certain WoW was (and probably still is) getting DDOS'd. It happens anytime they launch anything, and they sustain a normal barrage of attacks all throughout the day anyway. Throwing us all in basically the same place was indeed pretty dumb. Must've been one of those long-term decision things where they knew it would be hell the first week or so but would smooth out over time.
