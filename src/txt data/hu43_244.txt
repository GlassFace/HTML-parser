 Comic discussion thread (DC and Marvel)
 You may have noticed the DC and Marvel discussion threads are gone. There's an excellent reason for this. Well, two actually. One, I thought one big thread would be better to start out the new year, maybe get a little more activity. Two, I goofed. Yeah, I made a mistake. I tried to merge the threads and did it wrong. So it died. But its ok. Because we have entombed it and there's this shiny new thread. TA DA! So DC and Marvel discussion goes here. Gamma thinks Marvel is better hands down...go.
