[Fantasy] Fairy Tail (2014)
 It's finally back, and I'm so excited! I see no other discussion thread for Fairy Tail, so here we go... Fairy Tail is set to broadcast every Friday starting on April 4, at 7:30pm Pacific Time (distributed on Crunchyroll in North America). "Finally! The anime based off of the hit manga series is back! After taking a year-long hiatus, Fairy Tail is finally back in action, continuing right where the first series left off. Following the adventures of Natsu Dragneel, Lucy Heartfilia,and the rest of their friends, the series jumps right back into the thick of the Grand Magic Games. Although the cast will be reprising their roles, with Tetsuya Kakihara and Aya Hirano as Natsu and Lucy respectively, there have been some changes to the staff, such as the character designer, with Shinji Takeuchi, who also did character designs for Gintama and Ixion Saga DT, coming on board. A-1 Pictures is still helming the animation production as well, but studio Bridge, whose other works include Nobunagun and Mitsudomoe, will be replacing Satelight." - Crunchyroll

 Finally! Fairy Tail continues! And at a great pace at that...  Spoiler I don't read the manga so the whole dragon/dragon slayer part was really informative but brought in a weird way...I mean a soul from a 400 year old dead dragon who wanders at the bottom of a floating Island is farfetched to say the least 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 It was amazing. So happy it is back. I read the manga aswell. So i knew what was going to happen but it far exceeded my expectations. I almost cried myself.watching this, never expected to do that. But sooooo happy it is back!!!!!

Thus, it stands to reason that his soul was left behind to wander the graveyard because of the grudge he held against Acnologia and humans. He was on the separatist side after all, and this explains why they chose that character point for him.

Nothing could have spoilt saturday either (watched 176) on saturday. I was in my informatics class when I found out , we had free time so I was on the net when I decided to check wiki and there it was fairy tail sequel I thought I had a heart attack and died and gone to heaven .I had to squeal and clap really quiet ... Good thing my classmate is into anime so I was blabbing in his ear how happy I was and I can't wait for the episode ... but he wasn't to happy when I started talking about Gratsu ... 
 I always knew they were coming back after a hiatus well before they actually ended the last block, but hearing the first official announcement of what season they were coming back for was ecstatic news for me!! <3

 Thanks for the post ned! I think I'll definitely add fairy tail to my watch list Not sure when I'll get to it but it's on there now 
 Lucy looks good in whatever lol...Damn I feel like the pace is going to slow down again now, and that everybody gets a full ep in battles that i've lost my interest in after the whole eclipse plot thingie... 'But Grey Always puts on a good show, so let's hope i'm wrong
