[Anime] Where do you watch you anime from?
 I primarily stream my anime from Netflix and some random anime streaming sites. I starting to get into Crunchy Roll. I use to watch anime from cable TV, but the selection of anime was very limited. I don't even have cable TV anymore. &nbsp;So instead, I'm using pay-once-per-month services to stream anime online. I don't have enough space on my hard-drive for torrenting anime and plus it takes too long to torrent. So I'm going to primarily rely on streaming anime from now-on, whether or not the anime streaming service is free.&nbsp;

 I torent mine

 *removed* is what I primarily use and everything else is just random so I just search up the anime title and the episode I want and find the best stream. Animefreak doesn't have everything of course, but it has a lot and I've been using it for years and it stays up to date with manga and anime.

 I like to torrent mine to watch and then convert into mp4 so that I can put on my iPod and watch on the go but since being at college I haven't been able to torrent so I either use hulu or just randomly search since you're bound to get a lot of hits. 
 I mainly watch mine on Chrunchyroll 

 I watch my anime on Crunchyroll, Youtube, and Funimation On Demand.

 I normally use Funimation and then branch out but easy to use funimation initially and if i like it I will find somewhere else depending on quality and such. 
 Generally i torrent mine but when the internet is slow or im in more of a rush i just stream it.

 I've only used YouTube to watch OHSHC dubbed and it works well with phones and mobile devices. Otherwise I use Netflix and mostly Cruchyroll. I had an Anime Network On Demand on my old cable which is what I would use a lot but I got new cable with no Anime Network Which sucks. I guess I also watch Toonami from time to time also. 

 I torrent all of mine. I haven't streamed anything in years. Once I started watching stuff in 720p/1080p I couldn't go back to streams.

 I tend to use my Roku and watch Crunchyroll for current shows, or shows that aren't out in dub yet, Netflix if I want to watch stuff like Girls Bravo and stuff that's on instant, otherwise I just go onto google or anime44. I also occasionally buy shows, but I only own kanon (2006) Girls Bravo, and Waiting In The Summer. (not counting my Miyazaki films) 
I hate this town. It's too filled with memories I'd rather forget. I go to school everyday, hang out with my friends, and then I go home. There's no place I'd rather not go ever again. I wonder if anything will ever change. Will that day ever come? -Tomoya Okazaki
 For me, VIZ anime, Crunchyroll, and Youtube are the way to go. They're all legal sources of anime. Also, if you make an account on VIZ anime, it's free and you can watch some very good animation (in HD) quickly (only advertisements).And no, VIZ anime did not ask me to advertise here. 

 i usually watch anime on streaming sites and I also download them sometimes i buy the dvds to but thats vary rare that I do that. 

 Kissanime.com It's great. He has plenty of anime and it was the only site I found that had One Piece in HD. Only some of the first seasons weren't in HD.
