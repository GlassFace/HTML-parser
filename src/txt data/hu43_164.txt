 End of gay ban in U.S. military a step closer
 Honestly, I think it's pointless. Enlisted homosexuals STILL are gonna keep mum. Why? .... do I need to explain? The abuse and heartache they'd endure from their fellow soldiers would be brutal, and you can't do anything about it. You have no civil rights in the military, so you can't sue for sexual abuse or harassment. That's why I think Don't Ask Don't Tell kinda helped homosexuals. The military really is a different world. But, wtvr. Lets see what happens. This should be interesting...
