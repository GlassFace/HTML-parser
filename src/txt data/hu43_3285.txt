 Help! I'm looking for a 'positive', 'cool' anime with awesome characters!
 Ah! My Goddess is very positive and heartwarming with great characters. Pita Ten would be very good as well, it's fun to watch and very heartwarming! Da Capo would be good as well, fun, positve, great characters and funny. Then Onegai My Melody is really entertaining if you can get past the cute Sanrio characters, but it's fun to watch. Of course, as a Squid, I recommend Squid Girl highly, it's the funniest anime ever!
