 Fall 2014 Hype
 So if anyone has already seen the charts for the Fall 2014 season, then you've certainly made judgements about what's up. Down below is what I personally am looking forwards to. Anime hype: Selector Infected S2, Log Horizon S2, Terra Formars, Amagi Brilliant Park, Inou Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de, Chaika S2, Gundam Build Fighters S2, and OMG Denki-Gai no Honya-san **** yeah I've been a fan of the manga for Denki-Gai for so long, what a pleasant surprise to see it being adapted into an anime. Amagi Brilliant Park, Terra Formars, and Inou Battle seem pretty interesting. OVA hype: Kill la Kill, Ishuukan Friends, No Game No Life, Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin, Gokukoku no Brynhildr, Suisei no Gargantia, Sekai Seifuku: Bouryaku no Zvezda - Shin Zvezda Daisakusen, Buddy Complex Kanketsu-hen -Ano Sora ni Kaeru Mirai de-, Wow! So many awesome OVAs for awesome anime.
