[Anime] IS Infinite Stratos - Season 2?
 Good news to any IS (Infinite Stratos) fans, just a new season has been green-lit!. I know many people were waiting for it , so give me your opinion what do you think about new season? For more info click here : http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news...ratos-tv-anime 
 
 I hope the protagonist won't be as stupid as he used to be in the 1. season And, yeah, a real ending would be cool as well 
 He should end up with Charlotte. Or anyone that is not Houki. I like Houki a lot, but please change things up so the "Main" girl doesn't win. Pull a Shuffle!

And i also want see an good ending in IS and more romance , cause the mc is really dense. 
 
 Finally, ep 1 season 2 is on Hulu. Ichika is still clueless but the plot seems a little darker. Are there more episodes on other sites?
