 The Big 3 Manga (Is is worth it?)
 I personally love the big 3 and I'm halfway through the original Naruto anime series along with being almost finished with Bleach and halfway through One Piece. However, I'm not sure if it's worth reading any of these manga. If any Naruto, One Piece, or Bleach enthusiasts could help me out here it would be appreciated EDIT: Just realized it should say "Is it worth it?" lol sorry sorry.

 I've watched through the original Naruto only and not through Shippuuden, so I can't comment much on it. I haven't seen Bleach at all. One Piece, though, I have watched through and am reading the manga weekly chapters now. Since you said you were half through with it, what did you think of it up until this point and on what arc are you currently? Do you have specific questions?

I'm on the fishman island arc where they meet a bunch of mermaids and stuff. The specific episode is episode 389 I think. I think I'm going to wait for the dub though since they are close to catching up with me and I really enjoy the dub. I just want to know if it's fun to read the manga and watch the anime.

 I've never read any of them.

 I only read and watch Naruto out of big 3 and I must say that I think it's worth reading it. Though that's my opinion only..

When I saw Sasuke and Naruto kiss each other I was like "Oh God it's happening!" I really like Naruto so far and I'm around halfway through it. You should really check out Bleach and One Piece. If you like Naruto you would at least love One Piece, and you would probably like Bleach.

 I'm currently watching the origina Naruto, I'm in Chuunin Exam arc and Bleach I already finished it and One piece, just got bored of it. 

 Naruto is worth it until shippuden. Unless your just a hardcore fan. It is not worth reading unless you want to hunt down certain sections of the manga afterward. Bleach is worth it, skip the first half of the aizen ark to save headache and time. OnePiece is worth it, but if you find yourself bored. Just skip to the CP9 ark and start from there.

 I think One Piece is worth it. The OP manga looks better than the anime anyway and Oda draws it in a quite clear way. Worth checking out.

It surely is fun for me. The manga obviously lacks colours but, other than that, looks better. Oda puts an adequate amount of information and action into the chapters and they're fun reading, I'm also still watching the weekly anime episodes. By the way, episode 389 can't be Fishman Island, 389 would be around Sabaody Archipelago? Or did you mix up numbers? 
 They're traveling to fishman island and I guess they meet a group of flying fish bandits and other fish men. I'm pretty sure its the fishman Island arc but idk you know more than I know.

I'm pretty sure its the fishman Island arc but idk you know more than I know. I know which one you're talking about, it has to do with Fishman Island but is the Sabaody Archipelago arc just yet. They met Caimie, Hacchan and Duval, right?

 ^ Your right YumYum about that being the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, you still have a few arcs to go before the Fishman Island Arc. Bleach Sucks, Naruto is all about saving Sasuke and once I realized that I lost interest in it. As for One Piece, I both read the manga and watch the anime. I read the manga because it's quick, but I watch the anime because a lot of times it goes into more depth than the manga, making you understand the story better. It's up to you if you want to get into the manga, I mainly read it because it's quicker than watching the anime and gets to the point with everything but in that quickness you loose depth so I watch the anime.

 No, No and maybe. Although I'll personally never finish One Piece as it bored me and there's is so much more intriguing and interesting stuff of out both in terms of manga and graphic novels I'd rather get my teeth into. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Hell no, I avoid the Big 3 manga and anime, I watched a few Naruto episodes, got bored with that series fast, then only 1 One Piece, decided there are much better series, and never really got into Bleach. I remember going to the library and checking out and reading Uresei Yatsura manga, it was so fun and weird to read, I'm glad never read Naruto, I would have given up on manga-anime if I had! The Takahashi, Clamp and Peach Pit mangas are wonderful! If you seen the Hayate-I Only got Eyes For You episode where Nagi tells Ruri to avoid certain manga because everyone's read it, that's how I feel too, the most popular series aren't the most interesting series or manga, at least to me, what I'm saying is broaden your horizons and experience many different anime and manga. 
 If your asking my opinion I would recommend that you do one at a time since there all so dense and complicated. you wouldn't want to OD on manga. also I would say finish bleach manga over the other two. it has the best manga of the three skip out on the one pice and naruto manga and transfer over to the actual anime. anime versions of one piece and naruto are better. 
Friends are a good thing, even if they tread a different path."[
