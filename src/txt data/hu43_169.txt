 Other Hobbies Thread
 I'd be nice to have a sub-forum for other hobbies like hunting, guns, model making, camping, collecting, geography, etc. Seems like the only non-anime hobbies forum is video games and TV/movies. Be nice if we had a forum for everything else not in that catagory. Not all of us are stuck doing stuff inside all day. :P
