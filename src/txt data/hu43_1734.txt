 Old Comic.
 Hey I just stumble across this old comic I did forever ago. It's one life of a video game character. Check it out and let me know what you think.  Spoiler 
 "But i killed you with love, you seemed very very sad as a door" To say the least, this was entertaining. You are better at comic making than I.
