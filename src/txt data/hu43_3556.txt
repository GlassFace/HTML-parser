[Fantasy] Tales of Zestiria: Doushi no Yoake
 So is this it? http://www.threeifbyspace.net/2015/0...n-ova-prequel/ I watched the ova prequel. Its good. It has that tales of feel for sure. At least the prequel has a small main cast. But since it sets up the story that would only be natural. And since it will have a travel sequence you'll no doubt encounter new people who will become team members. That's the way it usually goes. 20th anniversary!!!!! Yep 1995 was the first year for the tales series. Sad to say that I don't know what that first game was. Now I have to go watch the other tales anime's I haven't seen. The symphonia series was great since it was basically a fleshed out version of the game itself. And I absolutely love tales of vesperia. The First strike movie was very good but since it was a prequel it didn't quite have the same connection as the game. Still very good though. So I'll have to check my lists to see which tales anime is next on my list
