 The Big 3 Manga (Is is worth it?)
 I personally love the big 3 and I'm halfway through the original Naruto anime series along with being almost finished with Bleach and halfway through One Piece. However, I'm not sure if it's worth reading any of these manga. If any Naruto, One Piece, or Bleach enthusiasts could help me out here it would be appreciated EDIT: Just realized it should say "Is it worth it?" lol sorry sorry.
