[Drama] Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April)
 Wow I really teared up there at the end. I thought I was holding up there but I just couldnt at the end. My Gosh  Spoiler one of the comments about nagi was her being a lolicon!!!! And then the girls called watari  Spoiler a walking hard-on!!!! . My god what a show That music should be illegal. It just twists you in to the mood they want like nobody's business. I thought mind control by subliminal messaging was illegal? Who knew I'd like something so simple like this? I mean its not until you watch it that you get into the different aspects of the story line. I must be relatively unique on this website. I can enjoy something as outlandish as highschool dxd but then I can groove on a piece like your lie in April. How many shows does this have left? Oh and it was sweet that  Spoiler kao gets to listen to the concert on her phone
