 Nah you were pretty accurate. The zombified slaves are meant to be easily disposable. Their strength lies in the numbers. Much like actual zombies. Though I imagined their attacks to be more blunt force than strangling. Either way is fine. Not like I'm complaining about why they didn't beat Emily to death or anything lol.
