[Anime] How long can you watch anime in one sitting? - Page 2
 I can watch anime the whole day if I have the time. But mostly, I'm watching anime for about 4 hours a day after work. Reading manga, I can do it at work since I'm not that busy bee. Oh well, my day is not complete without watching anime or reading manga. It's just my stress reliever.

 Watched Deathnote in one sitting, so I guess that was the longest, 20 minutes an Ep x 37 740 minutes...so what? 12 or so hours. 

 Depends on if im tored or not and the length of the episode. Usually 2-3 episodes. 
 about 4-5 hours on a weekday in the school year, in the summer i can get in about 7 hours a day

 It depends. I finished both Code Geass anime and Shingeki No Kyojin in less than a week but it took me a month to finish both Higurashi No Naku Koro ni anime. That is because the start is a bit strange on both and when I have a bad start with an anime, I leave it for later. I also have a thing with anime over 200+ episodes. I finish them too fast.
