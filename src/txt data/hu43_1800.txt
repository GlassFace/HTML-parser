 How's it goin'?
 Konnichiwa, Anime-Forums! The last forum I was on kinda died out and so I Google'd an anime forum and this forum popped up as the first choice (who knew?). So, I'm here to talk about all kinds of manga, anime, games, and just about anything my random brain comes up with. Anywho, I like action, comedy, sci-fi, and supernatural genre for manga, anime, and books. My favorite types of music are rock, metal, and occasionally some techno although I'll listen to just about any music if it catches my interest. I don't really have a favorite food but my favorite drink is tea. I dislike sweet potatoes, avocados, discrimination, and the word "swagger" (even typing it just leaves me with a bad taste). I'm a very open person and don't get offended very easily. I hope that covers everything....
