 Japanese Hip Hop
 So recently at a bboy jam I was hanging with a fellow DJ and I had this beat from one of his mix tapes I wanted to get down with. He finally gave me the title and I have been bumping it nonstop. One of the things I wasn't expecting was a Japanese MC rapping. Then I realized I don't have much in the way Japanese Hip Hop. Sure I have Nujabes and such, YZK, Hifana, DJ BAKU, etc, but that really isn't good enough. So from the top dogs to the under the under ground, what Hip Hop groups, MCs, and DJs do you know from Japan? Thanks again for the support!
