 saint seiya: who is your favourite character and cloth
 as the title says who is your favourite character and what is your favourite cloth and say why that is your favourite character and cloth. if you don't know what saint seiya is I recommend looking it up. I've started watching it and I think it would be interesting to see what characters and cloths are popular. ok so my favourite character has got to be saga after looking him up I thought that he had a very interesting story being all split personality and all and I think that his abilities are pretty cool too. my favourite cloth would have to be the Gemini gold cloth which is worn by saga it is my favourite because I think it looks cool and it just so happens to be my zodiac sign, I like how the helmet has to different faces on it. Â Spoiler if this is in the wrong part of the forum please can you correct that mistake thank you.
