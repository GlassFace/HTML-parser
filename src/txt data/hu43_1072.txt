[Personal Life Discussions] the culture of butt hurt overly sensitive whiners
 Lately people have been saying this, atleast the people I interact with. People whine and get hurt over the most ridiculous and the smallest of things, more and more. Why do you think this is? How do you think it affects us, individually or as a society as a whole? A comment I heard, "this is why when people talk nowadays, they cant really say whats in their minds anymore, that they always have to walk on egg shells or risk hurting people and causing drama. theres always something that people would get butt hurt about" 
 I usually ignore butt hurt/whining people because all they do is b1tch and complain about pure nonsense stuff that I personally can never get myself to care about. My acknowledgement of that behavior is as far as that goes. When I say something, I don't think about if I may hurt people's feelings, but I don't like anything to come out as deliberately offensive to someone either. Posting here for example, I may make posts that people may disagree with me about, in which I welcome. However if there is opposition that goes beyond anything other than disagreement, then you're not worth my time.

 Not sure how much I buy of this whining about walking on egg shells. We live in a society that I'd like to believe is progressive. Sometimes if you grew up around a certain type of environment you might let the word "gay" slip out as a negative remark, but aside from that, if you offended someone (TRULY, offended someone) it was highly likely your intention. http://www.boreme.com/posting.php?id=29555 does come to mind, though. Not a fan of using the word "butt hurt" to describe sensitive people. Always thought butt-hurt implied you've gotten raped, which is slang for "you got beaten" in an argument or video game. 
 
 Butt hurt is a perfect world for the majority of people now a days, they can't take anything and they will go directly to blaming you and trying to get something out of it because your hurt their feelings. Also I use the word gay all the time, regardless of it hurting someones feelings. I heard somewhere that teachers should use blue pens or something because red pens stress kids out which is BS, if the kid go a question wrong, they should know it. I forgot to mention that there are numerous of butt hurt people that use these forums.

 A generation raised in a hyper PC world, with their parents telling them they are special snowflakes and that anything that goes wrong is not their fault --> Result --> hyper sensitive people with an over developed sense of entitlement. Then combine that with schools slowing down to the dumbest kid ( so they don't feel bad ), and you have a generation of people ill prepared for the real world. So the end result is they whine. Solution --> STFU, realize everything isn't about you and your feelings, and take responsibility for your actions and resulting consequences. I personally enjoy how these people always go on about the injustices of the world and think that "raising awareness" is actually doing something; as if no one has ever noticed a problem before these people came around with their astounding insight. The reality is people are already aware, and the reason they don't do something about the problem is because a good solution hasn't been created. Basically if you don't have a solution to present, don't bring up the problem. "X isn't fair! No sh*t, but what do you propose to do about it?" Yappity Yap yap is not a solution. 
 We've been obliterating each other for over a millennia for "senseless" skirmishes. But entitlement is right on the money. We live in an entitlement, instant gratification culture that fuels itself through inane formats such as Twitter and Facebook. There's a whole swirl of PC crap that floats around. But the buck should stop at home. Schools can throw that "search your feelings" Disney stuff. But parents need to be more involved. Step up their game. I mean, if your parents were the whiners of their generation, seek a second opinion. Not to mention the government won't let you raise your kids anymore, anyway. Hell, you can't really spank or do much these days (that's a story unto itself). So, continue making duck faces (I just found out what the hell this nonsense was a few months ago, btw. Wish I had stayed in obscurity on the matter) and falling into fountains at your local mall while texting. Not to say PC isn't warranted in some cases, but I think we can agree that the "PC movement" is a juggernaut rife with abuse. Entitlement. Entitlement. Entitlement. Some in this generation get it. Sadly, many more do not. Is it a perfect world? No. Is it a doomed world? Probably. In our lifetime? Probably not. This is why the run of the mill tag on a news article is often someone being fired over sh*t they couldn't say.. or wouldn't say to said person's face. So what's the next best idea? Post a tirade of it on FB or whatever. But there's good news and bad news on the subject. The good news is, there can be a balance to certain entitlements, and adjustments in society that can be beneficial to us all. Bad news? People don't get along, and they're generally idiots. But honestly, avoid people like this when possible. Sometimes you'll have to put up with it in a work environment, or during necessitating shopping incursions, but don't give attention to these people and make them your "pet project" of the day. Let it go, and move on. We live in a world where we can't sweat the small sh*t all the time. Huh. Kind of went into a little tirade of my own.

Individual Eleven: Rise Up. Never conform. 
 A lot of people are cruelly ignorant and insensitive on any number of subjects, and tend to throw around the phrase "butt hurt" or call people whiners when their bigotry actually offends someone. 

 I don't think being overly sensitive is always a bad thing, really. Especially concerning sexuality. People don't often realize how their words are effecting people. People today, myself included, don't really think about the weight our words hold. Saying **** like 'oh, that's gay' IS offensive and shouldn't be tolerated. It's insinuating that gay = bad and in this day and age, that is offensive. Of course, some people do take it too far and get offended too often at every little thing. Still, we should be mindful of our words.

 I personally think it's a little bit of what everyone has already said on this issue. I also feel the media blows things out of proportion and suddenly people are more offended by things that wouldn't have normally have affected them before.

Here is one of our resident frequent sufferers of proctalgia. While many myself included speak ignorantly, resorting to label them bigots for being obstinately and zealously attached to an opinion you do not entertain, yielding to a notable lexicographer is the definition of a bigot and dually an example of being "butt-hurt".

 I think Messrs Haddaway said it best, when he exclaimed 'What is hate? Baby don't butt-hurt me, don't butt-hurt me, no more.' Paraphrased.

It's the catchall defense: by belittling the person who disagrees with you and acting like they hold views that are abnormal you can absolve yourself of any meaningful dialog. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 There is always something that we are sensitive about. I am sensitive about certain things. I am not sure if I have ever showed it, but I have learned that its better to suppress your emotions or simply ignore it, or be indifferent. if you feel insulted about certain things it's much more preferable to say why you feel so...give your own reasons, discuss it if possible. If its someone you don't know at all, then the best is to ignore it. Also, it's good to talk to someone close to you about how you feel rather than getting into conflict with someone you actually don't know because that person won't understand you and you would look like someone who doesn't know how to control yourself. I personally don't like overly sensitive people. Always give me impression that they are full of hatred or that they cannot cope with their own demons. If possible I would prefer them away from me. 
 There's nothing new under the sun. All of these things that we're talking about have been talked about before, just in a different context. Don't let it worry you. Do what you have to do. Say what you have to say and accept the consequences of it. Don't fall prey to the supposed anonymity of the internet and try to be a decent human being.

 I don´t really like that kind of people, they are quite annoying. I had a friend that got upset over anything and well, in the end I couldn´t take her mood-swings so I broke contact with her... It affected me so that I now take more distance to people and I break contact with people pretty quickly if I start finding them annoying. Dunno if it´s affected me in a good or bad way... Can´t really say..

Can´t really say.. Thats actually the same thing with me I cant stand people who are over sensitive. I do try my best not to hurt people or offend them, but theres a time where it just gets boring to talk to those people when they cant even joke or always respond like you did something wrong whenever you say any little thing I steer away from people like that 
 Who are these magical people that are offended by everything? I'd be annoyed, too, if I wasn't convinced you lot were making them up. As Gamma said, just be a decent human being and you should be in the clear.

I try to be polite as well but there is a limit to how much of peoples emotional instability I can take. Just get a god damn psychologist.... Ush, over sensitive crybabies- Ain´t that nice... :/

What else would you propose doing, besides whining about strawmen, when someone actually has the audacity to call you out on racist and/or sexist rhetoric? 

 I like how some people wanna say some **** and expect nobody to say nothing. Talk about entitlement.

 I've got a good idea, lets complain about people who complain. It makes perfect sense. More to the point though, I think people like to pick teams/take sides, and start arguments/fights. In everything. I think this thread is also an example of that general human habit. Says a lot about the mini-tirades.

 Tenken is absolutely right. There's something to be said for strength in numbers, especially when one side or the other knows they've been called on being wrong and simply won't acknowledge it.

 To be honest complaining makes it worse. What I do is just separate from that group of complaints and just go into my little world. I was born with super patience. How I'm not sure but enough about me. Lately at my school seems like the smallest things have been pissing everyone off. Just the other day someone got a chair pulled away from under them. Funny joke huh? Simple prank but guy gets pissed and fight broke out. Tempers seem to be high. Kinda scares me but again I don't really care much.
