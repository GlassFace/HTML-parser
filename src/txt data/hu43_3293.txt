 Episode 674
 I normally don't talk about an episode of One Piece and I usually stick to chapters but this episode is one that portrayed what Oda has planned way better then was portrayed in the manga. Now in the manga before operation SOP was completed we saw Usopp running away. I thought this was him being his usual self which it was, but I didn't get that the dwarves didn't know he had already ran away, I thought they knew and was calling out to him, I also didn't get that a transponder snail was involved and I didn't realize how far he had ran from them before returning. But I mainly make this thread to take back my statement about Usopp being useless. This was unnecessary but kind of was a sogeking moment, but instead of hiding behind the Usoland persona, used his real self to show the dwarves what he can do and that he isn't a liar which he is and we all know he is. This act was cool and funny but I still want to see Oda make more use out of him. If up to date with manga.  Spoiler With in the manga him gaining haki, we should see him being useful...I hope.
