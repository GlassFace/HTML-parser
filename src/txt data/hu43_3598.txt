 Vegeta vs Hulk!

The main differences between a planet and a moon are the size and mass, which just translates to scale. Unless you want to argue density and composition of any given planet, which can work against the Hulk too for your asteroid example. Basically, the bigger it is, the more power you need to blow it up. If I give you a recipe that serves ten but you want to feed a hundred, then all you have to do is multiply everything by ten. It is pretty clear to me that the kamehameha wave can be scaled up to destroy planets if it can be scaled up to destroy a moon, which would perfectly explain why Cell was shocked that Goku would point it at the Earth in their fight. So lets move on from the whole power measure and examine their fighting styles, experience, and mentality.
