 Are Lolicons Pedophiles?
 Simply put: Are people who view underage children in hentai/ cartoon porn to pleasure themselves pedophiles? I ask this, because in my time here, and my general time online, I have noticed an abnormally large number of people who consider loli "perfectly fine", yet, in the rest of society it's viewed as no different to child pornography involving real children. So, I ask you the question A4, in an attempt to understand why people think they aren't pedophiles when they clearly are attracted to the childlike form, and to purposely influence the culture here to make it seem less acceptable.
