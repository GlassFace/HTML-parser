[Mecha] Aldnoah.Zero
 Picked this up and watched it throughout the week. Pretty good show so far, enjoying the grandoise plot and the "how do we beat the next bad guy?" formula. It's almost structured like a video game, especially in the first season, where every boss has a special ability and the final boss has them all rolled into one. Pretty interesting take on the concept. I really wish that Slaine wasn't the only interesting character, though. Everyone else has been diluted to one or two traits which they act out ad nauseam with almost no variation. They're all archetypes, and archetypes are boring for me. There's also some plot holes and strangeness going on that, if the overall story wasn't so interesting, I'd be obsessively tearing apart right now. It's nothing that was ruin the whole show for me but it could be a lot better. Having said all that this is one of the more interesting shows I've seen in many seasons. Looking forward to the conclusion.
