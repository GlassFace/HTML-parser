[Adventure] Pokemon Origins
 Yeah 4 episodes cover the entire gen 1 game. It was actually done very well and at the same time went a long way in promoting Pokemon X and Y. The last fight in the final episode was insane, I didn't think i would see something like that in a Pokemon anime lol

The dreams of those who have fallen, the hopes of those who will follow. Those two sets of dreams weaved together into a double helix drilling a path towards tomorrow. And that's Tengen Toppa! That's Gurren Lagann! My drill is the drill, that creates the heavens!"~ Simon
