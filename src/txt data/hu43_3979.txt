 Help Identifying Anime
 Hi All, I watched an anime a year or two ago. However, I forgot its name. Here is what I know. * Took place mainly at school (hahaha... Ok that is almost like every anime I guess) * Students would wind up being killed mysteriously or go missing. * During this time people wouldn't remember them or what happened at the school before. * It was a possible student that was causing this. One that was actually not enrolled. * only 12 to 13 episodes long. *spoiler* * Turned out to be a possible teacher or the main characters guardian. I think she was both.
