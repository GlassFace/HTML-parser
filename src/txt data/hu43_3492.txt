 Gundam x Hip Hop Designs
 I additionally have prints available on my Etsy page, and each print (except for the Ball) comes with a sticker that matches the prints. I hope that I'll be able to sell these prints and more during this years anime convention season, starting off at ACEN if I get accepted into artist alley, Anime Midwest, and eventually Youmacon. So if you or someone you know likes or even loves Gundam, I would appreciate the help of letting people know about my work. Thank you! https://www.etsy.com/shop/EasterlyArt http://easterlyart.tumblr.com/ https://www.facebook.com/EasterlyArt
