 Killing the Thinking (part 1)
 I didn't edit your work, just added spaces where necessary. I get the feeling your family is like the story. Anyway here is the story with spacing, I had nothing better to do and I don't have time to write my next part for my story which I'll be doing tomorrow. As for what I think of the story, I understand it, a lot of work I've been reading is hard to understand/picture. But you have a ways to go with your writing. Narration is hard so I just suggest a reread for now and find your mistakes. I've been practicing writing forever now, since I was 16 or younger, not sure when I started, like summer school before I headed into High School and now I'm 24. It's hard to explain to you your issues when I can't remember how I use to patch my work when I was younger. Just drafts upon drafts, taking out stuff and adding stuff, making sure the flow is right all that annoying stuff. I hate writing but I love story telling. Anyway good luck with this story, I look forward to reading more but I rarely do. I'm not great with keeping up sorry about that.  Spoiler No one likes a spoil sport, Indigo said as her little brother cried on the ground. Youre the one who spoiled it he snapped. Indigo laughed at her brothers frustration this did not help the situation one bit. Tamo never liked playing soccer with his older sister he always lost miserably and Indigo never gave him the benefit of the doubt. Always a smart ass comment, (this also made Indigo a very successful internet troll.) Come on lets go Auntie is coming over today and we need to get ready. As the words came out of her mouth Indigo groaned mentally while Tamo groaned out loud. Neither of them were fans of their Auntie because she was always trying to get her clammy hands on the family vineyard. There family was known for having some the best vineyards in all of Australia. More over it was rear for an indigenous family to be so successful in the business world. Indigo had always heard that her mothers sister had always been jealous she had married into such a family and would never give up on getting the family fortune. She also said just as much that she would never let her have it and neither should she as the family heir. Keep up Tamo, Indigo yelled behind her as she ran in front. Unfortunately she was not looking were she was going and ran straight into Junjo a tall chubby girl with big bust, she provided a stark contrast to Indigo who was short and completely flat chested. Watch it!, she spat. Sorry I didnt see you there, Junjo huffed at Indigos excuse. Thats funny I didnt see you there either but I think in my case it was more reasonable. She said in a sing song voice while looking down at Indigo. We both didnt want to see each other at the same time kindred spirits you and I she said. I wouldnt know about that Indigo said sheepishly trying not to start a fight, mostly because Junjo could kick her skinny brown ass. You dont know about anything because youre stupid she replied this time in a matter of fact sort of voice. By that time Tamo had caught up with his sister and was even more not willing to start a fight with the cow. He would like to believe it was because he did not like to hit girls but in reality it was because he was even skinnier and shorter than Indigo was. Oh thats a good one Junjo he said while letting out a much too fake laugh. We were just leaving, company coming over and all, There was a long pause with Junjo standing in the way between them and the rest of the path. No, not till I am compensated for all my pain and suffering she said with a grin eyeingIndigos purple heart shaped necklace. Indigo handed it over almost immediately (online was the only time she stood up to people after all.)
