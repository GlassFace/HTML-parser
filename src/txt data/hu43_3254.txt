 What's your "style"?
 I was reading a random rolling stones article that has nothing to do with style. In fact, it was about a girl in cali who committed suicide caused by sexting (http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/...0130917?page=2). But in this article, it described the cool kids as wearing - "See-through shorts and thongs pulled up, shorts pulled down," recalls an older girl. "That's what the 'cool girls' wore." The boys they hung out with favored a uniform locally dubbed "swagfag" Â– snapback hat, PacSun tank tops, knee-length chino shorts and Vans. And my reaction was...wtf? But then I started thinking about style in terms of our upbringing, our influences and location. I'm just curious, if you had to describe your "style", what would you say?
