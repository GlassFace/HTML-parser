[Event] [Round 2] A4's Greatest Villain: Elfa vs. Pinky vs. Kayla-dono
 In our first corner.... we have Elfa, representing all the former glory of the Soviet Union! Vladimir Putin was her mentor, so beware, people. She comes prepared, and ready to kick ass. She's short, but is not to be underestimated! She's tougher than she looks, folks. Plus, her boyfriend TonyTony cleared his anti-hero round. Challenge her if you dare.. And in our second corner, we have Pinky, the Blue Flamingo! She'll crush you with her height, and beat you with her motorcycle to boot. Her new Chevy car is not to be underestimated either.. She'll run you over and won't look back. And if you thought pansexuals were nice, think again, *******s! She's taking names and running you over without regard. And she takes no consideration for children either. If your kids are in the street, they're fair game! She'll hit them too! And last but not least, we have Kayla-dono, better known as Hitler-dono! She'll castrate you and feed you your entrails, and 10 minutes later, forget all about it. Has a bizarre master-servant complex, but it serves her well. She skins live kittens, and she'll throw Mihstah to the lions if I summon it. Making her a great contender for getting rid of the useless, pecking order. Fear her, or face her NAZI BOMBS GALORE! And..... BEGIN!

 This competition is supposed to be all about bribery, coercion and threats... pretty sure that's where judges points are coming from anyway 

 Yep I guess I need to start threatening people.-goes to make a riot-

 I thought only guys liked taking pictures of "dey d.icks" and sending them to people. This event features an all female cast, so I'm obligated to somehow stick myself in so that I belong. I vote Elfa, her compliment to my oxford won me over. Ganbate Elfa! Fight!

 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses. Beside you as you like softly down, I will be until I hear the words "Checkmate". ~Sebastian Michaelis ~ Individual 4 ~ A4's Greatest Villain <Right Here Lmao
