 Do you read the book first or watch the movie first?
 I don't really enjoy reading, so I'd normally watch it first. As for novelizations, I've read some parts of "The Cabin in the Woods", which was the only novelization I've ever read. It was okay, but I consulted it because I wanted to learn how to write stories spun from movie plot-lines... Not a good idea, as Tim Lebbon used a casual writing format that only an experienced writer would know how to use flexibly without errors. Aside from that, I think novelizations are a good idea. If you're a 'visual person' person like me who has trouble with words but good with pictures, novelizations can help you learn how to translate the movie scenes into words the next time you feel like writing a fan fiction based on a movie.
