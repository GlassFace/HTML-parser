[Action] Fuuun Ishin Dai Shogun
 The color coordination in this episode was fantastic! There was an incredibly awesome boss fight, the anime pulled off the entire "hero achieving true power" thing well, no sappy or BS developments. However, the antagonists both had pretty lame reasons for what they were doing. Shigeyoshi was all like "I will bring honor to Hell!" and the Slut was just like "I'm bored." Woah, floating fortress? That must be the main base in Edo. Y'know, I see some people shaming this anime for "desecrating" the Tokugawa clan name and labeling the story as awful or mediocre. Well, I have to say that some elements of the story were sub-par, but the series itself was enjoyable as hell. Loved this anime, awesome one to sit back and enjoy yourself.
