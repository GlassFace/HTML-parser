 Any scifi anime recommendations?
 Hiya, Do you guys have any recommendations for a scifi animation? Looking for a series that's short, between 6 episodes and 24. Nothing too grim or a dystopia theme, something perhaps more happy? Last scifi animation I watched was, Steins;Gate which I quite enjoyed. Thanks.
