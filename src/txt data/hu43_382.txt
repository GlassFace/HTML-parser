 What are you currently Playing?
 I'm currently playing a few games... Captain Toad Treasure Tracker - It's a really fun low key puzzle game with nice visuals and some challenging levels. Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy - Another puzzle game. If you've played Professor Layton before you know what to expect - an entertaining story with puzzles/riddles. Killzone Shadow Fall - I'm working through the campaign mode at the moment. It looks really nice but is pretty cliche and CODish. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing.
