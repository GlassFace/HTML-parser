[Action] Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan) - Page 5

The pomegranate addition was especially good too; there's a buddhist story about a giant learning to eat them instead of humans, as well as the older fables, like the Greek story of Persephone making it a "fruit of the dead" so to speak. They did a fantastic job with "abnormal" titan as well. Seeing him box off the enemy titans entire head and just brutally crush what was level was really cathartic.  Spoiler box? I think b*tch slap is a better word for that k.o.

 WOOHOO I caught up and can finally discuss. I was thrown off by the first couple episodes and was getting a little bored, but I hung in there, now after watching episode 7 I really do not know what to believe anymore. The "Abnormal" Titan aka the Elf Titan (personal name) I was like WTF!!! I don't wanna read the manga because I am enjoying the anime now, but the anticipation is going to kill me haha.

While the art of the manga is pretty terrible, the story is top notch--let's hope that it's maintained up until and beyond all current questions are answered. I've yet to get around to watching the anime, but I hope to get to it tonight. Rivaille's ****ing boss, btw. Woah, that sounds like one piece. I expected the art in the manga to be something like bersek >.> but the anime totally blows away the manga in visuals and just makes it more enjoyable to watch as an anime. You kind of get that feeling from the start of the show because it starts with a world that's kind of ambiguous and starts to get more interesting as we reveal more info about a world that we don't know much. The rivaille dude reminds me of the guy from gantz, if you've seen the anime.

 Been holding off on the anime for a while now. Might watch it seeing as everyone in the thread rates the animations quite highly. Also, they seem to have taken it easy on censoring the blood and gore...

 Just sat through 1-7, and i do think the show is quite good. It portrays the emotional turmoil of despair very well down to each individual. I really enjoy the show starting essentially pre-conflict and watching the characters change during their indoctrination into the country's military. I liked how there is a subtle love interest, and how its not over the top, it isnt even completely clear as well. One of my favorite elements is the show's ability to emulate the harshest of realities when it comes to combat, which gave it a very, "Blue Gender" vibe. Come to think of it most of the reasons why i thought Blue Gender was done so well reoccur in this anime. And i was very relieved i didnt see huge genitals, everyone was thinking the same thing, I'm just saying it. The only problems i have with the show as of yet are due to lack of information which of course comes with time, and is probably part of the reason i watched all 7 episodes back to back, which is a good thing. Its just of course the mysteries are very well done and I yearn to have some light shed on them.

 I just checked ANN to see if it was only 12-13 episodes (just in case) and It's slated for 25 thank god. In my personal opinion  Spoiler Eren cannot be dead, somehow I know he survived, because they had that whole thing with his father and the basement and the Key. Unless he gave the key to Mikasa I doubt Eren is dead, but Obviously he is. Missing that arm and leg of his.

 So Eren is the titan, he has his limbs back, and everything is right in the world...Granted Eren Titen going HAM on other titans was cool, but I felt the episode was a little poor. I would assume whatever Daddy injected into Eren made him that titan and we'll find out everything next week.

 Yep, really impressed with the way they handled the reveal in this episode. Beautiful art direction and music selection, and a really solid job of animating the characters expressions given how unbelievable the situation was. 

 I am really not surprised that the titan that killed all titans in his path as if he hated them with all of his hate turned out to Eren Jaeger.

 Well, I saw that one coming, and then again, I didn't... Eren made an epic comeback, and I there to say 8 episodes in, this will be one of the greatest animes ever. The story has so much directions it could go to, and the scheduled numbers of eps for the show could only mean, that if it continues to go on like this, it'll become an classic. All the questions that remain now, like how did Eren become an titan, how it could change from a grey kinda old looking titan to a totally different looking one. Also what does his mysterious dad do to him etc etc. I'm hooked... 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 Hi guys, here is a new AMV of Shingeki no Kyojin I have just finished. Please watch and tell me what you think. Hope you enjoy it 
 Great episode liek Ian said, awesome animation of everything. Seems like armin is making himself useful for what he lacks in strength he makes up in battle plan which is just as important, if not more.  Spoiler I kind of guessed that somehow the people that the titans consume are still alive. It was sated during the class session that they their means of reproduction are unknown, maybe they consume humans to live on or something. Godamn so much stuff we don't know and it's still unclear. I hope it gives us more information though as in much bigger chunks IT does make you want to much more but it also makes it a little bit of annoying to just keep giving information bit by bit. The next episode shows Eren getting discrimnated for turning into or controlling a titan or whatever. Which suggests that it has nothing to do with reporduction, but everything to do with Eren being somehow unique. This is most likely has something to do with mysterious dad.

This is my opinion but Ill wrap a spoiler around it.  Spoiler I think it is some kind of bacteria or virus. Because if you noticed after Eren got dismantled he came out of the neck of the titan. The same spot where the kills need to take place. Now what makes that specific spot special? Also the titans could also be reproducing by some kind of budding. SO really the main questions are Why are there titans? how come more keep coming? Are the people still alive?

They don't digest or even appear to absorb anything.

 Anyone even read the manga? I could drop a whole world of spoilers right now. Poor Eren 

 Yeah you'll get banned if you post manga spoilers.

 I just started watching it last night after putting it off since episode one and I have to say this anime is amazing! It has great animation, voice acting and the story is great! 

 Originally Posted by Struggler  Spoiler They vomit out the humans they eat after a while. Leaving big, slimy piles of dead bodies in their wake. They don't digest or even appear to absorb anything. Yeah I edited the last two lines i after I realized it would make no sense as I saw next espiode's preview.  Spoiler So I'm guessing it's unique to him then. And usually in every show no power ever remains unique so well probably see more having this short of thing. Idk if that helps or detracts from the theme of the show or its purpose. 
 Well I think that last part could have mirrored the manga better because it liked pasted there, but what can you do.
