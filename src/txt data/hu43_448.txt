 Romance Anime/s That Made You Cry - Page 3
 Psh! No anime title has ever made me cry. Okay, maybe I did and that's thanks to Cowboy Bebop. However, there’s this single romance anime film which almost (ALMOST, okay?) made me cry, and that's 5 Centimeters Per Second. I don’t even know why I felt really emotional during the film. It could be because I went through the same thing but also maybe because I was drunk. 
 
 The last episode of AnoHana turned me into a mumbling pile of mush for a couple days. I don't think I've cried so hard at an anime. Toradora jerked some tears for me at a couple spots and I had a couple tears roll down my cheeks during Angel Beats. That's really all I remember for romance anime, though. Edit: Okay, I finished watching Ano Natsu de Matteru last night and went to bed in tears. Just thought I'd let you guys know.

 clannad and clannad AS seems to be popular and rightly so, most crying ever, I also cried at the last episode of angel beats, even though the other ones were emotional. Shuffle at the end and a few other moments, though a happy ending always makes it better. Gunslinger girls was pretty touching and I loved the art in the first season, though it is not a romance one.

I shed some tears for Shuffle too, some heart breaking moments but I love the ending non the less. 
 They are so many actually ;3; But... Air TV & Sola ~ make want to cry even just by remembering them D: tho I cried on Ano Hana & Angel Beats too ; _ ; and couple of more that i can't recall atm D:

 Full Moon Wo Sagashite made me cry a lot...T___T It was the first time I ever cried of an anime... it's pretty sad you should watch it although it is 50 something episodes...But it's worth it... it's a turn of events in the ending episodes...;___: Oh also Air TV like everyone. I am planning to see Clannad...lots of people say it's freaking sad...

Sometimes I feel like people make it out to be a sob fest. 
-_____- That is all, dismissed.
 RomeoXJuliet ( really really sad .. ) & Kimi ni Todoke 
 In the end, it's not going to matter how many breaths you took, but how many moments took your breath away.... 
 Everyone had already said Clannad. I haven't seen much of the anime, but my sister downloaded the game + an English patch and it is excellent! So far Fuuko's arc had me tearing up...  Spoiler When Sanae tried to hug Fuuko, but couldn't because she (Sanae) couldn't see Fuuko anymore, but knew Fuuko was there.（；_・） I'm really looking forward to seeing more of the game, then the After Story part. Then, the anime! Kanon had me crying for a couple of different scenes. Excellent watch, that. AIR TV had me crying during the last two episodes. For the most part, it wasn't as good as Kanon, but those last two episodes were so emotional. ´＿｀ Ano Hana was a tear jerker near the end. I think that there are going to be a lot of people that will say that I have a heart of stone because I didn't cry during every episode, but I didn't. Don't get me wrong though, it was a really good watch from start to finish--the watcher would never feel lacking on how the characters felt. Not really a romance anime, but XXXHolic had me tearing up...  Spoiler during the ghost lady arc. I almost felt Watanuki's sadness and loneliness....but I'm probably just a wimp, lol. Sadly, my suggestions are no where near unique. D:

Enough chit-chat let's get happening. Here are those that made me cry my eyes out. 1. Clannad 2. Clannad After Story 3. Sola 4. Angel Beats!(last episode) .....that's all i remember I'm not one to cry very easily, but I have to agree with Clannad After Story, that anime is a serious tear jerker.

 "ASDFG;@F#!! FMA BROTHERHOOD LOOKS SO GOOD ON BLU-RAY" - Me  Spoiler un-spoiler for my favorite thing 
 Since I haven't watched all of the Key anime , this is not the whole list: 1. Clannad and After Story 2. Sailor Moon 3. Full Moon wo Sagashite 4. Marmalade Boy 5. Peach Girl 
 DynaBlade made this signature My Blog and YouTube channel :3  Spoiler http://www.hardpliers.blogspot.com/  Spoiler http://www.youtube.com/user/hardpliers Currently watching Sailor Moon
 Clannad After Story, 5 Centimetres per Second, Vampire Knight, Absolute Boyfriend made me cry a lot - during the series/chapters or because of the ending. 
 
 Joining the Clannad and the Clannad AS club Along with Clannad AnoHana had me in complete tears Some other ones were Angel Beats and a couple times in Zero No Tsukaima. 
 Clannad After Story because it was a lot more dramatic than Clannad. Angel Beats is not romance right?? But it didn't mention that it was also a bloody drama! http://www.animefreak.tv/watch/angel-beats-online 
 Dubstep Chaos Theory - ShockOne l Siren - Kat Krazy ft Elkka l Faith - BlasterJaxx 
 e and it still didn't affect me much.

 Fetishes are the first steps to happiness. ;3 
 Yerrrp everyones said it. Clannad. Twice in the first season and i dont know how many times in the second. 
 Anime-Planet.com - anime | manga | reviews
 The end of Fate/Stay night , Katanagatari , Toradora and Legend of the Legendary Heroes (mc went through hell because of his eyes really sad). 
 
 Ano Hana was a series of neverending tears from me. I also cried when Inori died from taking the whole Lost Christmas virus with her, so she had to leave Shu behind. Clannad After Story...my list goes on. 
 Anything that has some kind of Graduation ceremony in it or any heartfelt romance at the end gets me everytime. For instance the second to last episode of Pet Girl of Sakurasou..."Misaki's Speech" For those who have seen it you know EXACTLY what I mean. Deaths do not really get me unless the character has made a strong connection to me or the main character. Like in Sword Art I know Sachi had a strong connection With Kirito and her death made me tear up, but I wasnt balling my eyes out. Edit: Kotoura-san, Maid-sama, Gj-Club, Heavens Lost Property. Just some extras which made me tear up.
