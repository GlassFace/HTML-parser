 Street Fighter x Mega Man.
 Capcom's trying to persuade Megaman fans to not abandon the company with this brand new, free classic Megaman game with Street Fighter themed bosses~ http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2012/d...d-boss-battle/ Sadly, this project started in 2010? 2011? It's a fan-made game, and Capcom halted the lead developer's progress on it to host it as their own. Capcom's been sad lately as a company, but I'm looking forward to this. It will be available, free for download, on Monday at the Capcom Unity website. 
 Hey~ Midget.
 Hmm well I don't know, I like Street Fighter but it's not my favorite game, and Mega man doesn't appeal to me at all. I personally love love love DOA games. 
 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses. Beside you as you like softly down, I will be until I hear the words "Checkmate". ~Sebastian Michaelis ~ Individual 4 ~ A4's Greatest Villain <Right Here Lmao

 Hey~ Midget.
 What Capcom should do is PSN, XBLA, & Wii Store(Does it have a name?) for the 3 following titles Mega Man: Battle & Chase Mega Man: The Power Battle Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters Then maybe finally release something new in line with those games 
 Game is absolutely awful. 
 
 MegaMan should never be brought into a cross over, makes his reality make no sense. Plus he'd kick all the street fighters Arses
