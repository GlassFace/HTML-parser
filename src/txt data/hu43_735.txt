[Asian Music] K-pop Anyone?
 I love J-pop also but are there any k-pop fans here at all? There are a lot of really upbeat Korean music that I really love. Does anyone here like any K-pop songs? My favorite song/music video is Nu Abo by F(x) they are my favorite girl k-pop band. :3 If anyone likes any other K-pop singers/band please share <3 ^^ Here's the video for Nu Abo I hope you love it just as much as I do :3
