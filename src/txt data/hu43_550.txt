 How do you stay motivated??
 I exercise for health reasons, it keeps me feeling good after I'm done. After a few days of not doing anything at all, I'll feel low, down in the dumps and feel lazy. I hate that lazy feeling more than anything. It's so hot in Florida and I usually go swimming a lot of the time and during the fall and winter, I go bike riding or take a nice walk around the park. The park always has a nice view cause it's right near the river & I love being close to the water. Sometimes I even see ducks and I like watching the ducks go around the lake, lol. Plus it feels good to be outside, being inside for too long drives me absolutely crazy!
