[Action] Garo: Honoo no Kokuin (Garo: The Carved Seal of Flames)
 Garo: The Animation, titled in Japan as Garo -Honō no Kokuin- (牙狼〈GARO〉-炎の刻印-, Garo: The Carved Seal of Flames), is a Japanese anime series based on the Garo tokusatsu drama series. Yasuko Kobayashi, who serves as the series' main screenwriter, announced early on that it would feature a brand new set of characters unrelated to the main Garo continuity. The anime has been licensed for streaming in North America by Funimation. The story of the anime begins when the king's adviser launches a witch hunt, which endangers the Makai Knights and Makai Priests, who are supposed to protect people. A Makai Priest who has been condemned to die at the stake gives birth to a child, Leon Lewis. The child is rescued by his father, a Makai Knight, but never meets his mother. When he grows up he inherits the Gold Armor as a descendant of the Gold Knights. Meanwhile the king's adviser has taken over the country as the king has become ill, and Prince Alfonso has been driven out with his mother. He comes seeking the legendary Gold Knight in hopes of retaking his kingdom. For an action series, this looks and sounds really good! I'm excited to see him unleash these demonic powers that got the Makai Knights and Priests hunted down in the witch hunt!
