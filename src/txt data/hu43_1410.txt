[Romance] Meganebu! (Glasses Club)

The CDs revolved around a group of "ikemegane" (handsome eyeglasses-wearing) high school boys. Atsuko Nakajima (Hakuōki, Ranma ½) designed the characters for the drama CDs, and Chiaki Kon (director on Junjō Romantica, When They Cry - Higurashi, Makai Ōji: Devils and Realist) wrote the scenarios. (The drama CDs' website and Twitter account are no longer active.) The Niconico Live service will stream an unveiling of the anime production on July 12 at 7:30 p.m. (6:30 a.m. EDT). (Niconico's page for the event is not viewable outside Japan.) The anime's "Megane-bu" cast will appear at the Niconico Live event. Riding on the wave of Free! And here's the original news link with sprites of all the hot glasses boys for all you girls to preview: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news...air-in-october

 Haha I will be checking this out for realz 

 I finished the first episode...it was nothing special. And I am upset about it 

 I agree with sora. I feel like it's TRYING to be quirky. I found it so god awfully boring, I ended up falling asleep. I wasn't to impressed. I might give it another chance though. I do like the animation though.
