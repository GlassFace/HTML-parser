[Action] Hajime no Ippo Season 3 - Page 2
 http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news...nime-green-lit This year's 34th issue Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine is revealing on Wednesday that a third season of the television anime adaptation of George Morikawa's Hajime no Ippo (Fighting Spirit) manga has been green-lit. The anime is scheduled to begin airing this fall in Japan. The announcement image reads, “Ippo fights the formidable enemy, Sawamura! Dempsey breaks down!?” So apparently a season 3 has been confirmed and it will be airing this fall! I'm super excited for this as I've been waiting pretty much years after "New Challenger" Season 3 will be Ippo's challenge it seems. brb changing my name back to Takemura
