 Comic Con Birmingham, UK
 Mine had lots of stars signing autographs. Shatner was there but I didn't get his too pricey. Also they did have an anime viewing area. I didn't get to it. I was too pumped up getting ready for my shot with Ernie Hudson. Oh and lots and lots of comic book vendors. Movie props. Artists. The star wars 501st trooper gang . Withe movie props and costumes. And cosplayers! Yep even Asuna from sao was there! Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk
