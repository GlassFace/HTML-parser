[Anime] "Akame ga Kiru" Anime Confirmed
 The dark action fantasy manga Akame ga Kiru! gets a TV anime adaptation, announced by the February issue of Gangan Joker magazine. Akame ga Kiru! manga follows by Tatsumi, a fighter who sets off to the Capital in search of a way to make money to assist his poverty-stricken village in order to discover the deep corruption. He is taken in by a noble aristocratic girl by the name of Aria and recruited by Night Raid, a group of assassins who aim to eliminate corruption by mercilessly killing those responsible for it. Akame ga Kiru! (アカメが斬る!) is a Japanese shounen manga series written by Takahiro, illustrated by Tetsuya Tashiro, and serialised within the Weekly Gangan Joker published by Square Enix from 2010. A prequel manga by the title of Akame ga Kiru! Zero began serialisation within the Monthly Big Gangan in October 2013. I've been reading this manga since it's out and I have to say it's well done. Definitely looking forward to this. The character's developments are interesting and the pacing is good, though the plot is somewhat heavy. Beware of character deaths and uncensored gory action. Hopefully they will use the same drawing style as the manga in the anime. UPDATE: White Fox will be animating it.

 Wow that premise definitely sounds interesting. I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the post! 
 I nearly cried when I saw the title of this post. (Don't laugh >_>) I'm a huge fan of Akame Ga Kill and it has to be in my top 3 mangas, and I've always wanted it to become an anime. It's amazing, a reason being that the author doesn't tend to favor any side of the conflict, unlike pretty much every other battle manga out there. The 'good' guys lose and die just as much as the 'bad'. The author makes both sides of the conflict both out to be good and both out to be bad. (It kind of does that 'build up kill off' strategy used in Clannad and others if you know what I mean, which makes it really depressing at some parts). This manga has finally got the anime it has deserved. I'm so excited. But since I think its just been greenlighted, that means the anime won't be out for quite a while, maybe a year-ish depending on the situation. EDIT: Lol I just found this on crunchyroll on the page saying that the anime has been announced. The series follows a fighter from a poverty stricken village who falls in with a group of corrupting fighting assassins after being robbed upon arrival in the Capital. It's also notoriously violent, as Wikipedia Chronicles, featuring scenes of beheadings, characters having eyes gouged out, limbs broken and removed, torture, committing suicide by jumping, execution by boiling, characters having their faces sliced off, crucifixion, a pregnant woman being torn apart, and a woman being assaulted by a dog. Some info on the show xD EDIT 2: There also appears to be a prequel to the story from Akame's childhood in the empire, called "Akame Ga Kill! ZERO". Only 3 chapters out so far but still pretty good.

 Sounds worth a gander. I'm doing nothing for the next 2 hours so I'll just peek the manga whilst to pretending to do something useful on the net. Cheers. Is White Fox a good studio? Never heard of them. edit This is good. This is goooooooooooooood. Brilliant blend of Shounen tomfoolery and action with a pretty senin bow on top. Me gusta. Surprisingly gory and satrical in places. Yep, got all that from 1 chapter. From the synopsis Revive posted, I can tell the author is on top of his current and world affairs. Top stuff. Why doesn't anyone tell me about the good sh1t? Its always 1 Piece this and Attack On Kitten that.

White fox is the one who did Steins;Gate, hataraku maou sama, and the currently airing Super Sonico the animation. Not much of their works could be called masterpiece, but their animation quality is still top of the list nonetheless.

 HOLY %$&@ New Chap out today was epic. Best moment ever. SPOILER AHEAD Click only if you've read this chapter:  Spoiler  Spoiler I've always been rooting for Tatsumi x Mein. I was totally shocked that this actually happens. I was surprised, considering the main heroine is Akame. Best moment ever. *_*

 Ya I've been following it for awhile (in case some did'nt recognize my Avy atm lol) Seemed kinda Harem to this point in a way mostly, but The most recent chapter might correct that with Mein. My Fav Character since her introduction is Esdese, In case you couldent tell. lol. So ya. Looking forward to the next installment like everyone else. 
  Spoiler lol tatsumi x esdese would be hilarious, but her love is unrequited D: I was really expecting the Akame route, since almost all stories with romance have it between the mc and the main heroine. The Mein route was unexpected, but I like it since Mein is so kawaii >///> 

 Anyone remember that 23.5 special chapter? That was so sad, I just reread it. It made me tear up so much. Q_Q 

 That was the one with the (SPOILER ALERT) Country people being tortured for enjoyment right? Back to the love thing I was kindof rooting for Akame in the beginning and then Esdese out of necessity because I thought she would freeze the world if something bad happened to their relationship....I would suppose the Tatsumi X Mein route is kindof middle ground though because I cant imagine someone complaining about it...
