 Recent Gaming Purchases? - Page 3
 Note: Please discuss what games you've recently bought. I'll start us off ^_^. I ordered Saints Row 2 (PS3) for $23.52 New from Amazon.com today, it should arrive in my mailbox by Saturday hopefully. I just need Saints Row 4 now and then my Saints Row collection will be complete (not counting SR1 since that's Xbox 360 exclusive).
