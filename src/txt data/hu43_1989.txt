 I mean it was ok there was a bit of fighting and that is one of my fave zanpakto I seen to date and is so far the one I would choose for myself because im a puncher haha but ya rather boring cannot believe there is actually alot of boredom so far in the ending of bleach but im sure it will pick up soon once renji and kenpachi and ichigo and shinsui come out to play against the top quincy I image it will be crazy every week. seriously tho ichogo and kenpachi cannot wait 
 if they skip past and ignore the back store to kenpachi talking to his sword. Ima hate bleach forever. 100% of bleach fans and 100% of people who hate bleach We have been waiting for this since the first time we saw Kenpachi.

He likes to annoy the fans by pretending to forgot something that has been left off hanging and doesn't mentioned it again until 50 chapters after that. Duh.
