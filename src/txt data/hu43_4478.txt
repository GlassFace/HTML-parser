 New to anime
 I am new to anime so want some recommendations for a noobie like me. I have seen some but not much Here what I have seen: Dragonball Z (some episodes) One Piece (only first 5 episodes) RWBY (1st season, don't consider a full anime) YuYu Hakusho (half of first season) Saw these only because my friend watched them except RWBY but liked all of them. Also would like recommendations on some with girls as the main characters and some good mangas. Thanks, WOWFlipTV
