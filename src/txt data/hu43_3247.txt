 Shin Chan, cowboy bepop, and ranma 1/2
 This thread brings back so much nostalgia. I remember growing up and watching Inuyasha and Shin Chan on late night Adult Swim and go to school the next day. Those animes had a distinct flavor back in the 4th grade. 
 It was only a matter of time... Now I am one with the night and stars again... Thank you, Rhyme's Law, for your signature art work.
