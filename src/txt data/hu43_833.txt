[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 The first episode is good, but somehow not surprising. Sudden attacks, sudden mecha entrance by suddenly a pilot commoner. All of them seems to be a standard for mecha animes. But since I like mechas, so yeah, watching this.
