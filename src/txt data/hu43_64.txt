 Whats your daily excercise?
 No daily routine, however, I'm more on a weekly routine. Every Tuesday and Thursday, I do a 30 minute walk/jog/run. Every Saturday, it alternates between 3 miles and an increasing goal. Next week will be 9 miles. Last week was 7 miles. Around the end of September, I'll be alternating between the above Saturday routine and a weekend where I walk a distance on Saturday and run/jog/walk longer than a half-marathon on Sundays.
