[Mecha] Nobunaga the Fool
 Not sure what to think of this one. It basically seems to be the Oda Nobunga story set on a different planet with mecha. Doesn't thrill me, but the artwork looks good! Especially judging by Google Images, we might be in for some stunning scenery, though the plot sounds a little uninspired to me.
