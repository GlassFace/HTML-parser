[Anime] School Days = Great!?
 how could you guys have wanted him to end up with the "tutor". I totally agree wesley and karnage. Death was the most satisfying way the anime could have ended i think. The show was so bad, but I give them props because they were probably aiming to make the audience hate the main charc. and they achieved it. WELL DONE! never have I ever wanted an anime charc. to be so dead and they delivered!
