 Yeah It seems like both 10 and 11 were building up to next weeks episode. But If Mikasa is dead...welll I just dont know anymore. 

 I saw that ending coming from a mile away. I'm really enjoying it though. Twists like this make it enjoyable to watch.

 Yep, great episode even if some of those speeches got dragged out a bit. Really like Pixis, they've done a great job adapting him from the manga and his VA is nailing it. 

  Spoiler HE TRIED TO PUNCH MIKASA! HE CAN'T CONTROL IT!!!!! The next episode is going to be awesome! any other thoughts?

 This anime is full of win. Even the opening is epic in everything.

The next episode is going to be awesome! any other thoughts?  Spoiler Him losing control was easy to caught on to with the foreshadowing. Eren talks about how for the commander to go through with the operation, he must too must also understand that the titans aren't their only enemy. Also the whole fact that Eren's father kept the titan elixir a secret was clue enough that Eren's transformation could equally be a curse on mankind as much as it was a blessing.

  Spoiler Thought it was funny, Erin was all passion with that glare of purpose and destiny, "I'm gonna move that bolder! I WILL MOVE IT for humanity!" Then punches Mikasa. 
 ROFL. That ending was hilarious. Pretty sure they didn't just kill off a main character, but then again, with this show, you just never know.

 Any clue how many cour the anime is going to be? The pace it's going it's definitely not 1,but 2 doesn't seem like it'll have a good place to stop after reading the Manga... 
 @ShikinamiDesu You can also find me on Hummingbird! 
 Think it's 2 cour with the second half coming in the fall. 

 Please forgive me for being stupid but what does cour mean, I have never seen that word before or heard it.
