[Mystery] Death Parade
 Madhouse Studios " Welcome to Queen Dekim" What greets two unsuspecting guests is a strange bar, Queen Dekim, and the white-haired bartender, Dekim. "From here you two shall begin a battle where your lives hang in the balance," he says to introduce the Death Game. Before long the guests' true natures become apparent. As a matter of course, at the game's end Dekim is revealed to be the "arbiter." Dekim's judgement on the two guests is...

 Ah, Madhouse. One of my favorites. However the storyline seems shady.

 I saw Death Billiards a few weeks back and loved it. I didn't even know this was coming out. If this series is anything like that one off episode, it shall be awesome!

("El. Psy. Congroo.")  Spoiler 
 Sounds awesome! Definitely on my list!

 Well the first episode seemed interesting... 
  Spoiler "If the king does not lead, how can he expect his subordinates to follow?"
 I really liked the first ep. It was ****ed up. I think this show had a lot of potential. 
 Dang, the first episode was boss, definitely looking forward to the rest of the series. 
("El. Psy. Congroo.")  Spoiler 
 So...the point of the game is to see who goes to heaven and who goes to hell. Good game but it kind of screwed with us this first episode.

 This is an interesting concept, sounds like Danganronpa to me. I will give this a try together with Assassination Classroom. Is there no love for sports anime in this forum? Hahahaha. :P

 Unsure whether it'll fit the show in the long run or not, but I can't stop watching that blasted op.  Spoiler

 The bartender looks like Ginko from Mushishi and that OP was excellent. I am watching this anime now. 
 Gotta love the variety of Madhouse stories. I have this on my ptw list. Might give it a try sometime when it's out.

 At first I thought it would be like "Jigoku Shoujo" type where an episode can stand alone on it own (different story of people each episode) Well, I really enjoyed the first episode and will be looking out for more ;D

I thought it was going to be episodic until I saw the little sigment after the ending song 
 Thank god the process was explained... The first episode a left some unanswered questions, but to my great joy they were answered in episode two. Poor woman went to the void while being innocent and hurt by the person she loved (T.T) soo sad...

 I don't think it was completely proved she was innocent. It seemed there was still some uncertainty, which I don't get because they should know since they have her memories. But either way you look at it she did cheat, so I don't feel too bad for her

But either way you look at it she did cheat, so I don't feel too bad for her I think they only get their memories and not feelings that's why they didn't know and that's why the new girl is there... I think Decim can't read feelings so that's why the new girl was brought there to help him make a better judgement. Also Decim said that he made a mistake by sending the woman to the void. Maybe the woman did cheat but she regreted it and the baby was her husbands. She really loved him, but the guy just didn't trust people and was really jealous. He was the cause of the crash so he basically killed them so in my opinion he was supposed to go to the void.

 This's gonna be a cynical series. Reminding me of Hell girl Oh and iirc I saw this the first time couple years ago at Young animator contest or what not. But its called Death billiard then

He was the cause of the crash so he basically killed them so in my opinion he was supposed to go to the void. That right there. She is an assistant. But the other girl told her to keep doing what she was doing. I think you are correct and she has to become the balance of our bartender. There is obviously a flaw in the fact that judgement can be passed with possible accidents. I totally enjoy this, but I have to admit, I enjoyed the mystery of the unsolved nature in the title. That said, it would become way to formulaic, and I do agree the creators have done justice to making Death Billiards a full fledged series. Now let's hope the wheels do not fly off as the show progresses. 
 
 Just watched ep 3, and I'm not really sure where this show is heading. It was a watchable episode but it didn't progress the series any farther and the ending was inconclusive. 
 I think what the latest episode (3) does is present the possibility that the outcome can be different.  Spoiler having a dual reincarnation was good, because at least there is the possibility that not 50% of people do not make the grade. Now, I will think that the show is going to show an episode where both contestants are bad, and both will go to the void. 
 
 Well I'm glad to see that it's not all chaos with the show, I'm glad to see a good outcome rather then the same one good one bad, so it's goes without saying I'm looking forward to the duel void if it happens.

 Now that work's eased up a bit, I finally had a chance to watch 2 & 3. Ep2 disappointed me a little, as I feel they might be giving too much away too early on. I know it helped establish The Woman's character, but I also question whether it was really necessary to underscore the  Spoiler possibility that Machiko sacrificed herself as, from reading the reactions online, I think most folk reached that conclusion on their own. Presumably my guess that The Woman is Machiko reincarnated is also now out of the window. I liked Ep3 more though.  Spoiler Based on the previous two episodes, I was gritting my teeth in anticipation of something horrible, which made it all the more surprising when it didn't happen. Was it ever actually stated that both characters were sent for reincarnation though? I got the impression that the result was unchanged and (presumably) Mai went to the void. Still finding it hard to judge whether the show has much substance to it at the moment, but it's stylish and a bit novel.
