 Beating is the New way of Loving?
 All she has done is essentially put into writing what most women in abusive relationships think. You have always seen the girl with the guy who hurts them and you wonder why she stays with him. Other than fear of turning him in it is because of what this woman stated. They can start to rationalize the abuse as tough love. The human mind will attempt to rationalize any behavior and this is no different. My guesses is that she didn't have very high self-esteem before the relationships. And because of the low self-esteem, she may have blamed herself for the abuse, rationalizing that he was hitting her only because she had stepped out of her assigned place. It's sad that people think like this, especially one so young who has a whole life ahead of her. I can only hope she eventually makes a heel turn and realizes that some guys are just abusive *******s who she needs to drop like a wet newspaper the moment they use physical force to enforce their will over hers. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
