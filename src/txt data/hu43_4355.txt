[Image] Girlfriend or Beard... Which do you choose?
 I don't mind beards. I've never dated anyone who grew out their facial hair though beyond a mustache. I do find when it starts growing out that I feel discomfort with kissing, but I have super sensitive skin. :s I don't think it'd be a deal breaker for me if a guy had a full beard though. I'm not the biggest fan of facial hair personally, but I know girls who like it or don't mind it. And really, I'm not going to let facial hair be the decider of whether or not to keep a relationship going. haha For me, it'd just be hard to be intimate with someone who has facial hair because my skin breaks out.
