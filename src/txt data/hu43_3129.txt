 The Official Free Rice Thread
 I'm on board with this and if we're allowed friendly competition I'm just putting it out there that my goal for the moment is to get at least 1000 rice a day, so that's 100 questions answered correctly. My name on the site is ShadowAdam if anyone wants to challenge me with something more xD
