 Suggestions for Drama/Romance
 So I watched If her flag breaks that yoda suggested. Was good and enjoyable. Also watched Kaichou wa maid-sama which was really good. Best one I have watched this year. Tried to start toradora. Watched 1st episode and gonna take a little break from it at least. You guys who have watched it, was it hard for you to endure aisaka at start? I didn't like her character one bit or the way Ryuuji reacted to her whimsys. I felt like watching was a bit of torture. Will it change more in future, because like based on the first episode I don't feel like continuing watching at all, but then again it's really popular and often recommended in one's that I have liked although this does not seem to be anything like Sakurasou, Myself ; Yourself or True tears. Ps. Is it possible for someone to move this to right section? Didn't know at the time I made this that there were own section for suggestions inside review section thus I thought this would be right place for the topic. My appologies! ^^
