[Personal Life Discussions] What skill/talent do you wish you had
 Play any instrument. It would be nice to actually be able to make music rather than just appreciate music. Be able to draw well and frequently. I can draw fairly well, but I can only draw from what already is (I cannot make anything new) and it takes me days to get it to look perfect. There are individuals online who can create new ideas and draw them better than I can in only a few hours. Speak another language. Hell, it would be nice to speak and know several languages. If I could, I would want to be fluent in Spanish, German, and Russian. Everything else would be secondary. Be witty. My mother's side of the family is very witty and fast with their humor. My father's side is slow with theirs. I have the wit, but the slow reaction time. I wish I possessed the fast reaction time. Have more confidence. I have some confidence, but not as much as I would wish. I have seen individuals with intense confidence be able to get away with anything. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
