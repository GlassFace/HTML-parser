 A Very Tsundere Hatsune Miku...
 Just got into visual novels and i eventually made the discovery of a VN series based of the vocaloid Hatsune Miku. Its called "Mirai no Kimi to Subete no Uta ni". May i just say, Hatsune Miku portrayed in this visual novel is ADORABLE ヽ(*≧ω≦)ﾉ There is also a sequel to this called "Rin ga Utau, Mirai no Neiro", where Hatsune Miku makes her return with her sister, Kagamine Rin... Though I've yet to read through the sequel, they (as in the first one) is quite entertaining to read.
