[Manga] Ubel Blatt (Evil Blade)
 I've heard f it but wasn't very interested till now. To me it sounded like a poor man's Berserk but your comments as well as the references to ASOIAF which is probably my favourite fantasy series after Malazan makes me very intrigued about this series. Edit: just checked it out. Only the first two volumes have been released thus far making it even more tempting for me to get into it. Will probably pick up somehwere this year. Thanks for the rec!
