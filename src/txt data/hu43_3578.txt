 Vegeta vs Hulk!
 The fact remains that the Hulk has destroyed at least one planet I know of (and that was just from an indirect clash with someone else), and has many times over survived blows capable of destroying planets, among many other ridiculous things. Vegeta got choked out by a hairless space tranny and failed to kill an evil blob of bubble gum with the most powerful attack he's ever used in his most powerful form. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
