Just sad and pathetic that a foot of snow can't fall without people completely losing their ****. I sat here with a 12 case and my computer, it was a great storm. hahahahaha. this made me laugh so much. It's almost like some grand marketing scheme to get people to buy **** by scaring them shitless don't you think? Not trying to sound like a crazy conspiracy theory guy or whatever.

I was just saying in general it wasn't really a response to just you, just me ranting haha. I know it was WAY worse up north. My sister lives in boston and got ****in swamped, so I don't blame the news for telling people to take precautions then. But where I live and Jellz, people were literally acting like this was Sandy part 2 and that was just ridiculous.

OT - Yeah, after Sandy and the follow up storm, you would figure the "oh crap" tactic would be worn out for this year in the NYC area. Combine slow news day and a surplus of snow shovels and salt = massive blizzard. Although when I lived back in NJ, almost every storm was treated the same way. When only 20% of the time did the storm actually amount to anything for us. Nothing like getting a storm warning for a foot of snow, then waking up to 2 inches and having to walk to school, or drive to work ( depending on age ). 
 In the NYC area, Sandy severely affected mostly Staten Island, Long Island & coastal Queens. Those are the places that are still sensitive. Where I live, In the middle of Queens, Sandy and this blizzard was actually fun...

 I guess it isn't extremely horrible here but it is bad. I live in the middle of Michigan, the snow is up to me knees here and about no one here can drive. The roads are extremely slippery, just today there was two cars stuck in a ditch on my road and three other cars that almost went in, and I live out in the middle of no where on a DIRT road. Meaning other places have way more issues. School was canceled both Friday and tomorrow and it just keeps getting worse.

 Originally Posted by MyaMeOhMy What's it like over there in Connecticut? Some drifts are like as high up as shoulders, the average height is around the waist. The sun has shrunk it a bit, but it's thick and getting icy. My road is still unplowed. And I live in the middle of a congested coastal I-95 corridor suburb, not out on a backroad in a hill town.

 Yeah I think this is the most snow I have ever seen in this part of CT where I live. Being right on the coast the amount we got is pretty nuts. 
 
 I'm living in Danbury Connecticut currently, roads have all cleared up, mail is back on track, and it's sort of misty, foggy air. Snow isn't too bad, high, but not impossible to move through. 

 I'm just outside Boston. 28 inches on the ground but the drifts were an easy 6 feet. The driving ban did go into effect and I'm actually glad it happened or I would've had to go to work Friday night in the middle of it. Took 4 hours for me and my brother to shovel out the sidewalk and driveway. Wound up doing it with a smile, though, watching the guy across the street throw his 5-year-old kid into an 8-foot pile of snow we built on the sidewalk. I can't speak for other towns but mine is still under a snow emergency, meaning that you can't park on the even numbered side of the street, and since you'll be linched if you try to take a spot someone shoveled out, that means you don't get to park your car. The city has started the process of snow removal (as opposed to plowing) to open up some parking spots, but it's a slow process. Yesterdays rain did help clear the snow off the area you drive in on the streets but it froze overnight so we get to drive on an ice-skating rink today. Just another winter day in NE.

They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them.

 Hey a chance to throw barbs at each other... The storm is over, and so is this thread.
