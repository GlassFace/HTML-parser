 An Anime I watched many years ago...
 Ok, so I watched quite a bit of anime as a kid with my older brother, I'm still into it which is why I'm here, but there's one particular anime I remember watching but I cannot remember the title of it or the plot. All I remember is a single scene, and if anybody could find the anime in question I'd be super grateful. Pretty sure it was an anime movie, not a tv show. But the scene is two guys about to battle. One of the guys (the bad guy?) is dressed in a mostly white outdit, standing on a grey stone floor with his back to a partially destroyed grey stone wall, and there's a lightning storm going on while this is happening. I think the bad guy used a sword. I watched this when I was a kid, so it was twenty years ago or more. EDIT: Oh, I live in the UK, if that helps.
