 My Idea for a Naruto Movie
 Hello boys, you may not know this about me but I am an aspiring screenwriter. I wish to lead big cocaine snorting life in Hollywood with two dozen Asian brides. As you know I love anime and want to get the big hitters like naruto on the big screen so it can take over our decadent American culture. so this is my pitch for a Naruto movie. I've posted it elsewhere but feel it needs more exposure to you blokes. Naruto Nicolas Cage plays John Naruto, a thirty something weed smoking slacker down on his luck, clad in an orange leather jumpsuit he got at a whitesnake concert. He is hassled by street thug gangsters Gaara Gaylord (Ron Jeremy in his major motion picture acting debut) and Tony Ten Ten (David Schwimmer) and must pay back his weed debts to them or be killed. But just when his luck is about to run out, mysterious rapping ninja Sasuke (Snoop Dogg, who will record all new tracks specifically for the film) and hot ninja bounty hunter Sakura (Hillary Swank) rescue him from danger and inform him that he is the chosen one, destined to avenge his mysteriously dead parents and save the world from the evil Red Cloud Party, led by nefarious nazi transvestite and Sasuke's long lost brother Madara (David Hasselhoff). To do so, he must train on the mysterious ninja island and unlock his inner ninja. Can he be a real human bean and save us all? Hope to get these babies funded by Rick Santorum's new faith based company EchoLight Studios. Thoughts?
