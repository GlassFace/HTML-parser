[Futuristic] Ghost in the Shell Arise
 Kazuchika Kise, Tow Ubukata to serve as the chief director, head writer. The February issue of Kodansha's Monthly Young Magazine is announcing on Wednesday that the Ghost in the Shell Arise anime will launch in 2013. Kazuchika Kise will serve as the chief director, and Tow Ubukata is supervising and writing the series scripts. According to IEEE802.11, Monthly Young Magazine also revealed Cornelius as the composer and a piece of visual art for the main character Motoko Kusanagi. http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news...launch-in-2013 Wish it was a third season of Stand Alone Complex instead but still kinda neat. The lack of Yoko Kanno involvement tempers my interest though. 

 No Yoko Kanno? im really disappointed about that but new Ghost in the Shell material is always good news

 I'm curious, but well see how it turns out. If the little piece of the above illustration is supposed to be Motoko...seems like a standard illustration style, not really grabbing me. It kind of makes her look a bit younger as well. I hope this isn't GITS the angsty teen dumbed down android version.

 Full shot: I don't get the feeling she's meant to be younger, think it's just a different direction with her character design. I mean hell, we've seen the Major in a few different bodies, always the same personality. 

 If you have seen the movies she ends up in a younger body so if this is her after leaving Section 9 this could be pretty sweet. 
 Production I.G. has been really sketchy lately. The failure of many well promoted shows from them just makes me not want to watch this. And as mentioned above, the lack of Yoko Kano is definitely not a good sign either, but I am going to approach this with an open mind after all. Hopefully the VA cast isn't being tampered with.

 Yoko Kanno plssss. Stahhhp. Not gonna watch it until I see the reception it receives. 
 Hey~ Midget.
 I'm failing to see how not having Yoko Kano is such a bad thing I mean her music for the past GITS stuff has been good but she isn't the only musician and plenty of series and movies out there have good music not done by her. 
 I dunno, I'd say she's probably the best composer in that industry. It's kind of like how the fourth HP movie suffered pretty heavily from the lack of John Williams. Maybe you don't notice the music as much, but the quality of the orchestration and scoring can really make or break a show for me. But yeah, can't judge how this will be without her, just I've pretty much enjoyed anything she's scored because of the quality she brings. It would've been a good sign for me to see her name on the list. 

 Guess I'll wait till the series gets on Toonami to watch it. Ghost in the Shell never really interested me.

 Oh, this is a series? I heard Ghost in the Shell and thought another movie... I would be interested in watching this!

 I can't wait to watch this. Anything GiTS is a must watch. Oh sh*t, and Tow Ubukata as head writer is a really, really, really good sign.

 Im very skeptical because the even switched the director apparently. it's not even the same series name anymore. I guess it's too early to assume things but it needs to come out fast so it can make me stop wondering. 
 Well, Motoko looks ugly as ****, but I'll reserve judgement until after seeing it. Even attempting to judge the series (or just the general style of it) based on her design is pointless due to Motoko's always-unique style, so I won't bother. But yes, totally lame that Kanno's not on board. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 She is not that ugly, but yeah nowhere near as attractive as before

 What? Not down with the flowbee? However, yeah that was what I was referring to before. Just based on the image, it feels so different than the prior established versions of Motoko. Maybe it will be fine, maybe not. For now though I can't really say I like the visual direction they took here so far. She def does not look "bad a$$". Just looks like some emo 20 yr old in a bad Kaneda outfit. 
 Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehano. First of, am I the only one who thinks the biggest indicator of 'erm....nah' is perhaps the fact that Kenji Kamiyama is not involved in this in any shape or form? I mean, I like Techno when I'm in the mood but seriously, thats the biggest concern you people have? This just reeks of what happened when we got the Blood+ series. Blood: The Last Vampire was basically turned into what everyone on here seems to lap up. Mediocre, generic as **** anime eating of proven ownage. I'll prolly check the first few episodes, namely to see whats going on with her crotch in that image. Also, for those that haven't seen Solid State Sociaty, you need to sort it out. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Oh Snap you have provided the greatest reason for my to lose hope and that is equating it to Blood+ and Blood: The Last Vampire becuase Blood: The Last Vampire is great and Blood+ **** all over it and gave us some pile of garbage that had mass appeal since the mass has no ****ing mind of its own. I never even bothered with Blood C or what ever the Clamp one was called though kinda curious about it. Enough about that I will give this a shot if/when I can/remember but now my hopes have been crushed by Oh Snap. I didn't really like GITS:SAC or Innocence that much SAC becuase it just seemed like a generic show for so much of it and Innocence I think in part for the lack of the Major. I do really like the original movie, not the shitty blu-ray with new and old animation cut together, and Solid State Society. I might want to look at the compressed GITS:SAC stuff as I think there are versions of it out there that cuts out a lot of episodes or something. 
 i always liked the other ghost in the shell it had a very nice war setting i was always in to war in anime. so its a spin off series that can be good or bad because the spin off series could be either better or worse than the original series. it all depends on if ghost in the shell arise has a manga its based off and if its ganna follow that storyline. but since its a ghost in the shell series i think it will atleast be decent.

 aHA! Perfect time to pop the question! I have yet to watch GiTS, basically because i'm too stupid to figure out the order to watch them (SAC, SSS, Innocence) and if they're all worth it, and which ones are to be watched as series or movies. However, I'd like to catch up before giving Arise a try since GiTS is such an iconic franchise. Could someone take the time to educate me on the path to take up to this new release??

In order: Ghost in the Shell (1995 Movie) Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd G.i.G. Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex: Solid State Society Skip the sh*t out of Innocence, the second movie. It's garbage. So you've got two movies and about 50ish episodes of anime to watch. Time to get crackin.

 There is no right path per say. Both movies would be considered non canon to the tv series, although they share many similarities. The issue tends to be timeline conflicts though. So you can watch the movies apart from the tv series with no comprehension issues on what is going on. For the tv series it is: SAC 1 and 2 SSS The 1st movie gives you a nice primer for the tv series, the second movie is a bit more out there, and tends to get a bit too lost in its own philosophical diving. So up to you if you want to watch the tv series or the movies first. 
 The second movie was navel-gazing tripe, don't bother with it.
