If you expand your horizons and read up more on all the different viewpoints that so many have written on what would happen and how people would react in a post-apocalyptic world, you would find the viewpoints to be DRASTICALLY different, often opposing each other. Not all of it I will agree with, and many of their scenarios differ from what I would personally believe myself. Nonetheless, they are all very well-researched, and often draw on real-life examples of human behavior in some of our worst tragedies such as blockades, wars, natural disasters, etc. Yet even with all that mass pondering and research, nobody has yet been able to conclusively decide on how humans would react to such a disaster. You however, seem to have it all figured out. In this case we are seeing just one of the many depictions of human behavior under high-pressure; giving in to the mania.... and making many bad decisions as a result. That is just one way of interpreting how humans could "realistically react" in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but it is still a valid viewpoint.

 I don't need to have lived through that to understand that people are living under duress and are in a high stress situation. That doesn't excuse poor writing like the girls being in high schooler outfits, being mostly unarmed, supposedly having undergone years of training but making absolutely idiotic mistakes that anyone with an ounce of commonsense wouldn't make. The main characters have been put into a position where the viewer is led to believe they're professionals but they never demonstrate anything but absolutely awful decision making and poor choices. It isn't that people making poor decisions under stress is unbelievable, it's the fact that really obvious and melodramatic choices have been written that lead to completely unbelievable results. It's the sum of the decisions because the author tried to create tension through much too obvious means and without actually considering the setting or the characters he's put into these situations. It's why I said the first couple episodes so far have been funny and silly more than dramatic and poignant, even though the author was obviously going for the latter. He's failed to accomplish creating believable narratives in each of the situations he's set up because of the details involved in each of the stories so far or simply ignored established narrative he already created in order to raise the tension. But when he's done that it only resulted in melodrama because it wasn't a believable choice. 

 I was facepalming at some of the things that they did in episode two, but I think that their decisions in episode three were pretty solid. They could also totally drop the high school uniforms and give them body armor and some rifles instead of a shitty .22. As far as the whole doll metaphor goes, I think they could cut it out entirely and lose nothing of value. The fact that they owe their existence to a nuclear incident that killed millions of people is enough of a cross to bear. Grappling with that fact is going to get you farther than some identity crisis about being dolls in terms of drama. It would also allow for a less shitty title to. All of that being said, I still want to see more. I like this show, and hopefully it gets better. :3

 Yeah I do think ep 3 was an improvement but jesus 2 was so bad. I don't feel like I got across well enough how dumb the showdown was, because not only were all of the character actions involved in the scene unbelievable, but the building collapsing made literally all of that character build up completely meaningless. It took the human drama and choices made during that exchange out of the equation instead replacing the established tension with a natural force. It was such an unbelievably poor writing decision. The entire point of that showdown was about the human choices being made but hey no, suddenly we're going to have the building collapse to so those choices are made entirely moot and make the prior scene utterly meaningless. Completely ruined the dramatic set up and took the air out of the scene, which wasn't great to begin with. 

 Preview for Episode 5 promises to be beautiful! I can't wait to see what the survivors have done...

Did you guys totally miss the whole point of the girls being there to SAVE survivors who are in need of rescue after a disaster? They're not there to eliminate enemies with massive firepower, and nothing makes the protagonist Ibara sadder than letting somebody die. There are no enemies or foes to them, only victims. Would you send a doctor or a missionary into a war-torn or isolated area armed to the teeth with a full military arsenal, or just with basic knowledge of self-defense? This is not a video game Ian, so please stop comparing it to such. You are missing the entire story with your rants. We get that you don't like the show, so you can leave further trolling aside. Yes, you already "got across well enough how dumb" you think the show is. We get how much you hate it, and continuing to rant about how shitty you think it is only distracts from the purpose of this thread.

 If I'm sending a doctor or a missionary into a war-torn or isolated area, I'm giving them at least some firepower to deal with the local fauna. I'm also expecting they understand basic survival tactics. I never compared it to a video game. There's very basic rules of writing the show is failing to adhere to in terms of the narrative it's establishing each episode and keeping to what it has already established previously. Then the amount of problems being piled on, in an effort to make it more dramatic, only causes it to seem hilarious to me as a viewer. It'd be like someone trapped in a burning house with a firefighter coming in. But then wait! The house is also haunted, and it's collapsing! Like, the extraneous dramatic tension being introduced in a f*cking nuclear disaster area is wholly unnecessary. You don't need to have the building collapsing when you've already introduced a time sensitive aspect to the plot with the girls breathing tank being smaller/having less air. That doesn't make the scene more impactful and it ruins the human element and decision you just achieved through dialogue. You don't need to kill off both parents by having them written so poorly that they make every possible decision that leads to their daughter being orphaned through sheer stupidity. The girl seems like she's better off and safer now not surrounded by the two most inept fictional adults ever created. Anywho like I said earlier in the thread, I think ep 3 was a massive improvement even if it still had some writing issues. I've only been so critical because I really do like the setting and concept, and even find the artstyle going on in it quite nice with the scenic overgrown backdrops.Hopefully this weeks episode is even better so I don't feel compelled to complain about it!

It's okay to voice your own opinion, but please don't lie about what you've said. And again, you're totally missing the entire point of the anime. They are not "highly trained experts" for just combat. This isn't a show about combat, or fighting, or survival of the fittest through a post-apocalyptic hell. Did you notice that the world is not doomed, but rather only one city is contaminated? You rant and rant about how the show fails to meet up with your expectations but your expectations are for a completely different show which Coppelion is not. Which is fine... this obviously is not the show you're looking for. So you should move on then, and not waste your energy and our sanity with your endless rants about how much you hate the show. It's not the post-apocalyptic survival and fighting show that you're looking for, but you're the only one who needs it to be that. Let the rest of us enjoy the show for what it is - as wrought with bad decisions and self-induced peril as it is. Nobody's arguing that those things are not present in the storyline, but we aren't necessarily complaining about it. That is the way the writers had meant for the anime to play out. Not every story is told the same way. You get upset when we say anything that's not positive about an anime or character you love, and won't quit bashing an anime that you hate. It's unnecessary. There are so many different anime of so many types and genres for just that reason - to account for everyone's varied tastes. Most of them are not "great" or "terrible" like you categorize them, they are either for you or not for you. That doesn't make them good or bad. I know many are following this show and are moved by its storyline. We would like to freely discuss what we watch, rather than having to trudge through pages full of hate and bashing.

 Oh jesus dude, I didn't mean in that regard. Yeah I compared the settings because they're incredibly similiar but that has nothing to do with what you're attacking my opinion for. The writing problems in this story are unrelated to STALKER being a video game. They literally said in the story, they've trained for years for this. The entire reason they were grown out of somatic cells was as a tool for the government for dealing with the nuclear disaster. I mean it was expressly stated in the show. That you think an opposing opinion is hateful bashing is laughable and no one has to respond to what I'm posting. I have yet to attack anyone's opinion in this thread I've simply defended my own after you got personally offended that I pointed out writing flaws within the narrative. You should probably reread the thread if your view of what has happened is so distorted that you think my posts were the problem. EDIT: I haven't tried to convince you or anyone of anything. Holy sh*t. I posted an opinion, you attacked it, I defended it ad nauseam. I'm cool with not having more back and forth but I'm going to keep talking about the episodes as they come out. vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

The writing problems in this story are unrelated to STALKER being a video game. Alright, I can accept that. I accept that you have your own reasons for not liking the story and I certainly don't expect nor would try to persuade you otherwise. So could you please just leave the subject alone then, and not continue on trying to to convince us as to why this anime is so terribly written, dumb, and stupid? Originally Posted by Ian the Korean EDIT: I haven't tried to convince you or anyone of anything. Holy sh*t. I posted an opinion, you attacked it, I defended it ad nauseam. Wow. I can't believe you actually said that. My response to you was that each individual had a reason for "wandering around in hazmat suits", or more aptly for staying in the old capital, and that the a big part of the anime was exploring each of those reasons. How the hell was that an attack on your opinion? Originally Posted by Ian the Korean I'm cool with not having more back and forth but I'm going to keep talking about the episodes as they come out. Sure, as long as you can come up with something more meaningful than "Man this shows dumb", then we can all discuss the show civilly together.

  Spoiler I love how the fourth episode had the girls looking 'save' the professor even though they knew that he was going to be captured and detained. Also wtf is up with the girls searching for him after taking down the bomber. He was obviously trying to run away from them and they call his name like he's going to answer. "I'm running away to die but here I am!!!!" lol 
 Plane fight and chase scene was cool even if it was pretty silly. Confused why they picked a B-2 for some kind of low flight battle like that, it's a supersonic plane it wouldn't even be able to maintain flight at the speed of a car. It's not some kind of cargo plane either although I guess it could handle 50 gallon drums in it's bomb compartments. Really weird choices. I guess the author likes that particular plane or something. Episode felt kinda disjointed, lot of odd cuts. Just some weird direction going on there, like they removed some scenes around the middle of the episode. Felt smoother once they caught up to the professor at the shrine but the countdown timer was so ridiculous and silly. The ending was really dumb and silly too with the aether drop off, but I guess it's about what I should've expected. The vice principal forgiving him was pretty great though! It's a shame the entire cast is suicidal, must really make the girls job a b*tch.

He was only hiding out in the wastelands and trying to die because of his guilty conscious. They will only detain him to learn his knowledge. The girls are not doing him harm by bringing him in, they are merely saving him from his own suicidal tendencies. Originally Posted by Ian the Korean It's a shame the entire cast is suicidal, must really make the girls job a b*tch. Yup, totally agree with that. :P 
Ned Yeung, A.C.E. cyclopsphoto.ca 
 If they only wanted to learn from him why would they use the detain and capture wordings? Shouldn't they just have said to find him and talk to him. Detain and capture really does not feel very positive to me. O well, its not the most annoying thing about the anime so its cool.

It just feels silly and melodramatic instead of tragic and eerie. Why would they even name them "Coppelion" and then tell us that it literally means "dolls." The writing is so ham-fisted in trying to create existential turmoil for the girls. Well, just updated to episode 6 - still no epic, out-of-the-world action which makes me feel thrilled and think 'wow, holy mother fudge cakes *eyes bulging*. Aoi - not to be too extreme - seems like the most useless and annoying character in this series, is she a bait for trouble? I need someone to eliminate her, because even though she's the kind, funny happiness (I'm guessing) tinge in the serious, she's someone I want to slap a couple of times. Just a couple of times.

Um... when was it ever said that this was supposed to be a high-action anime? Even going off just the description before the anime even aired, it was classified as "drama" (see the title of this thread). You're looking for oranges in an apple bin, yet you appear surprised that you aren't finding any oranges.

 Interesting. Along the top is the Coppelion ED, along the bottom are scenes from Tsukuyomi Moon episode 17.
