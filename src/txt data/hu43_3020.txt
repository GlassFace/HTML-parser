 Feminist games critic cancels talk after terror threat
 I'm mostly just lost as to why anyone cares about video game journalism, much less integrity or ethics in video game journalism since it's never existed. Video game "journalism" has never been more than a mouth piece for the industry giants to peddle their AAA games. I guess I also have trouble giving too much of a damn about whether or not Sarkeesian et al. are harming the feminist movement when the only people concern trolling about that are privileged white males using it as an excuse to launch attacks on feminism and progressivism. I have yet to see any of the numerous gamergate advocates bemoaning those women actually do anything constructive; it's just lots of slandering and seems to be nothing more than an excuse to continue being misogynistic pieces of trash.
