 Game of Thrones
 This thread has spoilers! I'm just curious to see who everyone is rooting for to win the iron throne. A lot of people will say House Stark which I find funny seeing as Rob has declared the North a separate kingdom. However I do like the Starks and the people of the North and I hope they win their independence. The house i root for is house Baratheon! and not those nasty inbred Lannister children who claim to be Baratheons, I'm talking about Stannis Baratheon! Stannis really won me over when he was the first one on shore in the invasion of king's landing and the first one up the ladder. I think he really is the best material to be king. 

 season 3 for this just airing, I would love to see the little man becomes king!

 Interesting that you're rooting for Stannis, as his character was designed to be unlovable. I personally loved the first two episodes so far, and I think this is going to be the best season yet. I know what's going to happen, but it'll be interesting to see how it unfolds on the show, especially since the show does intend to deviate from the books this season more than the previous two. ^^ Anyway, the actor who plays Brann has changed quite noticeably, hehe ^__^

 At least Stannis has some personality in the tv show. And by personality I mean awkward hilarity. Everytime he said something in the deadpan way of his caused me to laugh uncontrollably. He's very close to joining Dany and Catelyn as the characters who's parts I skip in the books. Anyway, great first episode and that was one big and very badass dire wolf. Damn. And I wish I was up to date with the books. The urge to 'Snape killed Sean Bean' this joint is unbearable.

 Currently working my way through book 3, so I probably won't watch this season until I'm around halfway through (the span of this season), or just get around to it after I've finished the book. As for who I support...Targaryen, but not Daenerys...

I really enjoy his character and he is one of my favorite starks. Do you have a favorite to win the iron throne?

 I wanna root for someone from the Dorne. Plus House Martell sound like a decent, albit overpriced cognac. Or Brann somehow coming to the fore. Starks are easily the closest thing to the good guys in this series, lol. I also think Jon Snow isn't Neds bastard. Shame Mance isn't being played by Viggo Mortensen, but going with mostly unknowns has worked wonders so far. I'm way more interested in stuff beyond the wall than the actual game outside of Iron Isles revolt against the Starks. Also, its a shme we can't have more scenes with Arya and Tywin. Charles Dance and that kid killed it. As for who I support...Targaryen, but not Daenerys... They pretty much had it coming, unless there's revelations in the book 3? Feel BAD for the kids and wife the Lannisters murdered but thats about it.

No, not from book 3. I spoiled myself a bit about the existence of a future character, or rather, his continued existence.

 Cheers. I always wanted to know who'd steal Danys eggs next. Damn, this joke works on a number of levels and I can't even bring myself to finish book 2!

XD Hmm, nah, I dunno if I'm necessarily rooting for anyone, per se. I have characters I like and dislike, but I honestly can't answer who I'd wanna see as ruler of the seven kingdoms. ^^ I thought the exchange between Olenna, Margaery, and Sansa was the highlight of episode two ^__^

 Sansa is another one I like way more in the tv show. Yeah. think I'll stop reading her parts as well.

 Where is the advantage in reading the book besides being ahead? Margaery is the most attractive second to Khalessi . Jofree seems to like her but I think now that is she is told about him she can be careful but I can tell she has something in mind Funny how Jofree was talking about being gay as something to be punished, yet I get a gay vibe from him. No, not from book 3. I spoiled myself a bit about the existence of a future character, or rather, his continued existence. Im confused? what is this. I can't think of anyone though. her brother? 
 Smart money would be on a so far unheard of Targaryen bastard sired by either the Mad King or his son. Where is the advantage in reading the book besides being ahead? You get to troll/blackmail people who are behind. Which is probably what Struggler is doing here.... Oh and... Not even a competition.

 Not bad oh snap not bad. http://www.buzzfeed.com/lyapalater/g...ff-is-so-weird haha pretty cool to see everyone outside of their roles and kind of weird too since they are mostly new. Favorite one Â Spoiler Woo!! Sam getting the ladies. Hilarious face though. 
 Hahaha, +1 to Sam for no 'hover hands' lol. And is it wrong that I couldn't help but notice there was no Prince Joffrey? Don't think I've wanted to slap anyone harder, both in reality and fiction. But hey, without him, things wouldn't even have gotten interesting, lol.

I think it would of been a lot better with Jofrrey too. I heard he gets a lot of **** for his role though. If anything I think it shows his ability to act as so good that people hate him this much. The threats in real life are just beyond silly though. Nice guy in real life, which means good acting. lol that slap. 
 That kid could give even Daniel Day Lewis lessons in acting like a sneering, self entitled douche. Sad to hear he's getting abuse if its true.

QFT Im confused? what is this. I can't think of anyone though. her brother? Her brothers are dead, silly. Rhaegar is one of my favorite characters, though, despite being dead for the entirety of the series. Originally Posted by Oh Snap.

Possibly the most legitimate Targaryen atm, actually, as far as heirs go.

 Ok my monies are on Bronn or Jon Snow. No, I don't want you to tell me if I'm right or wrong. Enough about the books, moar watching, less reading!

Rhaegar is one of my favorite characters, though, despite being dead for the entirety of the series. lmfao and how does that happen? man I still don't know everyones name in this series and its huge freaking cast. Rose looks like Jessica Chastain... sort of. leslie looks better outside of her role imo. Half man taking the throne would be the best thing 
 Originally Posted by Oh Snap. Ok my monies are on Bronn or Jon Snow. No, I don't want you to tell me if I'm right or wrong. Enough about the books, moar watching, less reading! More Rose Leslie pictures, then? Fine with me! Very fine... Originally Posted by Zer0 lmfao and how does that happen? Because he's pretty much the most universally respected character in the entire series so far that I'm aware of, and I like how...well, perfect he is. Things like Cersei saying that the smallfolk cheered for Tywin Lannister twice as much as they ever did King Aerys, but only half as much as they did Rhaegar. Or how most compliments Daenerys receive have to do with her being compared to him. Or how even Jaime believed he'd have made a good king, and that he still remembers the "iron tones" of Rhaegar's voice. Or how Barristan Selmy, who had served three kings, thought Rhaegar would have been better than all three combined. Or how he used to be such a bookish introvert, and the interesting way in which he started his training to become a knight--only to become one of the greatest to live. It really seems like he's made out to be the perfect Targaryen, making the turmoil now all the more unfortunate, considering what could have been with him as king. A real pity he fell to an oafish Baratheon with a hammer. Plus, the way his armor is described is just pure badass. All black, with the Targaryen dragon on his breastplate, encrusted with rubies; his tall helmet with red, orange, and gold silk streamers flowing off of it, looking like flames...dude's a baws.

 Love the show thus far. I don't think Tyrion is interested in becoming king, but I am positive he will pull something to get rid of his father and sister, and it'll be fun to watch. As for the house I would choose, I say the hell with the humans, I'm with the white walkers. 
As I am, so shall ye be. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/GCIACST/ www.gciacst.com
 
 lol I guess some people really wanted her crooked teeth to be in the show as well.
