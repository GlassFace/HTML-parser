 I joined a gym
 Yep just did it today. Its a regional chain. I should be seeing a trainer tomorrow if one is available. I'm excited. I think should push me to that next level. I feel good about my decision. They have the usual equipment. I plan on going at least two or three times a week and once on the weekends. Its only a couple miles away so travel isn't a problem. I'm hoping this will keep motivated long term. I tend to do these workout sessions in spurts. A few weeks here and there and then long stretches of no activity. I'll be sure to report back after my session.

 Good for you man! Don't wear yourself out, I think (as you said) three or four times a week is sufficient. Anymore and you won't give your muscles any time to build up. Anyway good luck!

 Hey, congratulations on taking a good first step! I hate to come here with advice, but if you want to make the most out of your experience, it's necessary to follow a good lifting program. Being one of those guys wandering around wondering what to do next is nice and all, but it's actually really not a productive way to have a workout. There are a lot of them around, but a 3x/week lifting program would probably be the best for a novice. I usually recommend Starting Strength, as it's a very simple routine that can you can use to learn the core lifts and make great strength/aesthetic progress in the meantime. If you're trying to lose weight, just follow the lifting routine and eat at a caloric deficit. I recommend learning all of the core lifts by starting out light (as the program recommends) and studying the motions on Youtube. Properly done weight lifting is extremely safe, but you can get injured if your form is too bad.

 Thanks everybody. I haven't had my first session yet. @buddy Lee - actually I think I want to focus on my abs. Or rather I want to get down to my abs first . Oh I'm not that far away now but its not a six pack that's for sure. I'm sure the intro session will cover a recommended lifting regimen. I just don't want to be a muscle guy. I'm looking for tone not bulk. I'll keep you updated.

You can do ab exercises all day, but unless you have low bodyfat, there's no way to have a six pack. It's also worth mentioning that properly done squats, deadlifts, power cleans, and even overhead presses work your abs quite heavily as well.

I might not be there 100% yet but I've really cut back on junk on and have been eating healthier. I appreciate your insights.

 I think the plank is an awesome exercise for core. Just don't forget leg days!

It's not weird to feel insecure about going the first time. But once you get used to it, you'll notice that none cares about what you do or how you look in the gym because they are busy with their own training. :P

Thanks for the words of encouragement. I will not be wasting the money I spent on gym clothes. They shall be worn and often!!

Don't know where to go or where to start and all eyes staring me down like im an animal at the zoo.....funny though, my gym tights are striped.... I understand that feeling. I was sort of feeling that way earlier. I just had my first training session. I get two sessions with my membership than its a separate fee if I keep going with a trainer. I'm not sure right now. I wasn't nervous after getting settled in. My instructor was pretty down to earth. He wasn't a super motivational ra-ra type guy nor was he a drill sergeant either. At least not on the first session. I'm happy to report that my BMi is in the healthy range for my age group. I'm not in the in shape range yet. I have to knock several points off it in order to get there. But at least they weren't calling an ambulance and yelling code blue stat! So for the first go round we did a stint on the treadmill. I used to have a manual treadmill but never used it and got rid of it years ago. This was my first time on a powered one. It had an incline too. It was a moderate walking pace at first and then over ten minutes he increased the incline half a point up to 3.5 degrees I think, 3.5 something any I think. I didn't notice it at first until the last increase. Then I really felt it in my lower legs and more importantly the back of the legs. We also did lots of squats and lunges. The one that was the hardest was against the wall. The second set he had me do was killer! But I did it the whole time. I thought I'd collapse but I only had 5 seconds left to go and finished it. It was nice to hear him say I have decent stability. So the biking and skiing on the ski machine were doing me more good then just weight loss. I have another session next Tuesday night. That will be focusing on weight training. I don't want to bulk up but I will try to mix it in with cardio. I'm gonna go in on my own for the first time on Saturday. I'll try the elliptical first. Its closest to the ski machine - I think I have the right machine listed here. Anyhow thanks for the support and encouragement. Im looking forward to having a structured program. And the people there seemed normal enough. I didn't feel too intimidated.

 Ok good luck but don"t push yourself too hard. Going more than 3 times a week seems a bit excessive on my point of view. Have a fun and eat heathly

Have a fun and eat heathly 3 or 4 times works perfectly for me at least. I do legs and core on mondays, chest and triceps on tuesdays, biceps and the back on wendesdays and shoulders on thursdays. Leaving me with 3 days to rest or reschedule my gympass by resting a day in between.

 So I had my first cardio session. I did thirty minutes with a 5 Minute cool down on an elliptical. It was the first time I used one. Its stance is wider than the ski machine I use at home. Also the handle bars are set wider apart then I'm used to. But I certainly got a good workout. Though I was pretty beat after words. Not in pain just tired. I averaged about 3.5mph and went 2.1miles in distance. I burned just over 280 calories. I hit the target heart rate the trainer suggested but I was on the high side. I'm gonna need to use breathe right nasal strips. My nose is usually stuffy (sinuses and stuff like that). So hopefully that will bring it down a little with better airflow. I'm also gonna need to get a sweatband. It was a light crowd in the afternoon. But there was an interstate college football (not soccer) rivalry game today. I'm sure a lot of the regulars probably had parties setup for it. Though I think it was fairly busy in the back with the weight section. So I think I will enjoy this. I may decide to not go some days and work out at home instead. Also I'm planning on signing up for the extra training sessions. Im not sure when though.

I have stuck with it. In fact I just went tonight. I did some leg weight lifting this past Sunday. I did arm lifting today. I haven't done free weights on my own yet. But I have stuck to it since my guided training sessions ended. I'm shooting for a Friday session. I've also kept up my junk food restriction.
