 Gotham the TV show - who is interested? - Page 2
 http://www.fox.com/gotham/ Well I've seen the commercials and im moderately interested. I don't think it'll be as rewarding as the Nolan trilogy was. Since its TV they'll have a pretty small budget. I'll give it a chance. I! Really more excited for Marve agents of shield season two.
