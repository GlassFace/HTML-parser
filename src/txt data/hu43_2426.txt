[Mecha] Break Blade (aka Broken Blade)
 People are saying the movies are ultimately more better than the anime, but I feel that this series did a great job at creating a dramatic plot and strong characters in the amount of time it had. Awesome anime, really damn amazing with the action and drama. Although the story may be just a bit generic or cliche, I totally overlooked that insignificant base element and was enthralled in all the unique things it did. I mean, Valvrave was cliche as **** but it was awesome.
