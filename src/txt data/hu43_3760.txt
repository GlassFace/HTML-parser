 Prelude in E Minor (Chopin) - Piano Cover
 Since you're a musician who obviously appreciated Chopin I'd definitely recommend the movie "Secret" by Jay chou if you haven't already seen it. It's a piano movie that contains a lot of scores heavily based around Chopin's work, Jay chou, like myself states that his favourite composer was Chopin so he tried to incorporate his work into the movie almost like a tribute.
