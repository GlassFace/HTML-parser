 Have you ever felt like you got worse at a sport?
 I used to really be into football, I won alot of medals and trophies for it and was picked to play on the school team, but I started loosing interest in football and that resulted in me putting in less and less effort and to the point were I wasn't as good as I could be so I quit. As for your initial problem ill give you a piece of advice, the most important thing about football is not something that you can work on at training or can learn like a new trick, and that is confidence. The more confidence you have in football the better you will play, right now if you doubt your abilities your not going to play so well so focus on what you think your weak spots are and improve on them till your satisfied with that level and one of my favourite quotes I remember from playing football is "Confidence is a trick you play on yourself" good luck!
