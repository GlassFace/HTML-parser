 New Story Idea
 Well...I'm super bored and I came up with a crazy new idea while listening to music again. I'm also typing this up in case I ever forget which I doubt but I can come back here to see what I've said. Would suck to see A4 dead years later...I can't get this stuff back but A4 seems to be sticking around all these years later. So, as of now there are ten stories in my Bloodline Series and at least one of which is going to be multiple books. Now before I get to the new idea, I'll give a brief description of each in the series. This isn't part of my Parallel Works series which is another four books, all of which I've already told the community about, whether people read it is another thing but again, just writing this so I can look back and remember my ideas if I ever forget. Parallel Works: Book 1; Soul Cry Book 2; Own World Book 3; Encounters Book 4; Without End These stories are leaner and follows the spiritual aspect of the Bloodline Series. While the Bloodline Series is meant to be standalone, they can also be read as a series to get the full picture. Bloodline: Book 1; Celestial Takes place far into the future, hundreds of years after book 2 The main plot being people of Mars can't return to Ocean (Earth's future name) and war breaks out because of this, Ocean has stopped supplying Mars with trade goods. Marie is the main character for this story and she's a time traveler and is involved in most books after this. Book 2; Wrath (Name not Final) Modern Day as in now. This one involves Norna a person with the ability to control blood. She meets the second main character thought the series which is the Egyptian man known as Zed'Cal, the original welder of the Hell-Forged Sword. The main plot is saving Zed'Cal from Saul, a demon who they end up battling in a huge war which is broadcast though the sky. (Like the ending of Gurren Lagann) Book 3; Forest of Guilt (Three Separate Books) Takes place prior to Book 2 the main character being Cory (Marcus after the first book in this mini series) otherwise know in book 2 as Norna's father and he gains the power of the Sun(I'm still debating the exact power, but it may just be radiation). This follows the mystery behind Cory's great grandfathers wealth. This idea took me 3 years to develop. Most of the inspiration came from Higurashi and Umineko. Book 4; Lament (Name not Final) I have to thank a song from Rise Against. Hero of War. This follows Rupert, father to Cory's great grandfather. He unlike the other's in the Bloodline has no power, he refused it. His story takes place during World War 2 where he takes in two kids after killing there mother. There is more but this is just a brief summary. Book 5; Crimson Zeppelin This is my crazy idea book. So not much is developed here yet, but I plan to have it be more romance but it still takes place during World War 1. Russell is the main character, he has the ability to control air (not sure yet) still the story is in development. But he is tasked with rescuing a girl named Viola. The idea came to me from this: Book 6; Clocksmith Going back much farther, we meet Jack Elric who still lives in London, this is during the early 1800's. He has the ability to change atoms, and he's called an Alchemist. This is where we diverge and we come to the Parallel Works story's beginning. Zed'Cal who is friends with Jack has a love interest during this time, but because of Zed'Cal's abilities that love grows angry with him. During this time as well, Zed'Cal and Jack need to ask Lily, Zed's love interest to help give birth to Marie who is in labor during this and is consider for a time the main villain of the story before Lily dabs into seance to get revenge on Zed'Cal and in turn in ported across world lines to her current state in the Parallel Works series. Book 7; Author's Court Going back even farther this takes place during the time of Author who is in the bloodline and has the ability to turn into a Bear. The main character is a young boy who finds himself in love with Marie's daughter. During book 6 Marie is goes to the past against Zed'Cal's instructions, this is her 3rd time going to the past, well farther into the past. she was told during book 1 she should only go so far back, but she ignores this. She raises Page for a few years. This is another story in development, I haven't though much of it yet. But the end events in this story lead into book 4. That or the end events of book 6 lead into book 4. Its been such a long time that I thought this far back into the series that I've forgotten but I'll figure it out when the time comes. Book 8; Revaluations Takes place between book 1 and 2, basically the ends of days which happens on a dimensional plane...this may even tie in with the events between book 3 and 4 of the Parallel Works series. Involves most past and preset characters presented. Book 9; Harbinger Unrelated to the actual events of book 10, those three are but a legend now. During a three hundred years period between Zed'Cal, Erin, and Luna leaving to fight God and the end of the world, inhuman events have been happening, those included the near extinction of the human race which they die off by killing each other and forming small clans with the few humans remaining, one of which has killed off all the female, only one left alive by the name of Opal. This follows her and the end of the humans race. I swapped book 9 and 10 around because this makes more sense. Book 10; God's Game End of the series. But I came up with Kings and that will come after the Bloodline Series. Zed'Cal, Erin, and Luna have a truce, promising not to end the three races that have made it to the end of God's Game which he started all for his amusement. Many races started, only three are left. Each given a Hell-Forged Sword and than having it taken away during the events of this story, they then become mortal again. This takes place years and years after book 1. And Book 1 is three thousand years or so in our future. Book 9 happens during the events in this book. Kings: The Kings series begins after this and follow's Kri, but that's for another time. Well hope you people who read this enjoy my vision for my story and maybe become more interested in reading it. Bad spelling, grammar and all even if they are only first or second drafts.
