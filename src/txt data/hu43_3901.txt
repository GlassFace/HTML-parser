 ABC News does piece on video games, lulz are had
 So, it's kind of funny how things work out sometimes. Stephanie, AKA Sushilulu, the girl in the video who was being sexually harassed by the male gamer in Counter-Strike, had another interview with an independent gaming blogger. In the video she trashes Anita, denies ever getting a single rape or death threat, and sheds light on problems that females face in gaming communities. Her opinion does not reflect the story that Nightline spun. A few days prior, the guy used as an example of "some gamers are fighting back," heavily disagreed with the segment as well. He did a Q&A on le reddit (if you're curious to check it out). So the people they interviewed don't even agree with them? Oh, except Anita, but it was her narrative being pushed in the first place because that's the most dramatic one possible. Oh boy.
