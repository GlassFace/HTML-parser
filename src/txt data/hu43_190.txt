 Linux users...
 Its working out great for me, its fast and customizable, but on the down side it cant run .exe files at ease. Actually, it can run ".exe-files" just fine. It cannot however run windows executables. Filename endings aren't important in linux, you can name all your programs something.exe and they'll be just as runnable as they were earlier. Still, that would be kind of boring, having to type "ls.exe" instead of "ls" all the time in the terminal... Oh, yea, I'm just nitpicking over here. I'm a gentoo'ist myself. Tried a lot of dists (also worked at a place that ran a total solaris environment for a couple of years) but none was quite as good as gentoo. Ubuntu is nice when you're new, and I usually recommend that distribution to people that I want to introduce to linux. But after a couple of years with linux you'll most likely want to switch it up. I haven't had much success with Linux. First, I couldn't get it to play nice with the Windows 7 RC at all, so I gave up for awhile. I tried to use it on a laptop about a month ago, but it was one problem after another. I finally gave up on that when I couldn't get my wireless card to work, especially after installing the recommended drivers made things more complicated. Yea, laptops are a *****. They usually put silly hardware in those and don't tell you the information you need to get it up and running. I blame the hardware manufacturers. It's a shame that you couldn't find any help online to your problem. Usually it's possible to find great help if you ask in the right way, but I agree that this is a thing that is keeping linux from widespread acceptance. It's really a shame.
