 1st Playthrough + No Walkthrough Do other players do this often?
 I just want to enjoy the game before I get into the technical stuff. Crisis Core was ruined for me (mostly) the instant I looked at a walkthrough. 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
