 Forum Housekeeping - What do we change, add, and/or remove?
 It's that time again! A4 is looking to update its musty old image to get in line with all the hip young kids and their strange-looking new Pokemons. Much of the current layout has been in place for years and is in need of review. With renewed access to an active administrator and a re-energized staff we want to enact a little bit of change to make the place look nice while keeping it familiar. So we ask you: what do you want on your A4? Take a quick peek at the forum index and it's many sub-forums and tell us what you use, what you don't, and what you'd like to see added and why you think it would made a good addition. We'll go over all of the feedback, discuss it internally, and make the changes in the coming weeks. This is your time to have your voice heard as we deliberate what to change and how to change it. Let us know how you feel!
