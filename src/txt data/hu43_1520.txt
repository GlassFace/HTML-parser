[Anime] Strongest Anime Character
 Hey I guys I've been wondering who is the strongest anime character I would have to say Goku from DBZ, but I want to know what you guys think. Cant wait to here what you guys got to say. 
 Kirito from Sword Art Online. He is so overpowered to the point it's irritating. 
 So many books, so little time.
 Haruhi and Nagato. Gilgamesh from Fate (and avenger for those of you who know who that is). Spec3 Nivash from Eureka seveN and SpecV from the movie. Misaka, Accelerator and Touma from To Aru...Index/Railgun. Izanami from DTB (understandably). These are all OP characters, but goku definitely wins!

 goku for sure, the spirit bomb made from everyone in the universe was to OP for anyone to handle 
"I'll say it once more. I am the mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma!"
 It's Madoka Kaname, from Puella Magi Madoka Magica. She becomes a literal god capable of changing causality. 

 Roberta Cisneros, I mean let's face it. She's a boss in the new series of Black Lagoon:Roberta's Blood Trail. 

 I'm going to have to agree with Ian on this and add in Haruhi. Essentially god characters. All powerful beings that can change the universe. Madoka for the better, and Haruhi so she remains content. 
  Spoiler 
 Forgot Madoka, i acknowledged haruhi but goku is definitely awesome enough to be stronger. If it was just a question of effect, of curse a god would lead, but in strength (of any variety), i think otherwise.

 But a god character can have any strength he/she wants. Even to surpass Goku. Or do the reverse and remove all of Goku's power and still be stronger than him that way. 
  Spoiler 
 But that is an assumption. Haruhi would never achieve something so specific, unless say goku were to destroy her, which he would never do. Also given the character representation, i think goku has the most willpower, and his strength will increase for ever, however a god would still imply strength above that. I think it depends on how this topic is defining 'strength'. Hurm, maybe, confusing...

Cant wait to here what you guys got to say. Goku does not make the cut because even in the Dragon Ball universe, there are still several tiers of power above him, as stated by Bills in Battle of Gods, who defeated Goku with just 70% power. That being said, I am sure there are plenty of Gods in anime out there. This topic should be, "Strongest Gods in Anime."

 I am going to go with Sebastian Michaelis from "Black Butler" in his stripper heels demon form. 
 It will either be a 'god' character or a Pokemon. Newer Pokemon have the ability to change reality and shape the dimensions iirc.

 Okay i finally have decided. Botan from clannad is clearly OP.

 Strongest and most powerful are different, no? In regard to my memory of animes I've watched, Strongest(brute strength): Alex Louis Armstrong of FMA. Most Powerful: Haruhi, Death Note's Light, or Alucard.

 Natsu Dragneel! From Fairy Tail and or Rin Okumura From Ao No Exorcist {a.k.a Blue Exorcist} in my opinion. 
 Kirito from SAO. Come on, we all know you can't win EVERY SINGLE battle without losing ONCE in an ENTIRE SEASON.. Like.. even if he was beaten without dying. Note: Finish watching SAO before reading the next part.  Spoiler The only time he DID lose was right at the end where he was stabbed. Even then he came back from the dead and won the battle. I mean.. WHAT?!

 Ippo all the way~ Seriously though, with all the godlike characters out there, the topic is kinda hard to discuss :P Or you can just point out the most OP characters from every shonen series ever. 
 Ichigo in his Getsuga Tenshou Mugetsu form from Bleach. I'm not really a fan of this anime (the shinigamis don't look like shinigamis!) but I can see that he's basically invincible. It's like if you gave Kirito from SAO the powers of a Soul Reaper and a really awesome sword that releases huge blasts of power.
