[General Discussion] Are you an optimist, pessimist, realist, or other?

And this post perfectly sums up the issue with this question. It's on par with asking someone if they are an open minded individual. Next to no one views themselves as closed minded, and next to no one thinks their views aren't grounded in reality. When you're arguing with someone, you think your points are in the right, but the exact same thing can be said for the person you are arguing with. So the Realist and Open Minded titles are worthless when they come from a first party. In my personal opinion, proclaiming that you are a realist illustrates a huge lack of self awareness. But as for me, I'm a pessimistic twat.
