[General Discussion] Best & Worst Christmas Present You Received
 The worst gift I ever got was a candy bar. The best? Any gaming system I have received as most of them were Christmas gifts. 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
