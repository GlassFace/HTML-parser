 Dressrosa Arc
 --Please note, this thread is about the latest Arc. Don't read unless you like spoilers or are completely caught up-- Â Spoiler Hope this is in the right place. So far, the Dressrosa arc has been the most badass arc since the Marineford arc (though hopefully not as sad). The biggest thing that I've been completely pumped for is the potential new recruits. Luffy has gone a straight 300+ episodes without recruiting someone. That's the longest he's ever gone! Granted he doesn't really need a new member... There are still plenty of people who would make a badass new recruit. 1. Kyros - I mean there's no need for an explanation... The dude is a freaking badass. Now imagine if Franky gave him a mecha leg.. Mecha leg Kyros! How badass would that be!? 2. Violet - Out of all of the devil fruits in the world, Violet's would be the most damn useful one for the Strawhats. After all the crap they got into because Luffy rushed in, or getting split up, or Zoro getting lost, her power would have saved their asses so many times! I can't stress how much they need her. Plus she's a girl... Idk about you guys but I think the Thousand Sunny needs more boobs. Then there's Bartolomeo. The dude is the best fanboy I have ever seen, I love it. I doubt he'd get to join the actual crew, but what about a second division strawhats? Then there's the one question that has yet to be answered... What is going on with Sanji, Nami, Chopper, and Brook on the Thousand Sunny after Big Mam's ship showed up!? I have to say, out of all the Arcs.. this so far has been my favorite and it isn't even over with yet. Anybody else with me?
