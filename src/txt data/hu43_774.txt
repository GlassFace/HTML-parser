 Eren is definitely one of the most badass characters i know. I agree i hate it also how ep 4 ended but finally action is comming in the next episode! And if i counted correct at least 6 from the 10 students doesnt joined the military police , what i peronally think its cool. 
 
 Potato-Chan is 2nd best in show. Honestly. But really, the faces Eren makes and the animation of his glowing eyes are beeeeautiful. I like the direction the show is heading and I'm hoping it continues to be animated so well.

 The last episode ended off on such an awesome cliffhanger, can't wait for next weeks episode . 
 Well f*ck, I can't give this show up now...if it wasn't so over hyped I would enjoy it that much more.

In the end it all comes down to what YOU feel is good or not. But whoever made that comment about Erens' facial expressions, I agree with you 100%. Those moments when it zooms into his face makes the intensity of the show shoots up so much. And the animation is so crazy, it makes you feel like you're in the show. Damn i really can't wait for the next eppi.

 ^^lol Episode 4 was a blast to watch, I hate the fact I have to wait till next week to see whats gonna happen, but it should make for an awesome ep. Nice colourful characters to, hope they don't die on me right of the bat. 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 Ahhh! Episode 4 ended on such a cliff hanger! I was seriously expecting Eren to chicken out, I'm glad he didn't.

 Originally Posted by Zainox Ahhh! Episode 4 ended on such a cliff hanger! I was seriously expecting Eren to chicken out, I'm glad he didn't. No way he's going to chicken out. As Ian said earlier, he's your typical, naive shounen main. That whole "take everything head on" attitude that he has should be a dead giveaway. But, as Ian also pointed out, he inhabits a very seinen world which doesn't take that attitude.

 Ep 4 was pretty great, love that you had the group bonding and this very saccharine scene interrupted by the same giant titan appearing quite literally out of nowhere, threatening their existence yet again.

The only problem I have with that is that  Spoiler it just happened to appear out of nowhere at the exact moment he was there. The chances of that happening have got to be ridiculous.

The chances of that happening have got to be ridiculous. Not ridiculous necessarily, just means that the giant titan is not arriving by foot. Which we already knew, since there was only one footprint visible leading up to the wall in his first appearance. Can only speculate what the source of it is. :3 

 See, now I feel like you know something that I don't because you read the manga. Also, what are the tags for those blacked out spoilers? They look a lot better than the boxes. :x

 That cliffhanger...a good starting point for the next episode though. 

 [.blackout][./blackout] for the black boxes. :3 

 I felt like when the colossal titan teleported with a bolt of lightning right in front of them at the end of Ep. 4 that it was a very comedic moment. It's like something that would see in some cartoon that was on Cartoon Network back in the day.

 Episode 5 was so f*cking epic! The titans came and owned everybody, seeing Eren go and save Armin was crazy because it cost him his arm let alone one of his legs from the other titan. I just know he can't be dead but man did he get the sh*t end of the stick in this episode. Armin pissed me off how he just stood there and watched his bestfriend get eaten, can't wait for next week's episode. When Mikasa finds out what happened to Eren she's gonna go total ape sh*t. This is by far the best anime of 2013, hands down. 
 Well I gave the anime another two episodes and ignoring the hype, the anime forces the feelings of the characters on to you, and like I said with my first comment, it was a bit over dramatic and I still see that. Yes episode 4 was epic, but I was expecting more. Instead we have characters dying off the bat and the other characters experiencing psychological trauma and freezing up. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the show is bad, it's just not for me after this episode. You guy's enjoy it.

 episode 5:  Spoiler ^trollface.jpeg Someone's gonna need an automail mechanic! haha looks like next ep will be a flashback ep on mikasa's past. Just when I was hoping to see some more fighting. This show really knows how to blueball you. Can't wait for it nonetheless!

 I'm thinking about dropping the show for a few weeks, so I can watch the episodes in a Shingeki no Kyojin marathon...who am I kidding, this show is so f-ing epic, that I can't wait for next week, and the week after that and so on. ">I know Eren can't be dead, I just know...that would really bum me out if that is the case. Armin could've been more of help in that situation. And what's up with the characters who I thought would have a future in the anime, dying all over the place

 Episode 5 was so damn good! It keeps ending with me wanting more. I haven't read the manga so I don't know what happens, but I hope he gets all geared up with some kick ass battle automail. x3

 Thomas getting eaten by that titan was definitely a killer lol such an ouch moment for this series.
