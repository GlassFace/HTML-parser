 ABC News does piece on video games, lulz are had
 Yes, Milkchan, saying ridiculous and untrue things online will get you called out. Welcome to the Internet. I see you're trying to backpedal on what you said now, which makes little sense to me because it's clear in writing above. You compared the SVU character Punjabi to Anita and Zoe. I said there's no comparison to be made. For the record, implying I'm responsible for the harassment Zoe and Anita have received is a pretty underhanded tactic and I suggest you avoid it. If you want to call me an ass-hat that's fine, but saying baseless things about people is wrong.
