 #BlackLivesMatter Dartmouth College Course
 It saddens me to see this country become so deeply entangled in racial matters. Getting past racism is vital, but the path that has been shown in the past year or two is one where almost every action or reaction is seen as racist. There is racism, but not to the level that the media and others would have one believe. In fact, many of the things that people who are trying to be "progressive" are doing is very racist, but they feel because their reason is righteous (in their minds), it is not racist. And that attitude is what allows racism to take root and become standard. I heard someone say that hating white people because they are white is NOT racist because whites are the majority and hatred of majorities is not racism. Sorry, but hatred of anyone because of their skin color IS racist. But so many people feel this way that is truly scares me.
