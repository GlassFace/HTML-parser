Answer my call, Dark Spear.
 For me it's between Mei Sunohara, the little demon lol:  Spoiler and Ushio Okazaki </3:  Spoiler both from the anime Clannad. ;[ Btw, its actually definitely Ushioooo <//////3! 
 Going to have to say Illya, from the Prisma Illya series. Her long eyelashes seem to add a lot to her cuteness for some reason.. Her personality is cute too. ^^ I haven't watched past the first episode yet, episode 1 was a free preview on Crunchy Roll. 
 hummm well I think Nai from karnival! He's pretty cute!! 
 
What will it take to enlighten you? I've gone passed the edge and I'm already broken; How do I climb back to the brink and put myself back together again?
 Victorique when she's not acting like a tsundere is soooooo cute 

 Personally I think Azusa from K-ON takes this one. 
 Eru Chitanda from the anime Hyoka, for the time being. 
 Whoever you think is 'kawaii' is cute. But really, for me, I'm too lazy to scroll through and list every character that I think is cute. I just have too many characters that I think are cute. Ranging from Hyouka, Nagi no Asukara to a lot of 'gentle, cute and innocent' characters from otome games/visual novels and fangirl-material. 
 
 Rika from Higurashi (I know right higurashi character) 
 So many books, so little time.
 Hmmm... i saw many anime girls and i think most of them are cute.XD The one i think who is cute is.... Furude Rika from Higurashi Satoko Houjo from Higurashi Aisaka Taiga from Toradora Asuza from k-on! Nagato Yuki from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya And The cute side of Ekaterina Katja Kurae. >_<
