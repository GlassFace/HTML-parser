[General Discussion] Body Modification
 I'd like to discuss this, but at the same time have everyone be civil about the discussion. Mission Impossible - I know. But try. I think many people have an opinion on body modifications. Whether it is plastic surgery, tattoos, piercings, or the down right bizarre mods, most of us have some ourselves, know someone who does, or has a personal opinion on it. I'd like to know if you have any or what you think of them. Also, keep in mind I am referring to body modification in the sense that it does not necessarily improve/restore ones appearance or health (i.e. reconstructive plastic surgery). Go ahead now.

 Beautifying yourself through artificial means may be saying something about your image and self-confidence in your body but it's still something that ultimately makes you feel better and more good about yourself. I'm totally for it, even though I don't always agree with the most bizarre forms of body modification. 
 Unless you're mounting an arm-cannon, or spring-loaded legs you're doing it wrong. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 Tattoos and piercings I can see, but I don't really get anything else. Unless it's reconstructive, Any girl who gets plastic surgery is ugly by default to me, no matter how they actually look. To me, outside fakeness translates to inside fakeness. As for Transgender surgery, I don't really get it. Why would you ever want to change genders? I'm not gonna judge since some people feel that they're trapped in the body of a boy/girl, and want to get right. I'm not one of those people so I wouldn't know how it felt, nor would I want to know It's not on me to judge you Would I ever get with a girl who has had trans-surgery? I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. With the bizarre mods, I just say no. Just no. I try not to judge, but these are cases where it's really hard not to. You've crossed the line of weirdness in my mind if you start tattooing the eyes or the whole body, or start getting your tongue forked, or your whole body changed to a different color. When you hit the point of trying to emulate an animal or become a vampire or weird-ass stuff like that, I just..... just stay away from me please. Do as you please, but if I can't look at you like I would any other person, do as you please away from me...........or I'll most likely stay away from you 
 I've always thought about body modifications, but on a more sci-fi level. Something like altering one's cells and DNA to obtain a new step in human evolution. Unlocking the full potential of one's body and mind is something I would love to witness or experience. Maybe it'll become a reality in the future. A man can dream....

 @kylesar1 gender reassignment surgery is not considered body modification. Body modification refers to aesthetics/cultural/self expression purposes. I don't feel like there's all that much to discuss. Some individuals may or may not approve of *insert type of body modification* but thats really a moot point. It doesn't affect them and its ultimately the persons decision that is having the modification done. Their reasoning is their own. Its just something people feel entitled to judge about when in fact their opinion is insignificant in the scheme of things.

 Body mods are okay as long as the decision was made sober and with an eye to the far distant future (Why grandma, what big _____ you have). 

 I feel same way with Griffmeister. Although I won't like how some piercings, tattoos or whatever look, but I don't really see how that would bother me.

I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. You're confusing sex for gender. Its the same difference as man/woman and male/female. Its understandable that a male who identified as a woman would want a female body. Its unfortunate that no matter how many surgeries or how much you mutilate your body you can't change your chromosomes. Even after transgender surgery you are still genetically the same sex you were born with. I hope that in the future we find a way to allow people to genetically alter their sex that way someone who feels like they can't be themselves or be happy without becoming the opposite sex will be truly be able to.

 I'm losing weight naturally. That's the only modification I need. I still need to work on eating better though. But I'm back at the gym at least.

 What other people do with their bodies is up to them, but I do sometimes see something that makes me wonder if they'll still like that when they're in their 60s or something. I wonder how I'd feel if I had a child that wanted to completely change their appearance? That would be strange. Also, some kinds of plastic surgery don't really fix the deeper issues. And never tattoo your face

Just for the interest, what is your goal like going to gym and so on? Like do you do it for more fit appearance or health reasons or some other, what would that be then? Also I wonder do you have like a plan that you are following or simply go when you feel like it etc. Disclaimer, I'm starting studies for sport and exercise science(bachleor degree) in two months so I'm just curious about stuff like that for example motivations people have for going to gym. So if you won't mind sharing would like to know ^^ 
 Id never get a piercing, and maybe one day if the situation called for it I'd get 1 tattoo 

 Interesting answers so far. Originally Posted by kylesar1 Tattoos and piercings I can see, but I don't really get anything else.

You make this disclaimer that you aren't here to judge but...everything you say sounds like you're judging. BUT, judging is what people do. Everyone does it to someone or something we don't understand. And if we don't understand and we don't ask, we come up with our own conclusions.

Can you or someone else explain to me why gender reassignment surgery wouldn't be considered body modification? I really don't know anything about gender reassignment/gender identity apart from their very basic definitions. If body modification at its core is the deliberate altering of the human anatomy for (but not limited to) the reasons of It is often done for aesthetics, sexual enhancement, rites of passage, religious beliefs, to display group membership or affiliation, body art, shock-value and as self-expression, among other reasons....how is gender reassignment not considered an extreme form of body modification? A part of body modification is (in very simple language) feeling a certain way and wanting the body to reflect that. What is the difference? Originally Posted by Grey You're confusing sex for gender.

I do not have a problem with transgenders. And I won't pretend like I know anything about it/them. But the ability to change a persons chromosomes could pose as a serious problem. If a person could alter their DNA, I think it would cause chaos. It would change the meaning of the very words “identity” or “individual.” It's a difficult subject to dive into. Anyway...enough about you guys. I don't have anything extreme. I do like the idea of being able to change my appearance, but growing up, I knew I would want a professional job where modifications would not be accepted. I kept this in mind when I got the following things - I have 3 ear piercings (1 in 1 ear, 2 in the other) and my tongue pierced. Some people think my tongue may pose as a problem for me but I got lucky. For some reason, I have been able to talk without showing it so people are surprised when I tell them (or when they find out). I also use to have my hand pierced. I removed it after a year.I have a tattoo on my shoulder that is very important to me and my life’s story. It's exactly what I wanted and I cover it simply by wearing a shirt. Simple. And I have thought about what I would think when I'm old and gray. I guess we'll see when I get there but my love for this marking seems to grow as I get older. Not diminish.

 I like tattoos and piercings on others, as well as myself. They're nifty. Beyond that, meh. I'm all for transhumanism, though. That ****'s the tits.

 If it makes the person happy why does it matter? Plastic surgery can do wonders for ugly people and can improve their confidence, and that's good enough reason. also korea. And for anything extreme, people do what they want with their body but I don't care as its not really my thing. With that said I do like piercings and tattoos, albeit lots of people get retarded tattoos. I see piercings as half stress relievers and half aesthetics. Same thing with tattoos, but I don't know what I would get as I can't think of anything important enough to put permanently on my body, and I'm already picky as it is with everything.

So if you won't mind sharing would like to know ^^ I've really met my goal. I'm not on a maintenance plan yet. I could lose five or ten more pounds but if I don't I'm not gonna fret over it. Its mostly for feeling better about myself. I still have to work on eating better though. I'm looking to do three days a week. Mixing biking/stair master stuff and weight lifting (probably some free weights but lots of machine). Mind you I'm not a health nut by any means. I'm just as comfortable playing a video game for two hours as I am working out for forty minutes. I'm just trying to get some balance in my life.

 Thanks for answer. That sound good attitude you got there. Have fun time working out and eating better! Also don't get me wrong here, I'm not actually too much of a health nut or anything myself, even though I will probably work as personal trainer or something similar in future. I still enjoy playing video games several hours a day or watching anime as much as I also enjoy playing sports that time or going for a run. Was just curious since I will work on that field.

 I thought by body modifications you meant like planting pistols in your arm so when it gets chopped off you can still kill the enemy. I need to get a life.

Perhaps any real discussion could be had were it presented more in the form of would you personally get/want/have body modification versus trying to insert your opinion on what other people do to their bodies. Body modification is fairly specific in definition of its purposes, and not so broad as to include any alteration of the body. Body modification is the "intentional alteration of the human body for religious, aesthetic, or social reasons." Gender reassignment surgery does not fall within any of those, as well as trying to fit it into the definition of body modification fails to recognize the complexities of it. Gender reassignment surgery can be seen more as reconstructive surgery necessary for the psychological health of the individual.

Would you ****ing stop with that already? ****'s annoying. Obviously there is a discussion here. Or else this issue would be squashed by now. And it's not. And I'll tell you why. However, note that this thread was designed to be very broad. People can comment on all aspects of body modification. And they have commented on what they think of it in general, what they have, what they want, etc. Even if I did post a specific question..."What tattoo do you want to get??" ....people are still going to insert their opinion of the topic in general. Get off your high horse already. Originally Posted by cberg Body modification is fairly specific in definition of its purposes, and not so broad as to include any alteration of the body.

Gender reassignment surgery can be seen more as reconstructive surgery necessary for the psychological health of the individual. Body modification actually includes most alterations of the body. You are missing a lot of reasons people undergo any type of mods. It's "aesthetics, sexual enhancement, rites of passage, religious beliefs, to display group membership or affiliation, body art, shock-value and as self-expression, among other reasons..." Gender reassignment ties in with self-expression well. Just because it ties in with psychological behavior doesn't make gender reassignment a social/cosmetic operation. If it were purely a psychological problem, it would be corrected with a psychological solution - meds, therapy, electro shock therapy, etc. Gender reassignment surgery is, in simple terms, a big thing. But just because it is extreme and serious doesn't exclude it. That person is changing their appearance for many reasons, social reasons included. If someone received plastic surgery....body mod, right? If that person did it because they said they had body dimorphic disorder, does that change anything? Not really.

The fact that you had to put a "be civil" disclaimer in the OP means you already knew it was failed from the start, especially when there is no reason the topic should even be controversial. So don't get all butt hurt when someone calls it out. And you're seriously stretching with how you define body modification. I emphasize you, because according to your definition having an appendix out is body mod. The term body modification is not that general as you want it to be. And do I need to remind you that you yourself said you "don't know anything" about gender reassignment surgery. So why all of a sudden claim you understand it? Self expression is a conscious choice in how you want to represent yourself. Someone with gender dysphoria does not choose what gender they are.

 I have considered getting modifications. But I wouldn't get tattoos. Instead, I would get scarification. That is where they carve a design into your skin with a scalpel or razor blade and when it heals, it leaves a scar in the design you wanted. If I was to get that, I would want my inner forearms to be scarred. On my right arm, it would read ENVY and WRATH on my left arm. Essentially, envy flows in and wrath flows out. This speaks volumes about me. But I have never decided on it 100% so it is still in the air, so to speak.
