 Guys we're talking about the most attractive not who you crush on the hardest... I guess it'd be hard to differentiate the two though. Also, why do I now feel like some peoples' inner most fetishes are gonna come to light in this thread..? >_> 
 Mine was mostly a joke, I couldn't think of any that I remember being memorably attractive 
 Really I can't think of any animes that don't have at least one or two characters I wish were real so I could make a pass at them. Ha. 
 Just about every one is pretty in anime but I meant I couldn't think of one that was a stand out among everybody then. Serious answer now I guess since I looked through my mal list to try and remember, I really liked Haqua from the world god only knows, so that's probably who I'd go with 
 Ok ok in all seriousness lita 
  Spoiler  Spoiler 
 Mines Roberta all the way, I love the insane murderess side of her. So Yuno is another one, yeah I have a thing for psychos. 

 Yeah in just about every Anime i'd say theres a Hot girl 
 
 Probably Matsu from Sekirei. Smart, attractive, red head, and megane. That pushes all my buttons at once.  Spoiler 

  Spoiler What a cutie. (Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is the best anime, yall) 

 Ian your tastes are......unique! 

 It's Aisaka Taiga For sure :P 
 I don't know, which one looks more like me? Who I'm I kidding? I got nothing on this handsome mother****er  Spoiler That's how he steals your girl 

 I think I would say Alois Trancy from Black Butler. He's beautiful and feminine in appearance. Blonde hair, blue eyes, and long slender legs. I would say physically, he is one of the most attractive anime characters in my opinion.  Spoiler 
 All the girls from Rozen Maiden! They literally look realistically doll-like. I'd pay for dolls like that. As for boys, everyone in Free, obviously.
