 Forum Housekeeping - What do we change, add, and/or remove?
 Yeah, they do indeed still stand. Some people add very short reviews sometimes to the threads, which are okay. We do go through them from time to time and delete all comments that don't add anything to the threads. People don't like to follow rules. =( If the anime already has a thread, all reviews go in that thread. If it hasn't, just post it in general anime and manga, report it, and it will be moved to reviews. We do this to ensure that there will only ever be one thread per anime. As for the quality of subsequent reviews, meh! The OP doesn't really dictate the thread. If someone comes along and writes a totally contrasting review that has nothing to do with the OP, that's great. That's how it's intended.
