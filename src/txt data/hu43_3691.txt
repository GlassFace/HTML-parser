 Video Game Recommendation(s)
 Played Grandia 2 before 1. Played the PC version, and thought the English dubs were great. One of them was va for Ariel from Disney, I heard. Only game I can think of: Terranigma (published by Enix/Snes) Terrangima is one of those rare gems with deep meaningful story. Released too late when the Snes's popularity was declining, so graphics were much better. You get to visit all kinds of places, and its ending was a tearjerker. It's about a young man named Ark who goes on a journey to revive the world (get to help build cities), but then a plot twist and he realizes what kind of person he was all along, that he was similar to being a faker. Gamefaqs rating for this was 4.41/5, which is rare. Most of the reviews highly rate it. Because the story has all kinds of moral themes to it too. 
 True power is not defined by comparison but by discovery of the unexpected. Just like we all laugh at the unexpected, discovery is also every person's best motivator. That is one angle of being self-accomplished. Basically becoming stronger than yourself. P.S. It took getting banned twice to want something within. And no, I am not holier than thou. I am just as selfish as anybody in the world I'm just selfish in a different way.
