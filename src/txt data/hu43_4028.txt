 RIP Melvin Gordon
 http://finance.yahoo.com/news/melvin...205515695.html Gamers and junk food go hand in hand, thus the reason I post this. Melvin Gordon died on Tuesday at age 95 after a brief illness in Boston. No, I wouldn't expect you know his name, but you do know his candy. He was the CEO of Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. I'll leave the bad puns to someone else on this one.
