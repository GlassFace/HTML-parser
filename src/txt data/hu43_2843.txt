[Event] [FINALS] A4's Greatest Anti-hero: Free for All - Page 2
 I don't think some people realize how close this match is at the moment. 3 of you are nearly deadlocked. You have that wall of text called a second rule to thank for that. If it truly does deadlock, we may be looking at a 'sudden death' round. Let's hope it doesn't go that far.

That is something a hero would do, right?

 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses. Beside you as you like softly down, I will be until I hear the words "Checkmate". ~Sebastian Michaelis ~ Individual 4 ~ A4's Greatest Villain <Right Here Lmao 
 Well, this one looks like its reached a statistical dead heat as well. Damn. On the H.I.S. index, Jellz and Struggler are running the closest.

 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 I'm sure our graphical artist can whip up a little something for KT. Primary awards come first. Gold and Silver. No one cares about a Bronze winner... which is why I might do it just to shame whomever.

 This one's too close for judges to call at the moment. Apparently only two contestants were adept enough to take advantage of the second rule.

 Update: Still waiting on two judges to get back to me. It's a close call.

 Update: Everyone waiting for the final results, one of the judges got back to me and put a judgment in in Struggler's favor. So that leaves Struggler and Jellz in a tie. The last judge is still going over the last 15-30 posts both contenders have made recently. Oh, and thread participation. One will get the gold, and one will get the silver. And I know you're reading/watching this Tony... STOP BEING A NAG ABOUT THE RESULTS.

 All right! My last time bumping this thread with an update. Looks like we have a winner here, people. Thread participation played a big role in this person being named A4's Greatest Anti-hero. And that winner is....  Spoiler Struggler.. and he's asking you to let the sea fill your lungs, apparently; Take a bow, jackass. Actually, I fully anticipate you gloating for as long as this remains relevant and beyond. And a parting gift for those who didn't make it...  Spoiler
