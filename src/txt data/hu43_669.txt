 The Tenchi series... what's the best universe?
 Okay, so what do you think is the best universe in the Tenchi series? Personally I used to love the OVA, but then they left us hanging and finally Tenchi punked out and married everyone. So currently my favorite is the Tenchi Universe series where he picked Ryoko... not just at the end, but in the time-space adventres, and in the movie.
