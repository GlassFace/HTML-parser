 Hello fellow anime/manga fans!
 Hello fellow anime fan. This is my first time on a anime forum and I can´t wait to meet so many people withe the same interest. I really don´t know what to write here, so here is something about me. I have been an anime fan in two years now and have seen apooksory ten anime´s and reed two manga series. My favorite writer is Ken Akamatsu where i love how he can drag out a moment to be exciting over a longer time. I am at the time studying film, but i am also writing screenplay and different small books when I not are producing any films or when I am working with screenplay to other people. I hope one day to create some movies that have features from anime series and manga´s. I want people who says "anime is horrible" to watch the movies and like them for then understand it is based on manga and anime so they understands it is wonderful! I hope i meet several wonderful people here!
