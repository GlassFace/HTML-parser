 Majin Bone
 Holy crap, the action in episode 30 was fantastic. Episode 31:  Spoiler This episode  Spoiler marks the separation of the first part and the beginning of the second part of the plot. Cerberus's experimentation is sinister, and Shougo finally learning about his mother was a really cool plot point! New cocoon looks cool too, I can't wait to see the main cast battle both in and out of it. Great CGI moments with the fight against Dark Hawk. Episode 32:  Spoiler Shougo's mother was a great person, and it was awesome to see her and her son learn more about each other after all these years. Dark Crow and Kraken provided a spectacular action-packed battle segment, the solutions to combating them were comical and genius. Episode 33:  Spoiler T  Spoiler he slips everyone's doing in the beginning, xD it's funny to see the team try and cover them up. Shougo's dad is just getting his house full of women! Ruh roh, Swordfish makes his return with familiar friends. Calm down Saho...damn, Shougo's got a lot of secrets to keep, it must make him pretty irritated. The conversations between Shougo and his family are pretty rich in emotional backstory. Sinbad and Eye-Patch are going to Earth...again?! Nothing really new. GOOD episode, the duel between Swordfish and Dragon was great. Episode 34:  Spoiler That ending was awesome, I can't believe Socius is that strong. Antonio and Gilbert had epic fight scenes. against Sinbad and Eye-Patch. Liebert is a great character, I was so glad that she was safe at the end. Her experience in Japan is entertaining, and I feel that Saho is going to find out about Shougo's secret soon.
