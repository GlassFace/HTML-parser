 The Benefits of Warm Lemon Juice.
 Hell, just phrasing your content in the OP better would probably help. You kind of write from a position of authority or knowledge in the way you've structured the opening post, and established this information you discovered as factual benefits you have personally witnessed or experienced. That immediately opens you to criticism, and the lack of sources that buddylee mentioned hurts your credibility, since you're suggesting legitimate medical benefits from this activity. Phrasing the whole thread more as mentioning you're experiences and then asking for confirmation about the effects or even just asking if anyone else has had similiar experiences, or heard about the topic puts you in less of a position of authority and makes the content of the thread the target instead of you. It doesn't set you up in a position where you should have to feel the need to defend and protect your opinion in the same way, and instead becomes simple debunking by examining the evidence. But yeah in general, just always be skeptical of any sort of health conscious articles espousing some great new way to improve a variety of facets of your life by eating or drinking one specific thing, or the like. It's almost always going to be pseudo-science lacking any sort of critical analysis or thorough study proving the effect and is simply someone in a related industry trying to boost product sales or similiarly motivated, trying to take advantage of the health conscious, or it's health conscious types reblogging/forwarding misinformation themselves. Googling whatever it is and seeing if there's any peer-reviewed material or even university studies on the subject is usually going to be a good sign to whether or not it's got any basis.
