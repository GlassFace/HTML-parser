[Anime] Best Samurai Anime ever...?
 What do you think? I'd say Rurouni Kenshin along side with the OVA is the best one in my opinion, Along side with samurai Champloo which was also very fun fast paceג and interesting. what do you think ? ________________________________________________ for the funniest and most sophisticated posts on facebook go here: https://www.facebook.com/TwitteringStatus

 Hmm... I can't really decide... Rurouni Kenshin's story was superb but, Champloo's fight scenes are better. Peacemaker Kurogane is also awesome. I mean, the Shinsengumi's badass. But for me, the best COMEDY Samurai Anime would always be Gintama.

 Shigurui is a strong contender, due to the realism and brutality.

 Sword of the stranger, no doubt in my mind.

 I'm not sure about the best one, but the ones I really like are Rurouni Kenshin and Tsukikage Ran. Rurouni Kenshin has some great fighting scenes (though extremely exaggerated at times, much like most animes lol) and relatable characters. I like Tsukikage Ran because of the main protagonists~ 

 ya i just watched sword of the stranger the other day and it is worth watching without a question. great sword fights

 The Kenshin Trust and Betrayal OVA is a masterpiece. It's a must watch and really is one of those shows you could use to introduce people to anime. Shigurui: Death Frenzy is probably the best series, just because of how ridiculously brutal and violent it is. It's not a candidate for really introducing people to anime though.

 Would Sengoku Basara fit here? I haven't seen many samurai animes, but that one sticks out to me as pretty awesome. 
 In my mind samurai champloo is the best samurai anime, phenomenal story telling and great characters great animation great everything really!

 The only one I've seen is blade of the immortal and i gave up on it after episode two.

 I loved Kenshin growing up, am gonna have to go back and watch it again. 
 Samurai Champloo was an excellent samurai anime 

 Sword of the Stranger was a great flick for all the traditional Ronin vibes... Even though it was largely comedic I adored Samurai Champloo, something about travelling stories just feels right to me.

OVAs: Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal. Pretty much those. The Samurai genre if you will, tends to be given more quality treatment in the manga and live action movie mediums. Samurai Champloo was only slightly more hit than miss for me. Fantastic first episode, kinda kept momentum for another 5 and then fell off in places.

To topic: There surprisingly aren't many Samurai anime out there, but I would probally go with Ronin Warriors.
