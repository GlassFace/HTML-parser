 How often do you want to comment on closed topics?
 Topics are closed on A4 for many reasons, sometimes because these topics are announcements, sometimes to stop spam before it can even happen, sometimes because users have become malicious and moderators have deemed the topic too damaged to recover. When see a locked forum thread what is your first impulse? Do you want to comment on what happened, do you want to try to save a discussion, do you want to get in a playful jab at everyone in the situation? Also, why are some open stickied topics devoid of any comments at all? There are a few open stickied threads here on A4 that are many months old but have zero replies, even in some cases where the author encourages them. Why would you avoid these topics? Disinterest? Distrust? Lack of motivation?
