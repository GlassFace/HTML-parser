[Extended Discussion] thoughts on atomic bombings?
 I can buy the 'quick end to war' argument but I think using 2 was a bit of an overkill. Maybe give a few more days in between unleashing hell on Earth? Damn Truman. Also, I think had they not been used then they may well have been used in Korea or one of those other 'Wars' that America didn't win. At the very least the world got a new benchmark for killing loads of people really really quickly and why that's a bad idea in the long run. So yeahno for me. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro?
