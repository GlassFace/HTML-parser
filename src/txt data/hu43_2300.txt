 Naruto 667
 This was a pretty good chapter in my opinion. We got a little bit of action and we got to see a lot of characters. Itachi being Itachi, a badass turning kabuto into a sasuke fan, which I should have seen coming. Gai being Gai, thinking he is still young and trying to fight madara one on one. I Can't wait for next chapter when he goes red mist or whatever.
