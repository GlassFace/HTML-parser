[General Discussion] Anyone else notice how messed up people are getting now a days?
 So, I jumped on facebook and bam! boobies.. from a guy stand point dayum went through my mind but at the same time I thought what in the hell are these parents teaching this kid.. I'm sure we all have picked up on it and it's sad really, scrolling through my news feed and i have seen so much crap its not even funny. 10 year olds worrying about love and not about when the new episode of pokemon comes out15 year olds getting pregnantkids are getting bolder (this one kid picked a fight with me and said he would get his 'homie' to beat my ass, took me talking to him on skype to tell him he was pathetic and to fight his own battles, hasnt talked to me since.. 10 days passed...)BOOBIES, now adays facebook has been over-run by girls 'accidentally' showing their chests, once or twice is fine but when your 13 and doing it over every photo captioning it with 'he loves my heart' i cant help but think.. yeah girl he likes your heart alright xDThey bring all their drama online and become keyboarding warriors or make fake accounts cause they are too wussy to use their actual account Theres like 100x more then that and i just don't see why kids act this way, I'm sure that most people reading this can picture that one whiney a*s friend in seconds of reading this i called this the year of the hormones.. i am beginning to think i was right xD
