[Action] Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Bread Remembering Appreciation Station
 Late 19th century. Young, handsome and wealthy English nobleman Jonathan Joestar seems to have everything people crave for. His lowly-born adopted brother Dio Brando, brought into the family by Jonathan's father George, is particularly jealous of Jonathan. When Jonathan found out Dio's horrible secret, he tried to use an stone mask that looks like a torture instrument to kill Jonathan, who's into archaeology and might make the death looks like an accident. However, the stone mask is anything but a simple instrument. -ANN - Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a manga that's been ongoing for 25 years. It covers numerous arcs and characters over a pretty lengthy timeline, starting in the late 19th century up through modern times; although one of the latest Jojo stories takes place back in the wild west. It's a very unique story with an equally unique artstyle, but it's very character driven. While it features what what likely be thought of as super powers in the form of "stands," they're often used in fairly unexpected and unconventional ways. The first episode pretty much covered the entire childhood arc of Jonathan Joestar, and it looks like we'll be up to Battle Tendency by the end of the first cour. I'm impressed with everything about it so far, it has fantastic voice acting, they did a great job animating the sound effects and impacts, and the poses and actions the characters were portrayed in, in the manga, are perfect. But if you aren't sold yet here's some pictures: - Also the ED is Roundabout by Yes. Â Spoiler
