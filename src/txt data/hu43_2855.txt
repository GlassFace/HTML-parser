 Marvel Films You're Waiting For?

Most people in this thread seem to have gone for the former, but you insist of correcting them because your interpretation has to be the right one. Well, the official Marvel website displays a list of their movies here, so I'll go with that. The MCU has it's own subcategory but that doesn't prevent the Spidy and X-men films from being Marvel movies. Now to the freaking topic at hand, I'm looking forward to the next X-men Movie. Not because of Apocalypse, but I'm very fond of Fassbender's portrayal of Magneto and I hope he breaks down again like he did in First Class.
