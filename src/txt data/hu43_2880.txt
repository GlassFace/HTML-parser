 Avatar; The Legend of Korra - Book 4 Final Season
 Sooner than anyone expected, it will be streaming online instead of airing, but the usual times on Fridays in the evenings. Don't quote me but that's what I hear. I'm looking forward to it more than anything right now, who else is? Thoughts?

 I am personally very much looking forward to it! Especially after how it ended in the last season, it was so sad, I can't wait to see what they do next! I know I am surprised it's coming out so soon! I hope it is awesome and not a let down though but I think it will hold up!

 ^ No S*it, unless it's a ghost. Then again a ghost is still Toph. I'm looking forward to seeing what Zhu Li is up to.

 ...Oh my. A lot of things going on in this trailer, and that ending hook was a real big mollywhop. The ascension of the Air Nation, a Punished Korra, Mechs, Earth Nation Helghast armies, that random lady from last season's concluding episodes, and a whole lot more.

 I have watched Avatar since the end of Season 1. I'd seen it in commercials before, but was never home to watch since I worked during the air times. After I finally caught its Season 1 finale on replay one Saturday, I was hooked. I cannot wait for Season 4. Season 1 was good, 2 didn't catch my interest as much, Season 3 was pretty good, and I like how it LEADS into the fourth season.

They specifically reference Toph in the last season saying she is alive. Toph just wanders around like a nomad though. I think it's when they go to metal bending nation or w/e and the sister specifically says that.

 Toph and her reverse harem of mixed-species animals. 
 Can't wait for this, it looks so good :3. Only gotta wait a few more days! The excitement is flowing. 
 I started watching The Legend of Korra about a week ago and to be honest I don't like it near as much as The Last Air Bender, then again that's not saying I dislike it. It's entertaining and I'm looking forward to book 4. Currently I'm just finishing book 2

 Episode two just aired and the show just keeps getting better, it's sad this is the final season but it's high on my list of anime...even if its a western anime. Korra battling her inner self/avatar state was a great sight and even her meeting Toph at the end of this episode...never with any western anime have I been on the verge of tears but god this show is good. Season 1 and 2 where kind of half assed but they definitely are pulling all the stops for this final season. Aang was a good avatar, but Korra is even better.

 Oh boy, the factions are strong and interesting. The cast is also nice and complicated with their personal journeys, especially Korra! Really cool ideas always coming nicely with every season, the creative writers are slick. What a great pilot episode, it sets up a nice bittersweet start to what will be a fulfilling and satisfying season of dramatic action and lessons on morality. Really great, ominous Doppelganger Korra, and nice spirit side cast members to get the journey rolling. It's awesome to see familiar faces return, they're like Prophets...of the past. Korra's gotten to be a really good, human character with complex struggles.

 Aang and Korra, apples and oranges to me Toph at the end made me nostalgic for The Last Airbender. Great first two episodes of Korra though. I am sad this is the final season. 
 I can't take the Airbender Kids seriously when I know they're all just mega white kids. Milo has a love interest now? Well, Avatar can always have youthful romance. The swamp...makes 'cha see things. Haha, she just slipped right out of those ropes! That swamp was like "These *****s are retarded. GET OVER HERE." Lovely reunion, it had feels. What wonderful lighting in that poison-metal bending scene! Katie Mattila, that was some REALLY good ****. 
 I'm super sad that this is the last season. Tenzin and Pema need to put their kids in check. 
 Episode five and six were stellar. Both had good family drama, lovely comedy as always, and really cool Hero's Journey/Struggle stuff that meshes well with the individuality of each major and minor cast member. I hope Asami's relationship with her father grows more. Varric is hilarious, and his relationship with Ju'Lee is as bittersweet as always. Opal and Bolin are drifting so much apart, but I feel that they'll be coming back together soon. Korra! Once again, she just gets nipped at her budding times. The Earth Empire Helghast Army is cray cray, just like their leader. 
 Episode seven: The action was amazing in this episode. Varric and Bolin are awesome partners, and the entire rescue mission for the Prince ended pretty sweetly for everyone. Ruh roh, Toph is going to be hyper upset over Kulvira's bullshit deforestation. Episode Eight: Alright, a break is an okay thing to take every once in a while. The chibi commentary was really well written, it was pretty damn funny. The entire romantic aspect of this second installment of Avatar was really terrible at times, and I think the writers wanted to address their **** ups with humor via this episode. Every antagonist of this series fought for the right things the wrong way. The writers did a brilliant job of balancing the stories to spiral to positive endings and results with things perceived as evil. We can also recycle the enemies into cute jokes. Episode Nine: Fire Lady? Tentacle rape spirit wilds. The spirit cleansing from Book Two returns. Oooh, kill 'em Opal! WOW, did Zaher actually show a bit of repent for the results of his fanatical actions? Raava came back also! Thank you Zaher, for your guidance. That Air Bison looked sick as hell at the end, where Bolin had his sweet moment with Opal. It's rescue time, let's go **** **** UP. 
 Episode 10: Woah! She didn't waste any time making her grand appearance known. Yeah that whole "watching with the vines" things does sound really far-fetched, even if it is someone like Toph. Damn, the PResident really does want to compete in this spirit vine weapon arms race! Wu has a good idea for once...? Good job. It's the Great Uniter herself, ruh roh. Lol they're eating ramen? Too homely. Lin made a hilarious face when Bolin asked his...rather insensitive question. I had a feeling Ju'lee wasn't...all that she was cracked up to be. Kulvira is a ruthless *****, jeez. Bolin is such a good guy, Ju'lee needs to be reunited with Varric pronto. Well, the spirits do a great job at blowing people off. DANGER CLOSE, HOLY ****. YOU TELL 'EM TOPH. Well, relationships are stitched up but the threat of destruction looms closer...Korra, what are you going to do? 
 Just posting in this lifeless thread because the show ended. 10/10 finale 
 Was not expecting that last scene... not sure... 
 Something wrong picard? Hm?

 Spoilers With how the final scene played out, I got a strange vibe between Asami and Korra. Perhaps it was just me? 
 No **** Korras a lesbian, picard. I was mostly being sarcastic, its fairly obvious Asami and Korra is canon.
