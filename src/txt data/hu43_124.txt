 video card error
 It doesn't look like what you usually see when a video card is overheating. Its more likely the drivers or the game itself. Update video card drivers as IanTheAmerican said. Update DirectX Is it the Steam version of the game? If so, right click on the game in the Games menu and choose "Defrag Local files" (or whatever it says). If that doesnt work, give the computer a good dust clean out for good measure.
