 Forum Banner.
 Moderators can do nothing about the banners. A4 has changed hands/ is in the process of changing hands, so until the new admin makes his post on the forum to say hello, I can't give anyone any timeline for that. I have talked to him, so he's human at least. Haha! :P I think, just be patient. We've had no fully active admin for almost a year now. I think we can survive a little longer. 
 Do you RP, or are you interested in learning? Join our Role Player's Society here on A4. Would you like a baseball bat to shove up your ass along with that stick? You're a mod, please act like one A4 is on FACEBOOK
