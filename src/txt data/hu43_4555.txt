 Hello! I just joined and am looking for new anime to watch!My
 Hello there! I literally just joined about 5-10 minutes ago so forgive me if this is a bit informal. My name is Leslie, I am 21 years old & have an 18 month old little boy. A lot of Anime features a main character who has lost a parent and now as a mother, I have a better respect for that. (Such as Full Metal) I have always loved Anime and since getting Hulu Plus have been watching it much more often. While I have watched my fair share of Anime, I am looking for some others. They don't have to be available on Hulu Plus, but I would like links where I could find them. I recently started Noragami & I am really liking it so far! Here is a list of some of the animes that I have enjoyed, just off of the top of my head. Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood ❤❤❤❤ Kimi ni Todoke❤❤❤ Naruto❤❤❤❤❤ My Little Monster ❤❤❤ Code Breakers❤❤❤❤ Darker than Black ❤❤ Wolf Girl & Black Prince ❤❤❤❤ Blue River Ride❤❤❤❤❤ Nabari❤❤❤❤❤ Say I love you ❤❤❤ I really like to get emotionally involved and I love character development throughout a series. I have watched many MANY more animes than these, these are just off of the top of my head. My top 3 favorite anime as of right now are: Naruto❤❤❤❤❤ Nabari❤❤❤❤❤ Blue River Ride❤❤❤❤❤ Full Metal Brotherhood❤❤❤❤ is a really close runner up! Thank you for your time! I am excited to join this community!
