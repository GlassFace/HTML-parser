 Re-watching drama/romance anime
 I always go back and re-watch anime, in general. When it comes to romance...hmm, certain episodes of Gundam SEED to get my AsuCaga fix. Most whole series I go back to watch, however, that ARE romance are shounen-ai/yaoi series; Junjou Romantica or Sekai ichi Hatsukoi. Does that count as romance? Lol.
