 @KT It happens man. I lost 2 of my promotions into Gold. Been on a losing streak since then. The team picks and comps aren't bad, it's just the team work and understanding of the game mechanics aren't there for a lot of people so after the laning phase, everything falls apart. Something to consider as well, maybe your position in the game is Silver. You're 300/302 in Ranked Season 3. Is it possible that you're considered a standard Silver player? Use: http://lolnexus.com/ You can determine your positioning in the queue. When you load into queue, are you in the middle of the road? How many people are above you and how many people are below you? If you're constantly finding yourself on the bottom, you're the wild card. If you're constantly finding yourself on the top, you're the pro. If you're not either, you're a standard player. In order for you to get promoted or to move higher, you may need to look into what you're doing that is causing your MMR to consider you as such a player. Are you lacking in game mechanics? Are you not getting how to play certain champs correctly? Are you carrying hard enough? Are you playing certain champions and not performing as well as you should? For example... if you're playing an assassin, mid or adc, the expectation is that your KDA should be pretty skewed towards a high ratio of kills to deaths. If you're playing support, the expectation is that you should have a lot of assists. If you're not meeting the criteria of your roles, it may be factored into your queue. One other thing to consider... When you're in your promotion matches, it some times queue you against harder opponents to ensure that you deserve that promotion. So if you're not able to bring your team together or carry hard enough to get promoted, your MMR may be placing you exactly where you need to be. I'm in a situation that is very like the above where I'm at the middle to the bottom of the list being queued against much more difficult opponents and can't perform. Once I even out, I may be locked into Silver I until I improve my game in other areas. I'm actually starting to see my opponents difficulty go down. I'm seeing far fewer Golds and a lot more Silver II's and Silver I's.

 I genuinely think that I'm good enough to continue. While I'm working my way up to the promo series I'm consistently at the top or just below it, I rarely find myself in a lane that isn't at least breaking even, and I know my mechanics and matchups pretty well. I noticed that during my actual promo series I was no longer put at top, I was at the bottom or close to it. Dunno what's up with that, but each time I lost a promo I had little difficulty winning my way back up to another. It just feels like bad luck when I finally get there and that's when I get game-breaking trolls or AFK/DCers.

All you good players getting denied entry to your next series due to some random trolls and afks. Good thing I suck and dont have to worry about that stuff right?

A calm . mind is the key to success.

Good thing I suck and dont have to worry about that stuff right? You terribads have no idea what challenger level players like me go through. I'm not saying that I'm exceptional or anything here but I do feel like the system is needlessly frustrating. The system it's modeled after, the ladder system in StarCraft II, does not feel this infuriating when you're moving around within the league you currently populate and are trying to climb out of. Mind you, anyone worth anything in that game is playing 1v1 and isn't worrying about team mates. But I still feel like something could be done to make this whole experience less frustrating and make me feel like I'm losing because I was outplayed, not because of other circumstances I have no control over. 

 Play dota instead!

 I think you meant enlightened enough instead of desperate. I mean how could you not want to play a game with far more depth? 
 
 Because that depth requires an inordinate amount of time spent learning dozens of champions with unique frame animations that are vital to last hitting or denying in that game, relearning the item shop in a new game, all the while putting up with a community with less patience than that of league. Not to mention a number of outdated mechanics that are really unintuitive. If you enjoy DoTA2 that's cool, but it's a pretty different experience from what LoL offers. 

 Originally Posted by DcRising I think you meant enlightened enough instead of desperate. I mean how could you not want to play a game with far more depth? DotA 2 utilizes mechanics that I simply do not agree with as being fun or engaging. It's a strategy game that embraces problematic things like snowballing a little too much for me to invest the time and effort to become proficient at it. Plus I hate the art direction and I can't stand looking at it but that's something different entirely. 

 I was assured long ago that this thread would never again become a DOTA vs LoL thread >.>

 Originally Posted by BlackTemplar I was assured long ago that this thread would never again become a DOTA vs LoL thread >.> It's going to come up here and there, especially since DotA players don't have a megathread like we do and periodically stop in to try to tell us how much better they are than us. Plus, you added to this with that clever 6 second long video about shooting people who disagree with you. You're also to blame! 

 @KT When you mentioned that you're being placed at or near the bottom for your promotionals, it's pretty close to what I had mentioned. Generally speaking, the queue is placing you as a Standard or a Wildcard player. What that means is, it's skill checking you to see if you should get promoted or not. In theory, if you are better than the game suggests, you along with the "Pro" queue, should hold up the game... but unfortunately, that doesn't always hold true, does it? The problem with the "Pro" player and the "Standard" players is that they're not always rated correctly. Some of them could have been boosted or cheesed their way into their position. Some things that could mark a "Pro" player has a "pro" is their high rate of wins to loses with very little games played so the game is trying to put him where they need to be or trying to bring his MMR down so it queues him better. Some other things that could mark a "Standard" player as "standard" is a 50% win rate with a high number of games (identical to your makeup). What could actually be boosting you as well, KT, is that you don't just play ranked, you play a bunch of queues that adds to your MMR values. Like I had mentioned previously, Normal, Dominion and ARAM have their own MMR values that gets factored in (whether they're a lot of points or not). If you're constantly placed at the top of your queue, the expectation is that you should be carrying. The one thing to keep in mind, as long as you're positive in LP gain and don't have a lopsided value like +5 LP / -20 LP, you're head and shoulders above the rest still. Personally, I do agree that the League System that is implemented is still batsh*t crazy and honestly, some of the "hidden MMR" stuff that is in the game is downright retarded. The fact that they have a "hidden MMR" actually broke their League system because once players started figuring out the mechanics and how to boost through it, it caused a lot of misuse and abuse within it. I can certainly tell you that there are numerous Gold players I've encountered that don't belong in that league. Ironically, KT, the worst thing to deal with in the game right now is knowing that getting past Silver is far easier than getting past Gold because the majority of the really bad players aren't actually in Silver, they're in Gold. I've lost more queues with Golds versus Silvers than I have Silvers versus Gold. It's embarrassing watching these higher rated players get demolished by Silver II's and Silver III's. The few rare times I actually got correctly rated Gold players on my team against correctly rated Silvers, it was like Hercules punching a Baby in the face. It was honestly not even fair.

 I'm happy to hear that I'm not just being unreasonable and emotional. I genuinely felt frustrated by this and I really believe it could be better. When I lose in other games I can identify not only what my problem is but also what it might take to proceed. League is also much more punishing than any other game I've played when it comes to ladder placement. Street Fighter's rating system is more forgiving and understandable than this. Street Fighter.

I think you misunderstood me. I wasn't trying to come off insulting or anything. I was simply saying that you, shian, and Bt pretty much said the same thing about the whole stuck in a rut situation. I just thought calling it a conspiracy theory was pretty funny since it seems the most knowledgeable LoL players on A4 are getting dragged down by the most coincidental "random," things (afks, dc's, trolls). Also, I might suck compared to you guys.....but I know I aint terribad. > Wish I could say the same for Pured.....but oh well.

 I just think that the "conspiracy" is just a flawed ladder system that could feel a lot less oppressive and unfair.
