 What are conventions like?
 Imagine a bunch of nerdy dorks running around like children in costumes drooling over everything they see and freaking out when they see female cosplayers. That was my first sight :c Yet I went with friends and had a good time, I dressed up as Full Metal Edward Elric and I regret nothing. I looked badass and so did my friends. They dressed up as officers from FMA as well
