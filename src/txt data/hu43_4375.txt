 Was Miranda from Mass Effect modeled after Yvonne?! She was, she looks stunning IRL but hit in-game IMO. 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils? Join Super-Powered and get in on the action!  Spoiler http://www.anime-forums.com/showthre...-Super-Powered

 Dialing back I think my first celebrity crush was 'Baby Spice'. My Father did his best to influence me towards Ms Anderson during her Baywatch days so the 'blonde chicks' thing stuck with me for some time during my childhood.
