 Which cliches/tropes annoy you the most in action/scifi and fantasy movies?
 So what tried and true cliches irk you the most in action/scifi and fantasy movies? I group these three together because they usually include several related tropes that get way overused. For me: 1 - never stopping to aim when shooting at someone 2 - body armor that is all show and doesn't stop anything 3 - the helpless female who never does anything to help the hero when they are able to For the first one why does it seem like any action movie with guns of any type always shoot endless rounds and never hit anything? I even think they did that in the A-Team tv show. Which was bad since they were supposed to be a crack military team. Though it was the 80s and network tv. So I guess they couldn't have a body count in the dozens back then...... For number two I think of stargate and starwars. Why do the jaffa and stormtroppers wear armor at all? It never does anything. Zat blasts and staff blasts kill and stun every jaffa so why have armor? Hell even the ewoks stone the stormtroopers into submission so why wear armor? And why wear white armor in a forest? Hello??? For number three - I guess that's more of a 1950s movie serial thing. I guess woman really have taken on their own roles in power in movies. Though you'll still see it occasionally. What action movie tropes bug you the most?
