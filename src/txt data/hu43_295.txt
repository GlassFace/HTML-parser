 League of Legends - Page 375
 That shouldn't be a bug. I always wished you could pick the same champions in normal. This is pretty much an average game... Pay attention to the arrow the 2 dots... Â Spoiler It was so sad... At the end, they gave up on trying to fight me because I'd win every time, so they just aced my team and then ignored me and went for turrets/nexus.

 Finally gave ranked a chance, I always thought the atmosphere would be vastly different since it's ranked, hence more douchebaggery. It's the same ****. The only annoying bit is the "pick order" because people constantly ***** when they don't get the role that they want. Hit silver 2 with my placements. Lost a few cuz like in everygame, there are always going to be tin/wood league players. 
 Normal 5's and Ranked 5's are very different. Most of the games have no jungler, and don't have adc/support bot. Also, what's a ward?

I've only played like 20 soloqueue normal 5v5's and most of them were like that, don't think my mmr was low since my 3v3 winr ate was over 50%. Found a good duo partner. Hopefully this will fix the above issue of losing when fed. We've won 2/2 so far.

However, it will be exciting to see a ton of new guys. Also IWillDominate returning for the first time since season 1. Can't wait to see what he will bring. I still feel like Voyboy is weaker than alot of other top laners, but his mechanic feel for the game is still good. Makes sense to keep him as the only returning member. 

 How does Challenger mean nothing in NA?

 Challenger doesn't mean much anywhere for the pro players; soloqueue isn't an effective tool for practicing for the competitive scene. I'm curious to see whether Curse will make it out of the Salt League at all, they're pretty much pulling what CLG did last season with the lineup changes, but with Saint gone as a player it might work. Really going to depend on whether or not they're able to function as a team and adapt quickly enough, they don't have all that much time to practice really. 

 But still... Being able to reach and stay in challenger means that mechanically and skillwise you are in the top .01% or whatever. Putting together a team of 5 challengers who know their **** and just need to practice strategies together would be better than 5 Platinums.

Saint was gone all second split and they got a better support in Edward. I think that with the newest line they are finally trying a massive overhaul of the team.

 Saint laughing it up in that Curse mansion. Paid to be a personality, what a sweet gig this must be.

Yeah like Struggler said, it just doesn't really mean much on the competitive level if you don't work well together. Sure, getting to challenger is a good indication that you are mechanically competent, but it doesn't really say much about what your champion pool is, assuming you aren't one of the numerous people who simply rode a single champion to the top like that dude who made proxy singed popular, it doesn't say anything about your ability to work with four other people given the ridiculously stupid **** people do in soloqueue at all levels, and it doesn't indicate you would be mature enough to move into a gaming house and actually put in the time and effort required to make a team work. Think about the strategy teams put into researching their opponents for picks and bans, lane matchups, and even just communicating more closely with the jungler between lanes to set up ganks. In soloqueue all of that stuff is pretty much non-existent and at best you ward and throw out some pings. I mean yeah, if you're recruiting players for a team you probably want people in D1 or challenger as your minimum requirements, but simply being at that level isn't much of an accomplishment if your goal is playing professionally. NA focuses primarily on soloqueue and isn't able to compete meaningfully on a world level, whereas Asian teams have dedicated backup teams to scrim against. There's tons of problems with the way NA as a region approaches the pro scene and soloqueue is a major part of it.

I dunno if Edward was a better support in that situation. I agree he was mechanically superior to Rhux and certainly more experienced, but given the language barrier and lack of time to practice as a team, it just didn't seem like it worked out. For sure this new lineup might work out better, and with Saint removed as a player there's better potential for success, but I'm not sure I'd expect to see them even qualify since they're all still just soloqueue streaming as opposed to practicing 5s. 

 Really? I thought most of the challenger players got there maining 1-2 roles. o3o

 Saints smites though haven't improved at all... *smh* he needs a little bit more work on timing... -.- 

 Wow... I got **** on harass-wise in lane the first 5 minutes of the game and finished with a 2:1 kdr... with 400-600 ping and from time to time i'd just keep sliding backwards and forwards when I click to run away. How I managed to do well and win, god knows... I missed most of my spells.

And that's just the ones actually streaming, certainly there's plenty of other people who just main one character. I mean for sure it doesn't mean they're incapable of playing other champions or roles, but in a professional setting you run into the problem V8 had with PhantomL0rd, and him being incapable of playing a champion well besides Karthus. 

 Yeah, whether it's challenger or high diamond divisions, there's a reason that players like XJ9, Vman, Best Riven NA, and InvertedComposer aren't seen on any teams that do well competitively. Poor champion pools (BRNA and IC) and not working well with others (in Vman and XJ9's case) won't get you far as part of a team. Never mind all the commitments that need to be made to become a pro player on the level of those belonging to the biggest teams; some people, regardless of how good they are, just can't or don't want to do those things -- they will still sometimes agree to be subs, like Wingsofdeath, for example.

 Hmm, that's pretty interesting. Never would have thought that. @Ian, I thought phantom lord was a lol comedy streamer. Is he that colby cheese guy on youtube or is that a different person? Didn't know he was actually good >.>

 PL has a pretty huge champion pool actually, lol. He plays a pretty good Ziggs, Syndra and Brand along with karthus. Being Challenger means that you can either go equal or outplay pro players without practicing 10 hours a day.

Yeah, there's a common theme among the apcs he prefers to play and is good with: they're almost entirely skillshot-based. Karthus and Syndra seem to be his favorites, and they're pretty much the only ones I ever see him using when he's duoing with someone I'm watching, or I check in on his own stream.

Being Challenger means that you can either go equal or outplay pro players without practicing 10 hours a day. Too bad his entire champion pool other than Karthus consists of kinda weak champions. He's a really good mechanical player and I'm sure that if he were to practice up on Zed he'd be ridiculous at him. I don't understand the logic of people saying you should play one role to climb. How would challenger work if everybody only played one role? Every game would turn into huge cluster****s of people not being able to play anything else but their main role well. If you're a big name professional like Voyboy, Dyrus, Meteos, or some other LCS player, you'll get your main role pretty much every game because of the respect the other players have for you, but in any other case you're likely to get doomed to some role you don't want at some point. If you're a top or mid player this is likely to be a common occurrence. The guy in the video a few pages back just talks about how good you'll be at that role with no acknowledgement for the fact that if everybody adopted the "play one role" principle it would require the community separating into equal groups between the five roles and the queue system to account for that. Players are already far too stubborn with getting what they want so encouraging this attitude is kind of horrible.
