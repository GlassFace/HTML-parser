 Recommend me a Horror anime.
 Now, I know that sounds silly coming from someone like me but, I'm well aware of most horror related anime. I'm just not sure which one I should try next. Perhaps there's a gem out there I haven't heard of as well. Anyway please consider a few things. In my signature there's a link to my MAL which has all the anime I've watched. I've watched just about ever popular horror anime. Such as, Higurashi, Hell Girl, Shiki, Boogiepop Phantom, GYO, etc. so please look at my list before you rec something. I have an objective view on what some people call horror. I don't think Tokyo Ghoul, or Elfen Lied for example are really horror. Thriller maybe but, gore doesn't equal horror in my eyes. I like really atmosphere driver stories. I have a long list of dropped series as well. Such as Tokyo Ghoul, and Mushishi which is dark but, a little slow in my opinion. I'll also accept thriller or dark anime such examples would be Serial Experiments Lain. Anyway thanks in advance!

 Hmm, it looks like you've already covered most of what I would have suggested. I can think of a few things that might float your boat, but how essential they might be is another matter. Judge was kind of an interesting one-shot oav about a (demonic?) man who judges the souls of criminals who have escaped the law and a priest/advocate who opposes him. Not a lot to it, but it stuck in my mind. Kind of a nice idea behind it. Devilman is usually one of the more highly regarded entries from the 'blood and thunder' days, but I've barely seen any of it myself, so I couldn't comment on its quality. It seemed atmospheric, if nothing else. It's really a spoof rather than anything serious, but if you've seen Urotsukidoji, you might get a laugh out of Call Me Tonight, which sends up the whole Japanese obsession with tentacle monsters rather neatly.

 Roots Search and Lily Cat, might be two older titles that have a foreboding atmosphere. Mind you, they are older and not full series. In the strictest sense of the term, I have a hard time considering anything true horror in anime. There are a few, but you have already seen them. I also find the gore does not always equal horror. In fact one of the most unsettling anime in the form of psychological for me personally would be Shadow Star Narutaru (pokemon on acid), but once again, not really horror. I'd second the Judge mention from Gaff. 
 
 Oh almost forgot elfin lied and another

I second Mouryou no Hako and add to that Mononoke (the tv-show not the movie which has nothing to do with it) Mononoke should have been on my to watch list but, for some reason wasn't. Was it good? I really was interested in this one. Hmm, it looks like you've already covered most of what I would have suggested.

I can't find Judge I swear I've at least watched some of Devilman. I'll add it to be safe. I've actually watched the first two installments of Urotsukidoji lol ...oh god that anime. It's something else for sure and the dub is even more hilarious. I will be watching Call Me Tonight when I get the chance lol. A friend of mine has a kid and is staying with us so uh, yeah haha.

One of those VHS tapes I would have never remembered the name of haha. Good to know there's others out there that agree a true horror anime doesn't really exist. And that gore doesn't =/= anime. As for Narutaru I've actually read the manga it was fantastic. The anime was a little lacking in being as dark. Does Judge have another name? A Japanese one maybe? On a side note, I am not shy of watching older anime like some people might be. In fact I prefer it. Thank you all so much I can't wait to get started. Also if any of you haven't watched this little gem. Denpa Teki na Kanojo, give it a shot. Oh almost forgot elfin lied and another You didn't read my opening post did you? I've watched or tried everything you've mentioned.

 How was Hellsing not mention here? Best horror anime EVER, period. The OVA series was kinda blah, but the TV series was awesome. 
 It was only a matter of time... Now I am one with the night and stars again... Thank you, Rhyme's Law, for your signature art work.
 He's already seen hellsing. Though i noticed he hasn't seen hellsing ultimate yet

[quote] He's already seen hellsing. Though i noticed he hasn't seen hellsing ultimate yet Hellsing was an anime I really liked so I have not watched Ultimate because, I'm such a fan of the original. Don't want it to be ruined basically.

 ANN has a name of Yami no Shihosha for Judge, http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=686 Denpa Teki na Kanojo is now on my list, thanks. I never read the Narutaru manga, I can only imagine it was better.

Mononoke should have been on my to watch list but, for some reason wasn't. Was it good? I really was interested in this one. Shigurui is VERY historical with no supernatural or any fantasy element whatsoever. It's very matter of factly and artistic without much dressing up of anything. I love it but if you're not a fan of historical anime than I actually disrecommend it altogether. Mononoke imo is really good but perhaps not to everyone's taste. The show consists of five vignettes spread out over the course of twelve episodes. Each vignette tells a different tale of a group of strangers who have to deal with a mononoke (evil spirit). The only link between all five is the presence of a mysterious individual who refers to himself as The Medicine Seller and fights these beings. However The Medicine Seller is only a supporting character in all of these with the principal cast of that particular story taking up the main roles. Each story takes place in a single location where the main protagonists of that story are introduced. Shortly afterwords mysterious events take place and the tension rachets up. Than about halfway thorugh usually the Medicine Seller comes in and explains which Mononoke isn causing everything. That there's the usual plot twist which explains exactly why the Mononoke chose this particular location and these people to haunt. Followed by a climactic showdown between the Medicine Seller and the Mononoke. What makes each of these individual stories so tense and scary is the very surreal and unsettling tone the series has making you jump at even something as seemingly tame as a vase that mysteriously moves from one end to the room to the other. Mononoke is a horror series in the classic sense of the word. It's not particularly gory even though there are some violent images in it but it's more the unrelenting suspense and the mysterious and disturbing nature of the stories that make it well...rather horrifying at times. What also helps tremendously and what is the reason I mentioned it's an acquired taste is the show very peculiar artstyle. It blends traditional Japanese art with a more modern anime style which makes for very strange visuals that only help with the already unsetttling nature of the series. If you want a really good horror show than this should be the second thing on your list. The first one of course being the utterly terrifying Mouryou no Hako. (for more info on that look up the "scare the **** out of me" thread in the main section. I gave a fairly accurate description fo the show and why it's scary there) Here's a trailer for monoke to give you some idea of the show and it's artstyle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OJW9gZL33Q

Wouldn't say it ruins it, but for all the praise heaped upon it, I still prefer the tv version. Ultimate was fun for the first while, but after a bit I thought it just became an excrement-hitting-the-fan montage. However filler-y the tv series was, it at least tried to tell a story alongside the gore.
