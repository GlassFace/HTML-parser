 Originally Posted by Harlequinn It's worked before on other sites... Sorry, didn't see your post. That sounds like a Mafia game. Those are really fun and very much possible to run online, with organization. I'd love to join one, just not sure if my schedule would allow me to participate at specific times, if need be. I was also thinking of starting a supernatural/horror RP, if no starts a new RP within the next week or so. Would just need to get the plot and setting together when I get the time. 

 I've never experienced a "Mafia" type of game, although I believe I did see a review about it on Sit Down & Shut Up. My bias allowed me to rudely say, "I don't think it'd work out." If you go through with this Harlequinn, I'll totally give it a try as it would be my first. Reminds me a bit of Evolve. My requests: How about we have a monster, however it only follows the whims of its master. The master being an unknown among the players. This brings in possibilities for a sci-fi murder mystery. Also, the special "abilities" that the characters possess in these types of boardgames or Roleplays could also be included.

I'm gonna try to figure this all out over the course of the next week.

 We should create the best role play story ever… 

 I'm currently working on a RP. Been years since I made a RP on here. I'd like to revive the RP section and bring more RPers to the Realm. I'm an old-school RPer, so I hope everyone can handle some reading and a possible point system. If not, I may summarize things a bit for those who are afraid of reading page long posts. Don't want to scare away potential/new RPers!

Don't want to scare away potential/new RPers! I like that kind of stuff, so I'm probably game.

Don't want to scare away potential/new RPers! Holy sh!t. Not sure if you remember me (my old user name was AnimeFreak1993) but seeing your username is unbelievably nostalgic. I used to be a ridiculously active RPer on this site a few years ago. Glad to see it's still got a decent community. Anyway, I don't go on deployment for another few months and depending on how things work when I arrive at my next station, I may be able to put up an RP on this site. I've had an inkling for a while now. Not sure really if any of your remember me. 
 A lesson without pain is meaningless. Thats because you can not gain something without sacrificing something else in return. But, once youve over come the pain you will gain a heart that is stronger than anything else." Edward ElricFullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood
 Oh, sup Harlee. I was just lurking here.

If you make an rp, hell yeah I'm jumping in like a wild monster feeding on chil... I mean a monster feeding people food. 
A calm . mind is the key to success.

 Hey Neji! It has been awhile lol. Sorry for the delay, holidays called and stole me away for a bit. PSN being down for me contributes to me being here also. XD I'd do some rping myself but I've yet to cook up anything or see anything interesting yet.
