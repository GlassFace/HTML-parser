[General Discussion] The difference between a good thread and a bad thread
 Recently there has been an influx of new members on A4. This is great, as it makes the board a lot fresher, but unfortunately some of our new friends seem to be a bit unaware of thread making etiquette. While I wholeheartedly believe that some of you are really just too stupid to be capable of understanding or caring, some of you are but just don't know how yet. And that's no big deal! Let's go over a few of the big no-nos in thread creation. (1) Don't make unspecific or uninformative titles *Easy question... *What do you think about... *Does anyone else... As you can see, people who see this thread on the front page are going to be completely in the dark as to what it's about, and either not click it or just guess and enter the thread. A thread title called "Does anyone else..." may very well be a thread asking if you synchronize your orgasms to the drops in dubstep songs. We want to know what we're getting into before jumping into a thread. (2) Don't ask leading or loaded questions *Why is Obama such a bad president? *Do you think Microsoft is just a greedy corporation? *The Boston Marathon bomber: misunderstood freedom fighter? Leading and loaded questions forcefully insert your own opinion into the title and attempt to lead others to agree with you. This is a very easy way to destroy any chance of a decent discussion occurring because people are going to come into the thread with guns blazing. Try to ask non leading and non loaded questions when you start a new thread. For example, for the first thread, you could ask "What do you think about Obama's work as president?" For the second one, you can just say "How do you see Microsoft as a company in terms of customer treatment?" For the third one, you can just stick your genitals into an electrical socket. (3) Don't include your own opinion in the opening post *Are you for or against interracial marriage? I'm against it because it's wrong and immoral. *What's your favorite console? I think X-Box 360 is by far the best. Lastly, when you ask a question and then immediately shove your opinion into the discussion, you look like an *******. This board is not a place for you to just shout your opinion out and then leave threads. If you want to begin a discussion, start by creating an interesting discussion and showing both sides of the arguments, or just simply ask a question. By stating your opinion first, people who disagree are likely just going to counter your ideas instead of first outlining their argument. The argument has already been crushed under the weight of your work. In general, threads containing long opening posts full of horrible misinformed arguments and Youtube videos that are supposed to act as citations should be avoided. Thank you all for reading. Hopefully A4 can be a little better now. 
 
 I honestly don't see anything wrong with: (3) Don't include your own opinion in the opening post. The whole point is so that they start discussing what they thing is right/wrong with that and what they think, then you can have turns rebutting/adding details.

 Agreed with everything except the whole 'don't post your opinion thing'. Most users don't know how to interject their opinions without being an ass, I'll admit... But I think some people are able to give their opinions while still starting discussion. Otherwise, the majority of thread makers on this site could learn from this. Too bad they'll just ignore it and continue to make bad threads.

Sure if you say that every other console sucks well that would change it or if you are very pushy like- it is the best ever! Anyone who disagree is a idiot. Well that would also change the matter since those statements might upset and anger people. I think it´s good to tell people of your own view of the subject you are asking or talking about since it gives a better insight of what the topic really is about. It leaves less place for missunderstandings. Originally Posted by Pured I honestly don't see anything wrong with: (3) Don't include your own opinion in the opening post. I agree...

 Stating an opinion in the opening post, I think is A good idea because other users who post on the topic know the standing point of the OP and whether they agree or disagree with it, I think it will get the discussion going. I however, don't like to add my opinion when I make threads personally. I think A big thought that should be considered when making threads, is certain topics, I believe requires an OP that is informed on the topic before they post it. I think when the is OP involved in the discussion then that is A good way to keep the thread going. We should aim to make all threads fire topics. XD

 Depending on how the post is worded, answering your own proposed question sends the message that you made the thread without the intention of starting a discussion or hearing the opinions of others, but rather to simply share your own opinion on the topic and then possibly defend it should others disagree with you--if you're even invested in the thread enough to continue beyond simply sharing your opinion. I say it depends on the wording of the post only because it can be done in a way that it doesn't come off that way, but it usually does, so it was likely just easier for Buddy to say not to do it at all.

 1, I agree with, 2 and 3 not so much. And it's kind of pointless to bring up any serious topics, they're all one sided. All in all good thread and hopefully even the vets learn from this as well as thew newbies.

 The problem with including your opinion in the opening post is that it leads the discussion. If you're trying to have an objective conversation this is not the way to go. 

 I know what you mean but if you think a certain thread is (bad) then just ignore it , easy answer.

 I stand by my words on #3. Like KT said, throwing in your own opinion in the OP just leads the discussion to a certain place. If you can't ask a question without shoving your own opinion into it, I have to wonder: are you starting the thread because you want to start a discussion, or are you just asking a question so you can talk about your own opinion? After a few other members post their own opinions I think it's OK for the original poster to throw his or hers in, but from the start is just a poor way to start talking about an issue. I know what you mean but if you think a certain thread is (bad) then just ignore it , easy answer. No, you don't know what I mean. You didn't read the thread. The purpose of this thread is to improve the overall quality of this board. Your comment is completely irrelevant. 
 In regards to the opinion aspect. I think it depends on how the opinion is presented. For example if after submitting all the information for the thread, the op submits their opinion and then gives a detailed explanation as to why they came to the conclusion, I don't see an issue. However when someone posts a thread, and then follows it up with an opinion that is about as detailed as "I think x is idiotic" or "I think x is the most brilliant thing ever", or it is clearly an emotional based opinion; and then they provide no reasoning as to the opinion, then the opinion should not be included. Basically if you are going to state an opinion, state why you have the opinion in a clear and thought out manner. The same could be said for most posts...think about why you are posting before you post. Save the ADHD moments for twitter.

I have read your thread very good and i know what you mean by it , im not some 12 year old kid. To be more acurate this thread is as you said also irrelevant since i think you cant change it , im also new in this forums and i dont make some silly threads as other (maybe i did then i apologize to all people who readed my silly thread(. People want know what your or mine opinion about an certain anime , situation you found interesting so they make ,,bad,, threads. Just let them be , they will realize soon what they did and it will stop by it self or you wanna fight with them? Dont wanna argument it anymore.

So that's why I always sucked at topic creation! Originally Posted by BuddyLee After a few other members post their own opinions I think it's OK for the original poster to throw his or hers in, but from the start is just a poor way to start talking about an issue. Bare minimum, this method helps see how many people are actually interested in a topic or let's them know they're doing something correct without expending too much time and effort on the worthless.

Yes I do not agree with it....to an extent. If it is going to be a discussion like about a chapter for a manga then Normally unless you think the chapter had enough for you to talk about with others enough to where you making a second post to comment on others or point something else out later. Then Yes, Put your opinions in. However I guess I agree with an news article or something that is a topic of extended discussion (not an actual extended discussion). Then You should wait for a few posts before making your opinion known and leave off with something like. What is your opinion on this matter or subjects? Your view points etc. Then post later on thus leading the discussion further.

 I agree with #1 and #2 BUT #3 doesn't convince me. I believe you can share your opinion with others from the beginning without affecting the discussion. A good poster knows better than just saying "I agree completely" or "You suck for this" if they agree or disagree with the position the OP has. There's no science to it, I think is more about not being stupid... but like you mentioned, even if its harsh, some people are just too stupid to comprehend these things (it should be common sense). Well, I'm glad a thread like this came up, because I have seen lots of posts&threads that are ... well... stupid to say the least -_- And even if it might offend someone, it should serve as a heads up, for the ones who used to make bad quality threads/posts and actually take the time to read and put in practice your tips.

 I'm not exactly sure on how someone could disagree with #3. Your job as a discussion starter is to start an open discussion--not crush one. Options can be presented reasonably in the OP, but why? The presence of one is usually very stifling and intrusive. If you can't wait an hour to present your own opinion, your dedication to the thread is very low. It depends on the type of thread, but if you're going to do it, at least present the opposition's opinion in a reasonable manner. 
 I've noticed some people post threads and never come back. However most people do, especially me, if I make or visit a thread, I will come back if I find it on Latest Posts.

 The person who makes the topic should present: 1) Topic - A brief description of the subject. 2) Discussion - A quick overview of factors/considerations pertaining to the subject. They can be expressed in different view points or just delineated forthright. 3) Recommendation - Present an elementary position to begin the discussion (a belief or conclusion) or further refine the Discussion to facilitate conversation. Establish a rebuttable presumption of sorts, it doesn't have to be prima facie, but reasonable. 4) Moderate - Guide the discussion as it evolves.

 @ Buddy, I feel an opinion needs to be part of the op almost as a level of accountability. In the sense that it shows the op actually read the article/news item and understood what the point was. Otherwise we get threads where it is just someone throwing up an article, and you have no idea why they felt it was important to post. Was it because they felt it contained material that people should be aware of and discuss? Was it because they just want to post something for shock value? Or did they post something, because they had a derp TMZ moment and thought it was worth sharing with others? It still comes back to the original point I was trying to make though. By adding in your opinion and the "why" aspect, you are letting others at least know why you posted the article, and why it is worth discussing. It also may help to clarify the point of the article to some other users. A well justified opinion can be devoid of bias ( neutral point of view based solely on the facts presented ). Of course the above requires someone to actual pay attention and put work into their op. Now I realize many users just dump things out there that equate to drivel, however do we let the actions of the lazy dictate the actions of those that put thought into their posts?
