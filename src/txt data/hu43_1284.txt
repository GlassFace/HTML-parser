[Mystery] Danganronpa
 Based on a murder mystery visual novel developed by Spike exclusively for Japan. Originally Posted by Synopsis The story takes place at Hope's Peak Academy, an illustrious private school that only accepts "super" students: the best of the best of the best. The criteria extends to any niche, so in addition to super-geniuses and super-athletes, they take super-idols, gang leaders, and geeks. Makoto Naegi, the protagonist, is still baffled as to how he got in, as his only outstanding trait seems to be his super "good" luck - and that's only because he was randomly chosen to be accepted by the school. In fact, he hasn't even started his first day of school when he suddenly loses consciousness and wakes up in a creepy alternate version of the academy. It's soon revealed that Naegi and fourteen other new students have all been abducted by a sadistic teddy bear named Monobear, who refuses to let them leave. The only way out of the locked-down dark school is to graduate...by killing another student. Once a murder is committed, Monobear holds a trial so that the class can try to figure out which one of them is the culprit, culminating in a vote. If they make the right choice, the murderer will be messily executed. Make the wrong choice, and not only does the murderer escape, but the rest of them will take the punishment in their place...

 Apparently it aired yesterday, and funi has it, but as of right now they haven't put it up yet. Please do, I'm dying of anticipation. See, I read a lets play of the game, and it was super sweet, so I want to see how the anime holds up. 

 Well it's not very well done, I don't feel the despair, but everything else looks good...I can't see anyone killing each other off though. Plus this feels like Saw and I've never liked those movies...I'll probably drop this by episode 3 but I am willing to give it a small chance. Over all it's pretty poor from my point of view.

 It's interesting to say the least! This whole Battle Royale theme seems quite popular in Japan, lol. I'm interested to see how it carries on to the mystery part with the trials and all.

 First episode was pretty good; I'm looking forward to seeing what the students will do next. :3 Very suspenseful stuff.

 Ok, so I found the premise stupid, the protagonist is offensively boring, there is nothing interesting about the rest of the cast, and the introduction scene was grating. I don't think I'll even make it to three episodes here, what an awful show. I'll have to assume the game is just leaps and bounds better or else it has one of the least deserved fanbases ever. 

 The shows animation is a little on the weird side for, but it is a new experience so I'll watch it through. The principle is kind of annoying and dumb to be honest, I don't really mind the rest of the characters, I'm interested in seeing how the story will progress though. 
 I liked it. I was surprised that episode one didn't go farther than it did, but it's good so far. I'm really glad it was animated, because reading it on SomethingAwful was annoying, what with their paywall blocking it for weeks sometimes. Plus the fact that the game won't release in English until next year. So I'm excited to keep watching it, even if it is a little over the top. xD 
 
 I'm not going to continue on to the second episode of this anime, I have too many good animes to watch this season and I never did like this one even from the summary plus first episode was s*it so moving on. I hope you guys enjoy this dull one.

 The fact that two of them were killed off so soon kinda threw me off, but I don't actually believe that the both of them are actually dead. 
 I don't know about you guys, but the first episode really reeled me in . Also, I like that I don't have to concern myself with keeping track of new characters that might show up, since they're all introduced at the beginning. I do think the pacing is a bit off though. Imo, a few seconds from the second episode aren't enough to represent the investigation sequences from the game :x. Otherwise, I don't see where the hate is coming from. 
 4th episode was great. Looking forward to more!  Spoiler Anyone want to take a guess at who the murderer this time is? :P Obviously, don't answer if you've played the game already xD

 I really like it, I've been a fan these survival games, can't wait for more!

 I read the visual novel on somethingawful and it was ****ing amazing, I encourage everyone to watch it. Some of the murders are played straight, with the killer being obvious... and some others are tricky.
