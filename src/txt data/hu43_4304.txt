[Anime] the worst anime u have ever watched!!
 School Days was just bad I've heard of the MC getting girls he couldn't handle (Every Male MC Harem ever), but I've never seen girls so stupid in my life The MC (I forgot his name) treats all those girls like straight crap, and the girls were just OK with it, and more of them flocked to him The only character I liked was the shy girl who went with him first, and she was really the only victim in the story, but her personality was butchered in the last episode. The killing was completely unnecessary. Also, there Freezing Vibration. I ended up watching this before Freezing, which was the first season, so I didn't watch the first season at all. While the fighting scenes were decent, nothing really happened. I might've just been ignorant since I didn't watch the first season, but I was confused as hell for the entire anime
