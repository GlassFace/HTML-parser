 See the above? Read it. We have a usergroup for PLD banned people, that's why this forum is separate from GNAD. If you behave like an idiot in this section, you will be banned from it. That simple. If you don't want to read teenage problems or whatever, don't click on this sub-forum, and certainly, don't post in it.
