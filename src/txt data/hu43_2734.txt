[General Discussion] What words or phrases should be banned from everyday life?
 So what words or phrases drive you craze? I mean ones that are used way too often? I guess this is more of a New Years thread since that's when they usually talk about words that should be banned. But I want to get a headstart. Ok for me: SELFIES! Yuck.... hate that word..... Umm... that's about all I've got right at the moment. How about you? What words and or phrases do you wish would disappear from the media and the average citizen?
