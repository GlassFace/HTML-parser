 looks like rihanna, right?
 I have to say I love that song. Too bad it did not get any award from any music show. Heard that there was an unfair miscalculation on InkiGayo and they were supposed to get the mutizen instead of 2PM, it would've been their first award too. ;-; **Edit** And oh, she doesn't look like Rihanna, Amber freaks me out. >.> Ever since they debuted. 
Thanks for the avatar Amoo :3
