 Prepare to have it completely blown away. http://code.google.com/p/quake2-gwt-port/ It's a Quake2 port. That runs entirely in the browser. On existing browser APIs and libraries and HTML5. To some, this is actually kind of a really big deal, particularly because these libraries and the HTML5 specification are ideally going to eventually be platform-independent and implemented in most major browsers. It goes to show that this is a lot more powerful than people are giving it credit for. For developers, the direction we're headed in with HTML5 tears down an enormous wall. For users, it opens up new avenues for rich, interactive content. And the big three - Microsoft, Apple, and Google - are all 100% on-board for what's to come (With some differences in implementation details, of course). The browser has already become a primary source for high-definition television, sports, movies, and music. It is our social channel, where we keep our photos and documents, where the most non-SMS messages are sent in the entire world, where the overwhelming majority of the world's games (Although they're lame Facebook games) are now played. This stuff is pushing the envelope. Combine this all with increased network efficiency and more widespread network coverage and suddenly the prospect of a cloud-based or browser-based operating system doesn't seem all that crazy.
