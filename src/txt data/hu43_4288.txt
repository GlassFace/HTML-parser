[Anime] Why do people run with their arms to their sides at a low angle in anime's?
 I first noticed this while watching naruto. I then realized they do it in black butler. I've also spotted it in infinite stratos. Is it to imply they are going really fast? Or is it some nod to some ninja or martial arts technique I don't know about? Or is it just something unique to anime that has no real reason behind it? I'm sure they do this in loads of other anime's. These are just ones I've noticed it in. Thanks for any insight. Sample from imgarcade of naruto running: Â Spoiler
