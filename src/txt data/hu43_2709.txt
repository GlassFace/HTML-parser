[Fantasy] Nanatsu no Taizai (The Seven Deadly Sins)
 Synopsis: The Seven Deadly Sins were once an active group of knights in the region of Britannia (ブリタニア), who disbanded after they supposedly plotted to overthrow the Liones Kingdom (リオネス王国). Their supposed defeat came at the hands of the Holy Knights, but rumors continued to persist that they were still alive. Ten years later, the Holy Knights staged a coup d'état and capture the king, becoming the new, tyrannical rulers of the kingdom. The third princess, Elizabeth, then starts on a journey to find the Seven Deadly Sins, and to enlist their help in taking back the kingdom. The Seven Deadly Sins (七つの大罪 Nanatsu no Taizai) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Nakaba Suzuki. It has been serialized in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine since October 2012, with the chapters collected into nine tankōbon volumes as of June 17, 2014. The manga features a setting similar to the European Middle Ages, with its titular group of knights representing the seven deadly sins. As of August 2014, The Seven Deadly Sins had over 5 million copies in circulation. It is currently being adapted into a television anime by A-1 Pictures that will debut on October 5, 2014. The manga has been licensed by Kodansha Comics USA for English publication in North America, while the chapters are released digitally by Crunchyroll in over 170 countries as they are published in Japan. Hobby Japan and figures maker OrchidSeed's Seven Deadly Sins franchise has taken the next step towards corrupting mankind with a new, non-18+ anime series based on the Niθ (Queen's Blade's Alice, Samurai Girls) designed line of girls personifying the capital vices. Queen's Blade designer Hiraku Kaneko (Leina Vance, Cattleya) directs the production, reuniting writer Makoto Uezu (Humanity Has Declined) after sharing the same duties on Qwaser of Stigmata.

 Saw it just now and the art style is similar to Akira Toriyama's, not entirely but similar. Other than that it looks promising. I'm going a bit off topic now but I love that autumn's season is clustered fantasy themed shows. There is something about watching knights, castles, swords clashing and dark magic that moves me.

 Its gonna be adventure themed series I guess? Looks promising with an overpowered mc.

 It was a lot better than I expected, honestly. It got pretty cool at the ending, and has some decent action, and I like the characters. Will see where it goes. 

 I'm really liking this so far! It gives me a bit of a feel of Akame ga Kill, actually. One thing that I don't think will be like Akame is how quickly people die. Though apparently, people in this show have died when they died...

 I know it's standard in pretty much all anime, but I couldn't help to notice Diane wore the same clothes 10 years ago...and that triggered a silly train of thought for me.
