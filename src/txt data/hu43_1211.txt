 Band of Horses - The Funeral 
  Spoiler 
 this is what I would play at my funeral: fire treasure/treasures of time by yuji ohno either the smooth sax version or the one with English lyrics so people can understand it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a8WYdPMbQc http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj8E-2U74oI

 Classic top comment that's been plagiarized by a lot of people who think they're funny and original by taking credit for somebody else's work: At my funeral there is going to be﻿ a closed casket and it will be opened only to reveal that I'm not in there. Instead they will turn on the ceiling fan and my lifeless body will swing around the room with the space jam theme song playing in the background. 
 3 Days after the funeral play this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RScYA_fBqKY

 Start playing that sad Enya song, but about 15 seconds into it, interrupt it with no warning whatsoever and play GG Allin's "Suck My A-- It Smells". I want to go out lulzing. 
 Sorry I'll top all those songs 
 Everything you see belongs to me, to one degree or another. The beggars and newsboys and quick thieves here in Paradise, the sailor dives and gin mills and blind tigers on the waterfront, the anglers and amusers, the she-hes and the Chinks. Everybody owes, everybody pays. Because that's how you stand up against the rising of the tide. *Bill The Butcher - Gangs Of New York* 
 In recent days, I've changed mine up a bit. I'm going to go with "Americana" by Jay Gruska. Artist: Jay Gruska. Song: Americana. Album: Supernatural OST. 
Individual Eleven: Rise Up. Never conform.

Haha, I would totally have this, just for the facial expressions. Otherwise, I'd have one sad song - http://youtu.be/0ODDtLMiGnY Then lots of happy songs from Panic At The Disco and Cobra Starship <3

 I've always sucked at goodbyes, I can never even say it. I just say "see ya later". Plus everyone in my family knows how much my Dad always respected Johnny Cash. It would really be fitting for this song to play.  Spoiler 
~ My level of sarcasm is to a point where I don't even know if I'm kidding or not.
 My List Of Funeral Songs: 1) Ryan Star - Losing Your Memory  Spoiler 2) AnoHana - Last Train Home  Spoiler 3) Coldplay - The Scientist  Spoiler 4) Sword Art Online - Survive the Swordland  Spoiler 5) The Moldy Peaches - Anyone Else But You  Spoiler 6) Treasure Planet - I'm Still Here  Spoiler 7) Celtic Women - Send Me A Song  Spoiler Quest for Camelot -I Stand Alone  Spoiler 9)Lord of the Rings - Into the West  Spoiler 10) Angel Beats - My Song  Spoiler 11) Sara Bareilles - Gravity  Spoiler 12) Flyleaf - Believe in Dreams  Spoiler 13) Scala and Kolacny Brothers - With or Without You  Spoiler 14) Wicked - For Good  Spoiler Yes, I know that there are many songs listed above. Yet, every song I listed has had a large impact on my life so far. Whether it is because of an anime that I relate to, a choir that reminds me of my own, a song that I sing along with almost everyday, something to do with my love situation, my first musical that grasped me into the world of singing, or even a song that I grew up with... Every single song up there is a definition of me. Music has really touched me in life, and when I pass away I want those standing back while my ashes are being blown away (I am going to be cremated) to listen to the sort of life I lived and the sort of person I was. I would have listed My Sanctuary from KingdomHearts but there is not a version on youtube in English.

 I would like to have Symph Lizard conduct a live concert band playing Robert Smith's Ascension. For my Dad' funeral, we played music we knew he loved. We played Norman Greenbaum's Spirit in the Sky, Allison Krauss and Robert Plant's Your Long Journey, and Annie Lennox's Into the West. For the slideshow of pictures from his life, the background was Pink Floyd's Shine On You Crazy Diamond. And No, I'm Not Posting Vids Because I Can't Youtube At Work.

I've been partial to stuff like this lately:  Spoiler I'm all about a wake at this point, man. Although I keep coming back to the Lauridsen Lux Aeterna, too. That's just fantastic.

 It should be quite obvious what im going to play at my funeral  Spoiler Spoilers

 Gangnam Style or anything fun. But I would really want people to dress up as grim reapers at my funeral.
