 iPhone 4
 Unless you've been living in a tech cave for the last few months, you've heard about the prototype iPhone left in a Redmond City bar by Grey Powell, the invasion of privacy against Gizmodo's editor, and the second prototype iPhone found in Vietnam. My question is, what's next? What do you think would be the best move for Apple? Personally, instead of sueing Gizmodo, which Apple seems set to do, I think Apple just needs to get over it and announce their new phone. "The Summer of 4G" is coming up fast, and the longer they wait, the longer it is till Apples profits recover. They complain about loss of profits? Well, just announce the new model iPhone and you'll make up those profits when you start selling them. The only reason profits are down is because people are waiting to buy the new phone instead of the old one. They arn't switching to Droid. At least that's what I think. Second topic: What do you think of the new iPhone / OS 4? Personally, I'm sad I already have my 3Gs, but i'll live. Still the best phone out there. Very excited about OS4 too. Can't it come out sooner? Gen iPhone discussion too.
