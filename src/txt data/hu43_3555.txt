[Fantasy] Tales of Zestiria: Doushi no Yoake
 Nothing special noted about this one, but that it's the TV anime adaptation of Bandai Namco Games' Tales of Zestiria role-playing game. Considering that we've had some really good recent adaptations of such RPG games, this might be worth a look-see. Plus, this adaptation is done by ufotable! I still haven't come down off the high of that awesome Fate/Stay Night adaptation from them! <3
