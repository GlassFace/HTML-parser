 Ha! Suck it other people who were nominated in my categories but didn't win. Because I did. Bring on the winners perks. Like not having to view those intrusive and creepy as hell ads. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Thank you!!!!!!! Though ned probably should have won best contributor for his new show threads. But I'm glad he won one of the polls. I look forward to contributing to the forum again this year. Hey I've already past my one year anniversary!!!!!

 Let's get some wine where the drums? 
Cyber-crime, corporate espionage, political corruption, and open super-human attacks in the technology capital of Alpha City, the Tech District. Meanwhile, group suicides and active hauntings, as well as the sightings of monsters leave a bloody mark on the organized-crime ridden wards of the Glam District and its plethora of celebrities, beaches and penthouses. Alpha City may just fall apart. Unless, heroes start arriving to protect the innocent? Perhaps you want to join in on the chaos and turmoil while you bask in the spoils?

 I was surprised that I got nominated for funniest member. But now that feeling is gone as I only got one vote... And it was mine Oh well.. That just means I'll have to do better next year. Congrats everybody who won!

 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses. Beside you as you like softly down, I will be until I hear the words "Checkmate". ~Sebastian Michaelis ~ Individual 4 ~ A4's Greatest Villain <Right Here Lmao 
 I didn't get a single PM, Skype message or Facebook whine about this whole thing, so I am happy. Last year was fugging insane for me. It could have been a bit more eventful and fun though, but I guess... small mercies.

If you would have smacked me and been like yo nessa nominate me for something I would have, or you could have bribed me with sweets lol
