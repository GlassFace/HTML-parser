 Your opinion about diseases
 This is a bad thread. OP try to think a little bit harder before posting in the future, so you don't make any more bad threads! Certainly it's okay to ask questions, but forming a reasonable basis for your ideas is key! Suggesting that we need fewer cures to allow diseases to wipe out larger portions of humanity is ignorant if not evil and just not founded on any sort of solid understanding of environmental, social, or political sustainability.
