 Bluray & Anime

Because I started Witchblade via digital download.. not in HD format.. and the difference is clear the sound just comes in better. Only do it if you've got the money.. its more a luxury than anything. I'd also have to rethink some buys if I started seeing those Digital Copy features on the anime Blurays since they come with a free DL and a DVD with it. But it's still alot more. I'd have to love that anime alot for me to spend that kinda money. I don't see that happening anytime soon.
