 Rivalle, in denial of loving One Direction. For me... there are quite a few songs that piss me of because I don't like them or they are annoying, but you hear it a few times and start to like it ;_; The most obvious/recent one I can identify is Baddest Female by CL. I love CL, and I love 2NE1, but... that song was rubbish imo... but after a few listens I was like... naeganaeganaeganaega <- That's my korean singing impersonation.

 Hot 'n Cold by Katy Perry. Awful, awful trash. About as intelligent and well composed as a retard in ice skates. Sung by one of the godmothers of pop musics disgusting stagnation into technology/talent confused, hedonistic, artistically empty, consumerism dictated sh*t. But f*ck me, it's a catchy song with a cool beat. I ran to that **** for hours when it came out, haha.
