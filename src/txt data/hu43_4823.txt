 What are your top five favorite games
 In no order in particular. Left 4 Dead 2 - I love the co-op. Other games have co-op too, but not like this. You are completely reliant on your teammates when you are attacked by special infected. It's just so satisfying to heal people or save them from special infected. Resident Evil 4 - I'm a big RE fan, but I honestly think this is the best Resident Evil game of all time. I must have beaten this game over 20 times. Telltale's The Walking Dead - I think this game has one of the best stories out there when it comes to video games. I really admire the writers of the game and how they manage to keep it interesting. Gears of War 3 - I love this game and have probably put more hours into this than any other game I own on the Xbox 360. I love TDM and having gnasher battles with people. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater - I'm a big Metal Gear fan, so finally being able to play a Metal Gear with "Big Boss" in it was pretty amazing. Streets of Rage 2 - This is probably my favorite beat-em up of all time. It has one of the best soundtracks of any Sega Genesis game and memorable boss fights.
