[Asian Music] K-pop Anyone? - Page 4
 Yeah, EYK aren't English teachers anymore. I find myself listening to Kpop more and more when I get depressed. Is that a bad thing?

 I used to like kpop because of the music channels here in my country. Every freagin' time and everywhere they playing kpop music And then I started to get annoyed to it and I realize that Jpop is much better than kpop. and yeah their dancing skills are awesome too . 
 I've never had a taste for Jpop. It's too.... I don't know. I mean, I like some of it. Most of the Japanese girls I know love AKB48 with a passion, but my taste in Japanese music has always leaned towards bands like Sakanaction. Also, Japanese guys in boy bands kind of.. scare me. Pfft. I'm not really a girl group person. I've tried getting into Jpop multiple times but it's never worked.
