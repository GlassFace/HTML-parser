 Wrong Cosplay?
 I've heard a lot of people complain when someone goes to a comic book convention dressed as an anime character. But I hear just as many complaints when someone goes to an anime convention dressed like Batman for instance. It seems strange that it would even matter to some people what character you cosplay as. To me cosplay is cosplay. What do you think? Should anime cosplayers stick to anime conventions and vice versa, or should you be allowed to cosplay how you want at any convention you want?
