[Anime] Would you be interested in a special gender bender Attack on Titan episode?
 I just wanted to ask to see what other people think. If they made a special gender bender episode for Attack on Titan, would you be interested in watching it? Honestly, I think it would be really cool to see them make that. I am curious to see how they would portray how the characters would sound and act. I know they would have the same personalities, but I would just love to see how it would ACTUALLY play out.
