 Havelyns, hexers, Santier's Spear, Bat Staff, Syan's Halberd, Monastery Scimitar, and the dw greataxes are all being hit. What will everyone use in pvp now? All their copy/paste "builds" are being nerfed! Meh. I shelved DkS2 weeks ago. Quickly fell out of interest in it once I played the previous games in the series and came to learn how shitty DkS2 is in comparison. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

Not criticising your thoughts but what parts do you believe fell below the bar in comparison to the previous games?

Atmosphere, music, level design and world cohesion, enemy design and variety (bosses especially), lore, movement (DkS2 is so floaty), the almost complete irrelevance of poise and defense (Fashion Souls is fun, but it should be an option, not pretty much the only choice), the need to return to Majula to level, and it was just so watered-down in the difficulty department. Oh, and narrative clarity -- Dark Souls isn't known for its strong narrative by any means, but at least you get the gist of things on your own, with many more things within the lore to explore and speculate on. Dark Souls 2 takes this to a moronic new level of ambiguity, and I honestly question whether the writers have any idea what they're doing, or if they just make **** up as they go along. I could probably go on -- oh yeah, Miyazaki. DkS2 lacked Miyazaki, and it could be argued (and it has by many), that his absence is the reason for all/most of the above perceived problems and deficiencies. I just hope Project Beast turns out to be Demon's Souls 2, or something new ("Beast Souls" is a title thrown around a lot by people, since Project Dark became Dark Souls), because I don't know what kind of future Dark Souls will have if a potential DkS3 is at all like DkS2.

 Dark Souls 2 is great. But thus far I agree that its the weakest in the series. Still, it adds some new curve balls to the system and it expands a little on customization. Some cool ideas that are not fully realized. I think From does a good job of making the games very similarity, but adding something that gives every game a different identity. I like the lore alright (i really liked the licia thing) They didnt **** it up. And I shelved it the second I finished my first run, but I dont think thats much of a black mark. In one of his videos vidya vaati speculated that project beast could actually be a shadow tower(ps1) game. But it should be in the same vein of a souls game anyway.
