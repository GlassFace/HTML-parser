[Anime] Has the kind of anime being made changed? Is anime going down hill?
 I'm still very new to the anime scene, but i'm learning more and more every day. I was watching some video on youtube about 2 weeks ago, and this guy was talking about how the anime scene is going down hill. Theres no more brand new series like naruto or pokemon, to lure kids in. I mean they still make episodes of naruto and pokemon I think but there isn't like a brand new anime series on the level of those. Its like there relying on the old stuff which is getting well old. There also isn't any new series that can compare to death note, or serial experiments of lain or dragon ball z. No more movies on the level of princess mononoke or akira, ghost in the shell. This is what the guy said in the video. I watched the first 5 episodes of sword art online I thought it was good. But it seemed to be for a younger audience. I didn't care for the color scheme either. I liked the angel beats color scheme but not that one. Do they still make seroius style animes? Is anime going down hill since cartoon network has taken off toonami? Or does that guy not know what he's talking about?

 Lets face it. Anime is indeed going downhill. Its simply not as popular as it once was. Cartoon Network changed and after that the majority (including myself) of people lost interest in anime. They took down Toonami and put a bunch of child like cartoons up in its place. Its true that Cartoon Network is not the ONLY place to get anime from, but it was what a lot of people turned to to get it. I myself lost interest in it for a long while, and when I did come back to the anime scene, I sadly discovered it mostly lives in the internet. This is all simply my opinion. I would love to read what other people post in reply. 
 Anime it primarily Japanese animation. It's popularity in other parts of the world may go up and down depending on trends but I think it's level of quality is probably pretty stable. Technology may be able to improve the quality of the artwork and animation but it is up to the writers skills to make it interesting. Some will be good and some will be ...... less good. I think the downhill trend mentioned is really just a matter of individual perception. 

 In all honesty, I don't really believe it is going down hill. Then again that is what I believe, I am not every other person. Meeting more and more people each day who are in love with anime, and I see lots of posting about it all over the web. Yet that is the problem, like C0R1 said, the anime industry is mostly on the internet. Though, the more and more people who get netflix, the more anime is seen because I have met many people who started watching thanks to Netflix. I fully disagree on your view of SAO, it not only directs the younger audience but the older as well. I have met quite a few of adults who enjoy SAO. Its plot is unique, and they put it together very well. Popular animes like Clannad, Angel Beats, Ouran Highschool Host Club, Death Note, Ano Hana, Black Butler, SAO, Guilty Crown... they may not be as popular as Dragonball Z or even Pokemon. The reason why to me is because it is for all audiences- Kids, teenagers, and adults. Animes today are especially targeted towards teenagers and adults so they do not really put them on Cartoon Network or maybe even 4kids(They are not that bad they screw with anime a little). It doesn't mean Anime is becoming less popular, it means that there is so many different varieties of anime out there now that not only one is being talked about at a time. It is all of them they we talk about, choose our favorites and move on to see what else is out there to catch our interest and make us think. Many years ago, there wasn't much anime to actually sit down and watch but the ones that were there made it big. They were introductions and classics. Now here we are with thousands of different animes and plots, how could anyone expect us to only make one such a big deal and crown it? I could go on and on, but it is mostly my view so I am going to end my comment here .

 There were always shitty anime, decent anime and anime we call ,,masterpiece,, . I dont think anime is getting worse actually better , good example is Attack on Titan started reading manga and its just awesome. Everyone has a different opinion about this. 
 
 After reading MyaMeOhMy's post, I have have a slightly different opinion on this now. Perhaps anime is not directed toward appropriate age groups? Maybe that's why it feels like it could be dying out? Thank you MyaMeOhMy and Finfan for speaking on this.

 I like these responses. Yeah I guess I should give sword art online a second chance. I'm very new to this whole thing. I know a lot of people who don't even have cable or satilete tv any more. They just use hulu vudu and netflix. thats actaully how I discovered anime. I guess the way its going to be exposed to new comers is evolving, because of technology. smart tvs being made, playstation, xbox. Thanks for the input. any one know of any more serious animes over the past few years?

Thanks for the input. any one know of any more serious animes over the past few years? Lets see best anime from (only my opinion): 2010 - Legend of the Legendary Heroes , Angel Beats , HOTD , Kuroshitsuji , Shiki 2011 - Guilty Crown , Fate/Zero , Mayo Chiki , Gosick , Beelzebub , Mirai Nikki , Last Exile , Mashiro-iro Symphony, Hidan no Aria 2012 - Psycho Pass , Zetsuen no Tempest , Oda nobuna no Yabou , Accel World , Another , Black Rock Shooter , Say I Love You , Jormungand , SAO?( not a big fan of this serie) My opinion as i said. 
 
 I think Samurai Champloo is a great anime for a serious watcher. Givin' my 2 cents there. 
 I think i posted this before but whatever: There will be Legendary anime like Death Note (2006), Code Geass (200 and Steins Gate (2011). There will be Cool anime like Ao No Exorcist, Darker than black and FMA Brotherhood. There will be funny anime like FMP: Fumoffu, Arakawa under the bridge and Samurai Champloo. And there will be loads of crap. EvErY. FrIkKiN. DeCaDe. You just have to know where to look for it x) 

 Bad anime hasn't increased, it's just reached critical mass and converged into an all-consuming pile of moe high school "comedy" sh*t. There's still lots of good stuff released, the bad stuff just all looks the same. Which is an advantage really, it's easier to filter. Death Note, Lain, and DBZ aren't even terribly good in my opinion, certainly not the best shows of ther time. Give Fate/Zero, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Madoka Magica, Tiger & Bunny, Steins;Gate, Mawaru Penguindrum, Nodame Cantabile, or Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt a shot for some recent shows that blow the three you listed out of the water. Hell, this season alone we've got Gargantia and Advance on Titan which are both excellent. 

 What video were you watching? It sounds like one of those animu elite samas. Honestly, bad anime series will always hang around us. There are many factors in making a great anime series and the budget is most often what determines how good a show is. There are a lot of great series that came out recently and aren't just cater to younger audiences as well. Type-moon is one of the biggest drivers in the more mature series in my opinion. Shows like FSN/zero, Canaan, Kara no Kyoukai, Tsukihime etc weren't exactly "kiddie" shows. And let's not forget rotorscopes in this spring season lol I mean maybe compared to older and hand drawn anime series, the animation qualities are very different. We went from hand drawing everything to CG everything. I don't have that big of a problem with this personally, but I do know that some older fans hate how everything is made with CG now.

 It's been stated already but there's always going to be bad anime, good anime and absolutely amazing anime series. Many people will be of the opinion that todays anime is falling. When really it's not when you start comparing each anime to others you have seen then YES it will seem like the writers were doing a half ass job because you are comparing. Your expecting. Each anime is Unique feel. If you dont go in with a clear mind with an unjudgemental state then your going to disapprove 9/10 times. Me? I think anime is as strong as it has always been. Peoples expectations are just to damn high these days.

 Hey Thanks you guys. I watched a ton of trailers for current anime. I do notice with the computer technology a huge improvement. I'm sorry If this has been asked before. I'm glad anime is still alive and strong! I hope it lasts forever!

 I don't think anime is going downhill at all, the different genre of series that are being pushed out now are meant to target all different types of viewers. What you like is what you'll ultimately end up watching, It really just comes down to personal preference. As far as the series you've mentioned, there different from the anime being put out now and you really can't compare them to something like death note. Death note is a Shonen anime, and as of late there hasn't been any new shonen anime so something like that can't really compare to anime put out by companies smaller than Shonen Jump. 
 I don't think anime is going downhill. If anything, it would just seem that way because it has been done before, I mean, after so many years, its harder to be original and creative and unique. Many things will have been seen before in previous anime. If you were young and you were to watch the newer anime, before watching the older ones, you would think they are amazing and that the older ones aren't that good. + These days, animation and graphic quality have been improved.

 Anime isn't as original as it once was. Other than being based on manga, now you see them being based on book, games, movies, etc (For example, Sword Art Online which is based on a series of novels). Original ideas are a rare thing these days. Plus, as Pured said. There is just so much anime now that its hard to make an original idea. You make something that slightly resembles another anime and people will automatically judge it against that. Though I don't think it's going 'down hill'. There will always be good and bad anime. Technology is constantly evolving, so we are seeing newer and newer styles being released.

 Keeping my opinion simple, it all comes down to the individual's taste. I'm really picky with what anime I prefer to enjoy more - the recent anime from 2010 to now is what intrigues me. I think this year is the year anime tries to experiment with better, new and innovative themes/genres/characters etc (displayed in SAO for example) 
 
 Like everything, the only thing that's really changed about anime lately is that it's incredibly easy to get and the fans are louder than ever. And most fans have horrendous taste that the rest of us have to put up with while we wade through the muck looking for something worth our time. Shows like Mushi-shi are relatively obscure while garbage like Shakugan no Shana or K-ON enjoy incredible popularity and their fans are the loudest of all. 

 I don't really think anime is going downhill, its just harder to find the good animes because anime is not as mainstream as it was in the toonami heyday. However I have found that the people on this forum have great advice depending on what you're looking for. 

 Anime is here and there mainstream wise, but the quality has certainly declined overtime, it's quite difficult to find an anime that isn't sprinkled with fan service all over it. You'll get at least 2 that stand out a year, but that's about it. 
 If he's just looking for mainstream fodder, WTF is he talking about, there's like 2 "newer" series out, has he not heard of Bleach, and One Piece lol. You so need to look harder, the industry Isn't going down hill, it just happens, that unlike during the golden age, this time around, most of the high quality anime are obscure/hidden gems. In short, that guy doesn't know WTF he is talking about. There are far more dramas being made these days, where before there were virtually none(outside of small movies), but that's in addition to all the anime types they have always been making, not instead.

Oh please - Every year Japan produces between 70 and 120 NEW anime series with another 50+ Series continuing from last year - and some of the newer series are amazing.

 Originally Posted by Knivesmillions Yes there is still hope! Yea what he said. The anime industry is like the TV live action series in the US in that respect, the Japanese non game show based live action TV shows, are the biggest abominations ever created by humans, so that lead to anime being the main form of entertainment(outside of gaming ofcourse), so there is a lot being made each year. Hell even in 2009, which is widely considered to be the single worst year in the history of anime, infact it is highly believed in the anime community, that literally not a single good anime came out of that year(it really is that bad of a year). Well until recently, I would agree to all that as well, but then I accidently stumbled onto a anime, that Isn't just good, but is around the masterpiece quality(Kemono no Souja Erin), so while that year may still easily be the worst year in anime history, something worthwhile was still made, a masterpiece at that. The main difference today, and back in the old days, is anime is way too mainstream now, so nearly all, if not all the most popular anime are doomed to suck "or" end up sucking(sigh look how they destroyed Naruto=enough said), so you need to actually put effort into finding the higher quality anime out there. Posting on forums, using Wikipedia, the anime database, ect are the keys to locating quality anime, if you expect to find out about higher end anime, by way of TV commercials, lol good luck with that, because "it will not happen". PS. Where is your avatar from or is it a original char you created?
