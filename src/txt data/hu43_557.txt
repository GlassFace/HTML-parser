 One Piece: Pirate Warriors
 Beat it awhile back and a few thoughts: 1. Gameplay: If you played any of the Dynasty and/or Samurai Warrior games - then you know kind of what to expect. Simple hack and slash 2. Story: It follows the One Piece storyline but they skip a few arcs here and there. For example, they don't go in full detail how they meet Usopp or his intro story arc. It's a shame because it also introduces the Going Merry. 3. Music: Music is great to listen to ...for the first 2-3 minutes but its on a never ending loop. 4. Online: If you tried your hand on the "Another Log" option, it's pretty much that exact gameplay but you have partners who are online with you. 5. Ending: Â Spoiler Hated it. I kind of understand why they did it, but going "Super Saiyan"? (Not exactly, but it might as well have been) Overall: I would give it an Average. I like Dynasty Warrior type games, so I don't mind just "hacking and slashing" my way thru hundreds of enemies at a time. But there were a few things I just did not like and wish they spent more time on it before releasing out to the public.
