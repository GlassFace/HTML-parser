[Anime] Anime And Social Awkwardness
 I honestly think that media like anime just tend to be more accepting of the giant nerds that they know are keeping them afloat, driving them to make content that those nerds are more likely to consume (like the extremely cynical "K-ON", which was manufactured from the ground up to appeal to socially awkward otaku) and doing away with silly modern conventions like coherent stories or complicated characters in favor of unbridled pandering thereby compounding the social awkwardness of admitting to enjoying anime. And in even in cases where something about the anime you like isn't overtly ****ed up there probably is some part of it or its history that is. I've put myself in weird positions where someone will ask why I think "Fate/Zero" is so good and I'll explain it all while completely omitting its origin. When there are aspects of your fandom that are not exactly casual conversation friendly (like Fate's beginnings as a porn visual novel) then you tend to look like a bit of a dork when you try to explain it. I can't imagine what fans of horrifying **** like "Vampire Bund" go through when someone asks them what their favorite anime is.
