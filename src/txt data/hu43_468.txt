[Review] A4's User Video Game Reviews Thread
 So A4, do you want to review your last game? do you want review a game that you played? Or perhaps give recommendations to people who want to buy or rent their next game, or suggest a online game to other people, and recommend what character to use, and whatnot. Perhaps you have the game sooner than other members, and you want to share your opinion about it. Maybe you were invited to Closed Beta, and it'd be good for people to have the insights. Welcome to the A4 User Video Game Reviews Thread. Whether the game is on a console, handheld, PC/MAC, mobile, or a MMO/RPG. or perhaps the system itself. It'd be great if everyone could give their reviews, and it will be good to express your own opinions to others. This thread will allow users (you), to review the games or the console itself. Furthermore, The game does not have to be new, regardless of the date, aslong its a game. Although it is not required for a review, screenshots are highly recommended! Now that being said, the reviews will go as follows: Gameplay, Video, Sound, Concept, Playability, and Playback. Also, how you want to rate is up to you, whether its A to F, 1 to 5, 1 to 10, and so on. Post the reviews on a separate thread so it won't clutter this thread and have it more organized. Okay it's official. The Game Review tag has officially been implemented. Start your review! I will put them into an alphabetic order (#-Z) on here, so that way other members will reference to this thread. Before you start your review, make sure it follows the guidelines. Do not post in this thread. This is for reference only. Go at it! # A Assassin's Creed III B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
