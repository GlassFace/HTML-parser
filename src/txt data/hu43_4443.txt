[Site] Youtube about to hit 10 years on the 14th.
 Well its almost 10 years from the day Youtube was founded on 14th February 2005 (although they opened their doors to uploading from April). So I thought I'd do a "your first memorable experience with youtube" post. My first experience with youtube was back in 8th grade around 2008. My first memorable video was this:  Spoiler These guys were priceless fun back in the day. So post your early memorable experience with youtube.
