Now they're becoming based on man-made items which makes me question what exactly the lore behind the pokemon world is turning into. Well maybe the spoilers are not complete I am hoping. I think I am most disappointed in that there is only one eveelution this gen. Every gen that has one has at least TWO. I was expecting a dragon eveelution. So far we are missing, Normal, Flying, Dragon, Poison, Fighting, Steel, Ground, Ghost, Rock, Bug. Its going to be Generation 20 before we get to see all of them and by than Pokemon will be virtual reality and in addition to having ran out of animals and recycled every single kind of bird and mouse on the planet and ran out of Dinosaurs. But They will have exhausted every ancient and modern weapon, every house hold item and cleaning product and Pokemon will be reduced to food items and hygiene products. Like the Deodorant stick Pokemon. I mean they had to fill their roster with 20 old pokemon with new skins and call it a new pokemon lol. Before we know it. Every 750 that is out right now will have multiple forms lol. ......nah...I think by that point. Gamefreak and Nintendo would end the pokemon franchise at that point.

 Yeah, I don't think I saw any A4ers at the pokemon world championships back in august, pretty sure most people are just playing the game for fun. That's cool that you happen to play it competitively, but you don't need to get all bent out of shape or elitist over people picking mons for their looks. I kinda doubt most people in this thread bother worrying too much over their mons nature, EVs/IVs, etc. because it's just not relevant for the single player game or in multiplayer against friends. That's not to say you aren't allowed to talk about more competitive stuff; for sure you might be able to offer some interesting insight or tips if you're as into the scene as you seem to be implying. I'm sure people would even appreciate some advice if you have any. But brow beating people for enjoying the game "casually" or whatever is just kinda ridiculous, so maybe chill out a little and keep some perspective that it is just a game afterall. On a different note: 

 I guess it does seem like I am angry about it, and I think it is not so much as the people actually making the switch but more of it seems to make my choice that must less special for lack of a better word. So this feeling carries over to other decisions, not just starter choices. I feel like because now you don't like the outcome of your choice, you want to abandon it all together and butt into mine. Ian, is that an actually from the game? Shinies already?

 Those are some pretty insane thoughts to have.

 But there were only three choices and millions of people will be playing the game. Your choice was never all that special to begin with. I mean, your reason for choosing a specific pokemon is certainly unique to you, but yeah in general people are going to be fickle about why they pick what they pick and there's nothing wrong with that. It's just a game. I remember being a little more tribalistic with the original games, over which version/starter I used, same with the rest of my friends and people I knew who played it, but it just doesn't really matter to much why people pick whatever starter they do as long as they're having fun. Yeah, someone got a shiny female starter. Obviously the worst person ever. 

 I wonder how many times they restarted for them...or if they were just that lucky. I now know there is a mega Tyrannitar. Taking a cold shower and then heading to the store.

 I've been playing a bit today. Got myself Braixen which is utterly awesome. He actually uses the stick in his tail for the move animations. Also got myself a Pidgeotto and Flabebe and got Squirtle from the professor dude. Having such a blast playing this. 
 
 Same here Viren. Currently my team is Nimbus Frogadier, Beby the Flabebe, X the Charmeleon, and Polaris the Vivilion. Apparently Vivilion has different colored wings depending on region your DS is set to. Mine has a boring dull color. Like a desert... Oh well, it gets the job done. 
  Spoiler 
 Completely addicted to wonder trade. Powered up some acquaintances met through wonder trading, traded twice with the same dude and got a pokemon I've never heard of or seen before, got my first Eevee of this gen (I WILL get my Eeveelution team come hell or high water), got me a male and female japanese pikachu. Now to find the pokemon daycare... I'm pleasantly surprised by how early you meet many gen 1 pokes, I think that kind of eases the shock of the unknown pokes of the last several gen for myself. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 Anyone who has this game already and has played it a fairly good amount, could you let me know your overall opinion on it so far? I'm literally in the middle about buying this. I want it because it's Pokemon and everything it offers seems epic but I'm not so sure how I'd like the whole 3D aspect of it since I'm so used to playing reg Pokemon on the Gameboy Advanced SP.

The graphics should be the last thing holding you back. The game looks amazing. Go get it now.

 My Froali has already evolved. I got my Charmander and special Torchic and caught a pikachu and my Fletchling has evolved along with 5 other pokemon and I traded with a guy from Finland for my bird and his combee. Anyone know how to request pokemon on trading? I wanna get my hands on a sandshrew as fast as possible.

(Not entirely sure because I have yet to use or even look at the menu) I only traded once, I essentially gave this guy a female combee because he wanted one. I had two so, no skin off my back. I might catch a few scatterbugs, train them into vilivions and trade them over the GTS for other vivilion wing patterns.

 That awkward moment when your Frog dude evolves into a Water/Dark type right when you're about the enter the Fighting gym...

So for everybody's benefit here's some info on trading: WT is the Wonder Trade option, this allows you to pick a pokemon you have and trade it with someone random from across the globe for a random pokemon they want to put up for trade. You can find it under the in game PSS( Player Search System) menu which is accessible on the lower touch screen from the time you turn the game on. It's kind of like a random lottery, you know you're always going to get a poke but you never know what people are going to trade. GTS is the Global Trade System which allows you to search for and trade specific pokemon with anyone across the globe. You can find it under the in game PSS( Player Search System) menu which is accessible on the lower touch screen from the time you turn the game on. In GTS you can search for a pokemon to trade for, or offer a trade. One thing I've noticed is that the "seek pokemon you want" has an alphabetical dropdown list of pokes that you've met, if you 're searching for any pokes you haven't met you have to use the "What Pokemon?" option at the bottom of the seek menu. From there you type the name of the pokemon and it'll run a search, displaying other trainers around the world who match your search, and what pokemon they want in trade. If you have a pokemon that they want in trade it will display the pokedex Icon next to the pokemon they want, indicating that it's possible to complete a trade. Completing any kind of trade with anyone will add them to your PSS "acquaintances" list. From here you can O-power other trainers which give temporary bonuses to other players while they are playing their game. You can level up O-powers by using them more and more. 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them. 
 Super low def picture but still worth uploading. Black Jesus!!!  Spoiler

As per usual my luck sucked and I got a level 4 Metapod in return. Woopdidoo! xD 
 
 I have a level 37 Greninja and fighting a level 28 Mienfoo both are standing off in these awesome fighting poses! Who will win?! Ninja? or the Kung fu Master? lol. Edit Battle results Greninja starts off with a moderate power attack with Water Shuriken and strikes three times Mienfoo responds with a force palm pushing my Greninja back. It recovers quickly and leaps into the air and Mienfoo follows by leaping in the air with another force palm to strike my Greninja while its vulnerable in the air. Greninja unleashes a devastatingly powerful water pulse and hits Mienfoo point blank just as greninja got hit by its force palm and finishes Mienfoo as it crashes it into the ground. I extorted $1,344 out of the battle girl I beat and she don't look too happy about it.

 I just got the bike today not too long ago. I love that thing. It is fast, and it rides smooth. The 8 dimensional grid really makes the thing so much fun to ride. I also added the final two pokemon on my team. A Skiddo named Gogurt, and a Honedge named Omni. So far this game has a lot into it. After several hours of gameplay, I am still not at the second gym. I have a couple annoyances with the game. One, the camera is annoying in lumious City. And the second is some reworked cries for older pokemon. Onix, Volbeat, Illumise, bidoof, farfetch'd just to name a few. Some of them sound like they have static in the background. If they were trying to make the cries sound like noises the pokemon could make, they didn't do it good enough in my opinion. ON another note. I think Swirlix and Spritzee evolve by holding an item, which I think I have collected.

As per usual my luck sucked and I got a level 4 Metapod in return. Woopdidoo! xD The thing to remember with WT is that you can keep trading, so if you get something you're not a fan off you can pass it on. That being said if you turn around and trade pokes like metapod you're just perpetuating the cycle which eventually shits up the whole system. I've evolved the last couple of common pokes I got through WT before trading them again just to shake things up a bit. An interesting note: You cannot trade eggs in WT. Which is kind of a shame, think about how fun it'd be to do a WT, get an egg, and hold on to it wondering what poke was going to pop out. I could see it also being super annoying with people dumping 5billion scatterbug eggs though... Just got a Clauncher named "Artorias" for a Gulpin WT, he's pretty brochill. Considering how quickly WT is available from the start of the game, I'm sure someone could come up with a good challenge where they trade the first couple of pokes they get and then nuzlocke the game.

Wonderlocke 1)You can only catch the first pokemon encountered in each route 2) You must wonder trade it once, the pokemon you receive will now be your party (Starter is excluded) 3)Once the pokemon is defeated it is considered dead, and must be released.
