[Event] [FINALS] A4's Greatest Anti-hero: Free for All
 So now we find ourselves.. towards the end to this tripe little tale of who's an anti-hero, and who's the villain in these parts. No more three way rounds or 1 on 1. All six contenders will be put to task; together. This should make it especially difficult perhaps, seeing as the poll number margins will be a lot lower this time. That is, unless some of the finalists come together and make a strategy and sacrifice a self vote, and voting for another if they think they'll have a better shot at the prize. If you sacrifice your own place in the finals, I'm pretty sure I'll be laughing at you the whole way through. But, it won't be against the newly minted rules to do so. As with the two-way and three-way versions of this contest, the rules remain mostly the same as in those, so I won't be repeating them here. The new rules? 1. To prevent any kind of MsBloody Syndrome seekers out there; to limit the amount of dummy account participation; anyone who's registered within the last two weeks, or 14 days, your vote won't count. So, if you're not reading this and you vote anyway, I simply won't count it. While I believe most won't go the dummy account route, there could be people now outside of the competition who would go that extra, 'too much time on my hands' mile. But if you want to continue soliciting already posting members, go right ahead. I encourage it. This should be as cutthroat as possible. 2. Poll voting will hold less power than it did in the rounds before this one. It's a free for all, and those in it are encouraged to post, talk sh!t, slander, etc. As with the others. Similar to the previous rounds; only in this one, it'll count for so much more. Bonus points will be rewarded to those who take the slandering into real-time in the Chat Box. So this may be an advantage that people like Snap have, but not limited to. So remember, even if you're winning by say, a 5 vote spread, you can still lose to someone who has just a single vote; assuming that person with one vote is in the thread, and in the Chat Box doing their best to diminish the competition. That's what judges will be looking for this time. I know what some are thinking; what about people like soyuza or Krell who won't be posting in here at all more than likely? Judges will view over the last 15-20 posts of contestants like that, and make their own individual ruling on it. So, those two paragraph rulings are the only main addition to things here. But hey, message some of the other contestants and strike a deal that puts on of you ahead in the polls, in an effort to bump someone else out altogether. Nothing against a little sly strategy. Compromise with perhaps, a weaker candidate and work from there. So when all is said and done, don't depend on polls alone to see you through on this. Sailing through this on the poll alone will almost amount to certain defeat. Voting period: 4 days. This should give people proper time to vote AND be @ssholes in this thread. Disclaimer: Again, if you're prone to *****ing, moaning, or crying; simply drop out, tuck your tail between your legs and go home.

 Hell Girl's been nominated for a special categorical automatic win: A4's Vigilante Life Achievement Award. Her achievement? She removed the predator pariah known as Mihstah. A reward well deserved. Take a bow, Hell Girl.. take a bow.

That should give her a wild card entry into this anti-hero competition finals, shouldn't it?
