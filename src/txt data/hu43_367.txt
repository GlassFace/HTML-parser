 This game sounds really cool, i never played the first game, maybe i just overlooked it or was to busy. But the cyberpunk feel yet fantasy mmo-feel is making it really interesting, plus i'm liking the matrix moves.

 Haha Welcome to GunZ online the game where you get eaten alive if you have no skill To give you an idea of how the original gunZ looks like  Spoiler Yep you got it right everyone uses shotguns, machine guys are for noobs thats why this game requires skill in one dash you basically need to press 5 buttons, this vid was made by a friend of mine we were in the same clan and used to play alot he still plays for funzies I quit a long time ago we were both equally skilled.

 GunZ is quite possibly the most unbelievably broken game in existence and has one of the dumbest fanbases I've ever seen. This is a game where, if you don't practice complicated 3-6 key combos, sometimes for hours on end, your chances of staying competitive are slim if you're not innovative. There are 10 types of weapons you can choose to play with. For the most part, you're going to see a grand total of two of those: the katana and the shotgun. The reason for this is because of "K-Style," which involves special techniques that exploit a glitch in the character animations. This lets players do all sorts of admittedly neat stuff, such as move impossibly fast, climb walls and, gamebreakingly, shoot shotguns twice as fast as possible while ignoring reload. Honestly, for a good and rather brief description, go here. However, be careful as TV Tropes can suck your life away. However, this would be OK if it weren't for one little thing: The fanbase. Dear god, the fanbase. I am not exaggerating when I saw that I have never seen a fanbase as downright stupid as the GunZ fanbase. If you don't use K-Style, you're a noob, despite the fact that not everyone has time to just sit and practice. If you use any weapon they don't like, you're a noob, even if you use rifles or semi-auto pistols, which are the most accurate weapons in the game and require a lot of skillful aiming. If you have better armor than them, you're a noob, even if they're too low of a level to use the armor you have. If you DO use K-Style, you're using it cheaply and are therefor a noob. This is a fanbase that debates the legitimacy of cheating in Quest, the game's co-op mode and the fanbase that can't comprehend the fact that K-Style was caused by glitches and CAN'T be brought over to GunZ 2, at least not in the form it took in GunZ 1, due to the new graphics engine. Honestly, I challenge you to find a game with a dumber fanbase. That said, GunZ is a rather fun game despite its flaws and I would probably have not quit if it weren't for the unbearably dumb fanbase that only saw me as a "sprayer noob" due to the fact that I chose not to give myself carpal tunnel before the age of 25 and instead focused on strategic long ranged fighting.

 That's just epicness. I'm not pro yet at Gunz, but I have two friends who are both teaching me who just kill the competition when it comes to pros! XD One's a master at quests and knows all the little tricks there is to know. The other is a god at pvp and actually beta-tested the game and still plays. Apparently he does a forbidden step without putting any effort into it at all! Of course I'm still a trainee, but I can wait for this release!^^ 
 OMG Gunz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I play Gunz like a year ago when my friend showed it to me. I played it for long hours and it easily became one my favourite games. I used to be quite good at this game. Oh my God, I can't believe this. This is just pure epicness. Thank you Takera. I love you.

You're really going to try and defend a fanbase that shouts "noob!!!!11" every time you beat them, regardless of how you beat them? How about the fact that they DEBATE THE LEGITIMACY OF CHEATING.

How about the fact that they DEBATE THE LEGITIMACY OF CHEATING. Lol every game community is like that I can post screenshots here of League of Legends where people say ****ing retard when you kill them, about that, you cant put the blame on the fanbase here the game designers shouldnt have allowed cheating in the first place they should have updated their game guard every week like most of the games, I know that people cheat in Quest modes but when you get higher level around 30 there are no hackers or cheater and almost no one calls you noobs when you kill them.

Just about every game has its share of idiots. GunZ, however, takes it to an extreme. People will boot you out of games for not playing how they think you should, they will ***** and moan over something as simple as dying, in team games they will claim that you would suck 1 on 1, ignoring that team dynamics are much different than 1 on 1 and they will accuse you of hacking if they can't beat you. Its hard to explain how much worse GunZ is than other games, but GunZ is the only game where this isn't a minority. Again, this is a fanbase that doesn't even agree on how fair it is to cheat. 

 I am currently in Closed Beta 3 trying it out. Man I have to say, they removed a lot of the skillcap and it looks super nice. Campaign ( story mode) is extremely challenging. though if you want to run the game somewhat nice you need a good graphic card, bueh.

 @Cloud, When someone starts flying accross the map with a super fast butterfly... I think they are hacking... @Takera, I thought they were removing K-style and the game was supposed to come out AGES ago wasn't it? I've given up on waiting, so I just play Warframe now >.> Also if it requires good GPU, count me out.
