 World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor
 Warlords of Draenor is right around the corner! While Cataclysm was a huge disappointment, I think Mists of Pandaria was an overall good game despite the initial small splash that it made. Lore explanation: In Mists of Pandaria, Garrosh Hellscream tried to reform the Horde as a more dominant force in the world, and in this time committed many atrocities not only to the Alliance, but the neutral Pandaren and Horde who did not support him as well. He was the final boss of the expansion, and after he was defeated he was imprisoned waiting to stand trial in Pandaria. In Warlords of Draenor, he will escape and use the Caverns of Time to travel back to the day that his father, Grommash Hellscream, was killed destroying Mannoroth. In the cinematic, you can see him saving Grommash's life (who originally died in that battle). Gameplay changes: 1.) Stat squish! Crits were getting slightly ridiculous in Mists of Pandaria so they've brought back Vanilla numbers. 2.) Redesigning of all classes and the removal of unnecessary abilities. 3.) Unfortunately no new races/classes. 4.) Garrisons unlocked. You can now create your own small village. 5.) Huge graphics updates on older races. They're all looking good. Anybody else thinking about joining up for this expansion? WoW is still very alive with 7 million subscribers, and the number is looking to climb up to 9 or 10 at the start of Warlords of Draenor.
