 Should I skip Naruto fillers?
 Hello there. So I just started watching Naruto Shippuuden. Watching the original Naruto, I noticed most of the fillers were extremely bad. And I've heard Shippuuden has got many fillers. So my question is, are the fillers just as bad as the fillers in the original Naruto? Should I just skip them? Thank you in advance, Yum the Kinky Priest.
