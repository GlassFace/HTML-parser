 Help Identifying Anime
 By this I remembered there was an anime I also watched and couldn't remember it's name although a certain line came in its opening song 'we will always be there for you' and it was mecha anime and a certain golden haired girl was waiting for the main hero to rescue her or protect her etc... so anyone know which anime?
