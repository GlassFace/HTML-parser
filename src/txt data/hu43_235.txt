 Lifting Veils: The Return [READ FIRST POST]
 A new LV thread for a new year. Y'all should know the rules from the old one, but they still are as follows: Lifting Veils is the official "posting pictures of yourself" thread. - Appropriate images only. No nudity, no obscenity, make images SFW, etc. - No fake images. - No repeats. Don't repost an image you posted before just so you can comment on someone else's. - Only post images that include yourself, but pets are fine too. No rooms or random inanimate objects unless you've also included an actual picture of yourself. Also, if you're posting a pic of yourself, actually post a pic of yourself! If you post a pic wherein you have pretty much completely hidden your face from visibility, just don't bother posting! - No chatting: all posts must contain a picture of you. NO EXCEPTIONS.. - No creepy comments. And if you comment someones picture, please do not quote the image directly. Put it in spoiler tags. - Put all pictures in spoiler tags unless you're posting only one and it's not very large. - Abide by all other forum rules, too, please. And to make this post abide by official LV rules, here's me looking really lame: Â Spoiler
