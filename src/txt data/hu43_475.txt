 Favorite Disney Movie?
 So many good ones, which do you like the most? How come? I'm a big fan of Up and Aladdin. I really enjoy Disney and these two movies really stick out for some reason. Up is a lot newer, but I think it's definitely one of the better Pixar/Disney movies that has recently came out. Makes me a little teary when I watch it haha. Aladdin I just never get sick of. Probably have so much of it memorized by now.
