 Vegeta vs Hulk!

Ill go with Mahjin Vegeta for the win on this one then, for remember when cell was so strong his power up would shake the planet? Also vegetas final flash could deform if not destroy the planet? Plus the fact that piccolo when he was weaker 1,200 power destroyed the moon? Well if the hulk was strong enough to destroy a asteroid then vegeta was that strong in his normal form easily. So he could very easily dispose of the hulk in this form
