[Personal Life Discussions] Is it bad to be shy?
 So, I'm really shy, I've always been really bad at talking with people and making conversations not feel awkward. And for most of my life, I feel like I've been taught being shy is bad; so it always kind of felt like being myself was just being bad, and that always makes me feel uncomfortable. Do you think it's bad to be shy? Sure, I know it comes with its perks and its problems, like most things do, but tell me whether you think it's just plain bad or not. Because for me, I've always gotten the impression that it's a bad thing. 
 The rivals just got a lot sexier.
