 Pokemon Alpha Sapphire & Omega Ruby Thread
 I haven't seen one, and well I fancy starting one up . I bought both in limited edition version, on the day of release and I haven't played Omega Ruby but am on my 4th Badge on Sapphire. I don't get much time to play, so play when I can. My Team Kirlia LV 26 Mightyena Lv 24 Golbat Lv 28 Marshstomp LV 26 Metang LV 25
