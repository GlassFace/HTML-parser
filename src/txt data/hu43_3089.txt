 Is my Xbox One overheating???
 When im playing tomb raider its stuttering a lot. Its a download not a disc so its not a scratch. It just started happening the other day when it got cooler And the heat has been on more. Here's a pick - not enough ventilation?? (,yeah terrible lighting no flash on my tablet) Â Spoiler I have a two year warranty so its not a problem that way. All saves are backed up on xbox live right? I would just have to reinstall the games right? Should I try an external fan to cool it??
