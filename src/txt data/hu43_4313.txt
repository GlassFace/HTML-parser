 1st Playthrough + No Walkthrough Do other players do this often?
 I put like 3000+ hours into skyrim on my first playthrough. Who needs a walkthrough on a game thats as open as this? Everything points you to the right way in this game as well. Its not hard at all. Walkthroughs just strip away the mystery of games, makes it feel like you completed that game ONLY because you had assistance from somebody else. Dont you want to feel the glory of single handedly. If you cant beat a game alone, then how are you a gamer? You're more like a backseated gamer. Having help the whole way.
