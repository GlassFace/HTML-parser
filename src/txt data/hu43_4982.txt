 What are the best Slice Of Life/Romance?
 Drama/slice of life/romance-Clannad (I've still got this on my to watch list, but it's really popular in the genre you're looking for) comedy/slice of life/romance-Toradora ecchi comedy/slice of life/romance-B gata H kei(also has a good English dub called Yamada's first time and is rather funny) and it's more of adventure/romance than slice of life but I'd recommend spice and wolf
