Animation is handled by Production I.G, Xebec, and OLM, Inc., and the special is split into four parts, each directed by a different director from these studios. It was broadcast on TV Tokyo on October 2, 2013, ten days before the release of the X and Y video games, and will be streamed internationally on Nintendo's Pokémon TV service from November 15, 2013.
