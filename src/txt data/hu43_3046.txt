 My Top 5 Recomendations
 Oh maybe 1. The World God Only Knows 2. Chobits 3. Squid Girl 4. Hikaru No Go 5. Full Moon Wo Shagashita these are the best animes from just the top of my head, there are many others though. Also add Ah! My Goddess and Ginban Kaleidoscope, those are excellant series, as well as Toradora.
