 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 My vote is for Kyla ! Deal with it .

Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Voted for Kayla because Pinky has a save animals link in her signature, that ain't no villian. Also Elfa just seems horny more than evil from what I can tell 
 Best Anime!!

 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses. Beside you as you like softly down, I will be until I hear the words "Checkmate". ~Sebastian Michaelis ~ Individual 4 ~ A4's Greatest Villain <Right Here Lmao

 Wait... there's actual fear of J4smin4 going around? I challenge her to an open duel then. And if she declines... I'll attack her Naruto love and the fact that Sasuke sucks. Yep, I said it. Now accept my challenge.
