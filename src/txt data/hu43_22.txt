 Gunna Show Sum Love for the Westboro Baptist Church
 So their fun-loving crew will be paying my neighborhood a visit tomorrow. Although it's at 8:30am (ugh), in front of a Jewish Community Center, I think I might just pay a visit to see what kind of hilarity and trouble ensues. Pictures may be taken. Should I stay or should I go? 
"The cosmos is full, beyond measure, of elegant truths of the exquisite interrelationships and awesome machinery of nature." C.Sagan "The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it, but the way those atoms are put together!" C.Sagan "I could feel my being turned, as in a wheel whose motion nothing jars, by the Love that moves the Sun and the other Stars." Dante Alighieri Back for a short while, feel free to say hello!
