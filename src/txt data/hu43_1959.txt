 A4 Broadcast - Nov 17
 I haven't really seen much of anyone talking about the podcast after it was shelved, at least outside of these specific threads. Does regular members of the community even care enough to offer assistance with this? If so, I'd imagine someone other than staff would have already tried to discuss this with the rest of the community. I personally liked it, but I obviously can't speak for other users on these forums.
