 Played Victor for the first time yesterday. Would have posted a screen shot but my game was acting up last night. I think I found my second Mid Champ to work with. I love dat damn Lazer. Great farm and poke with a pretty decent range as well. What is his build order though? I went with the standard Recommended build the game overs and did pretty good, but I know I could have done way better if I knew what to rush and how to proceed from there. 7-4-6 was end game score for me, and I wasnt even playing mid. Dumbass Xerath Instalocked and called mid like centuries after I called it.

 @BlackTemplar That's a pretty funny bug. Good find! @DUNN The way you build is always up to you. Standard AP Builds normally work just fine honestly. As a first item, I always decide whether I can survive with an Athene's or an Archangel's. If I can do Archangel's, I'd go that route, followed by a Deathcap and Liandry's. If you're doing really well, you can get more AP, if you need more Cooldown, get an Athene's in place of an Archangel's. If they're building a ton of Magic Resist, get a Void Staff. If they have a ton of HP and you can't blast them down fast enough, get a Deathfire Grasp in place of a Deathcap. Just, overall, common sense buys.

Yep, it's annoying when your lane opponent panics and says "This guys is two leagues above me please camp my lane jungle." Can't even play b4ll5 d33p champions anymore because I know the second I go in the jungler is gonna come out of the bush.

 I haven't played much league lately, I love watching the likes of OGN & LCS but I never actually play the game itself for long enough periods to even get ranked xD 

 I'm pretty sure veigar has the most single target burst in the entire game. his q and w alone can kill a squishy not even taking into account dfg and his ult. 
 LeBlanc, Nasus, Akali and Sion all can do strong single target bursts. Nasus has a more consistent and more efficient single target in that he can be tanky and still knock someone for a loop with his Q. Sion is about the same. LeBlanc and Akali are also much more reliable than Veigar as they can escape, but like Veigar, they can be hard countered by an on-target stun such as Taric and Sion. Akali is even worst in that she can get countered a Pink Ward alone.

 Shian you need to duo ranked with me. 
We are just 'one' within the 'all.' But only when those 'ones' gather together can 'all' exist. - Edward Elric. 
 veigar has his massive stun though. 
 @Ixi You don't want to queue with a Silver I D: @Zer0 Like I said, Veigar is a situational champion. The fact that he is a single target assassin with only one AoE skill that is largely unreliable, he isn't as sought after like Orianna, Gragas, Viktor and other AP Champions. As said as well, his stun is good, but it's short. Unless your team can make use of it by assassinating all targets within it, it's useless. Would you be able to kill all high priority targets before that stun is gone? Because Veigar is useless once he uses his kit. You have to wait at least 5-6 seconds for it to reset and that's a long time in a team fight. If the other team have high burst champions, sure, you make have removed their fighting capabilities, but what happens if you can't get close because you could stun only their tanks? It would mean very little in the grand scheme of things.

 So, I've been working real hard to improve my presence in each game I've played lately and it seems to be working out really well. Once you begin roaming and getting kills (or assisting others in getting kills) it really demoralizes teams (at least at my level) and very often my opponents will collapse in on themselves and decide it's all over before the game gets too far along. I think at silver level securing an early game lead and allowing the opposing team to explode into infighting and arguing is the way to go.

 @KT That's definitely a great idea. Generally speaking, that's what I normally try to do as a support and it's one of the biggest reasons why I prefer playing Sona, because she has the kit to do damage, the ability to stop big plays from occurring and also have the ability to create big plays. It's also why I have Janna in my back pocket, but don't generally use her because she doesn't have the damage. When you put yourself in a position where you're going to put more presence in the game, be aware that you will have to do that for the rest of the game which is actually harder to do if you're in any other role but support. It means you will have to expand your map awareness beyond those wards on the map and theoretically predict what the other team is going to do and still keep up with objective control and farm. You also have to keep in mind your team composition and openly think about active targets you should aim for as well as being a lot more open to communication and attempt to diffuse issues as fast as possible if they occur. If your team composition can't win at the late game, end the game quickly. If the other team is demoralized, there's still a good chance that if they have a Vayne or a Tryndamere, they'll beat you on Champion power alone. While not everyone is terrible at the game and obviously, most players know who to focus and what to go for, something that will happen a lot is you'll end up failing to identify proper threats. For example... if you're going against a Nasus + Vayne combo, obviously, the choice to beat is Vayne, correct? But how do you stop Nasus from using his Ult, charging through and dropping his CC on your DPS and then two-shotting them? Simply put, you can't. No amount of presence will stop a Champion like that, especially when you have a Vayne that can clean up and visa versa... a Nasus who can clean up... and that's just identifying two champions. Generally speaking, since I main Support, my only real option to stop that is to convert my resources into getting a Zeke's Herald, Mikael's Crucible or a Frozen Heart and refocus my efforts in pressuring Baron control so when they attempt it, we can pick off targets and end the game after a forced engage, if possible. If you were placed in that situation, what would you do? More likely than not, in-fighting can cause a game to end simply because the team can't pull back together, but this is just an example of what happens if Champion strength over powers that.

 I best role is support tbh, I mean I'm not brilliant at it but I can tend to win games in that role more then I do when I'm Mid, top or ADC, Normally if I'm ADC or Jungle (Which I never usually am) it means we've lost because I can't really play them roles to save my life ^^; Top I'm alright at, I've been working with Aatrox right now, I haven't played league in a good month or so probably now. But if any of you are interested in playing with me My NA username is: Hyunshi (I'm not really that high of a level on it considering I mainly play EUW) & for those in Europe it's: Raemus 

 Shian, I'm Gold V. For all intents and purposes, I am still in Silver I.

 @Ixi Feel free to add me: Shian Kiri With Final Fantasy XIV going live soon, don't know how much time I'll be spending on LoL, but I'll definitely be on playing when I can. -- Started giving Lucian a go... Instead of building him as an auto attacker, I build him like Blue Ez. I would've gone with a Trinity Force since overall, that would've augmented his kit, but with the removal of Icy, the overlap with the movement speed buff off of his W and the new Trinity Force didn't sit well for me. So I opted for burst damage trades with auto attack follow ups on his down time. Manamune, Ice Gauntlet, Berserker Grieves, Infinity Edge, Phantom Dancer/Blade of the Ruin King, Last Whisper Ultimately, his play is very hit and run, which is what hes kind of about in the first place. You hit with your W, your chase where possible. With Ice Gauntlet, you can permanently chase if need be and duel where possible. Infinity Edge to give him more of a kick, Phantom Dancer to increase his auto attack potential as well as boosting his Ult or Blade of the Ruin King for targets with a lot of HP and still boost your Ult... and Last Whisper because it shreds every one. If you want to go the auto attacker route, you can use the same normal builds for everyone else but you can use the new Frozen Mallet since now it has a bit more attack damage and it combos really well with his W, giving him endless chase potential. The one thing I will say about Lucian though is he doesn't play that well as an auto attacker since his attack speed is extremely low. He is a champion meant for burst dueling and you'll get more bang doing so and the fact that he can chase will really put your discipline to the test.

 ez adc is pretty decent though. it's all situational. for example if i have a generally poke heavy team like lux and nid i usually go blue build (pretty much the build you mentioned above). but if there is no need for poke then i usually go adc build ie ez and can probably carry harder that way. blue build is really fun though so it weighs a lot on why i pick it so often. but then again just add an ice gauntlet on your adc build and it pretty much becomes a blue build that's even stronger because you have more late game damage potential. 
 BEST VIDEO EVER! Lee sin plays are always fun to watch :3 Shame my jungle lee sins always go full retard.

 Zer0, any champion in the game can be good as an Auto Attacker. Ez isn't an auto attacker by nature, the majority of his power comes from spamming his kit, which is kind of the point. He's not a true auto attacker like Vayne, Ashe and Caitlyn. In that sense, Corki, Lucian and Ez are in the same category in that they're skill based ADC's and are 100% fully utilized as such. It's why you're supposed to build a Sheen on them and it's why they have dashes that force them to go "all-in" or to "disengage". They're not the kinds of Champions you're supposed to sit there and auto attack with, they're the kind of Champions that do burst ADC Damage and Auto Attack while waiting for resets as well as for kiting. If a bruiser jumps on a Corki, Lucian or Ez, they can take them down while Ashe and Caitlyn can't really do that. Just remember, the kit is just as important as the items you get. Any champion in the game can be built as any role, but you build to maximize their kit.
