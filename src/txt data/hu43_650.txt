 Teen Wolf the TV series.
 Ok I watching this religiously when it was on tv. It was on MUCH music in Canada I do not know what channel it would be on anywhere else in the world. Anyway, my questions goes out to the people that watched season 2. Around the end of Season 2 Derek and his uncle (who's name escapes me right now(he is also an ALPHA)) are trying to figure out what the Kenima(sp?) evolves into after it's larva state. Apparently it was suppose to gain wings. They Derek's uncle was doing the searching and they got a video, they clicked the link and immediately close the computer. My question is does anyone have any idea as to what they might have seen? Im not expecting much but I just would like to see what other people think or might say. Totalchaos
