 Valentine's Day Events
 A couple of people approached me in the past week regarding the hosting of Valentine's Day Events. If anyone else wants to create one, by all means go ahead and create them in the events' subforum. Don't worry about how many threads are in there right now. I will sticky your threads that have nothing to do with the A4 awards so that they all get fair views. (There are 10 or so more A4 Awards polls to go up. I will do those tomorrow if the other volunteer isn't able to get it done) 
 Do you RP, or are you interested in learning? Join our Role Player's Society here on A4. Would you like a baseball bat to shove up your ass along with that stick? You're a mod, please act like one A4 is on FACEBOOK
