[Slice of Life] FREE!- Iwatobi Swim Club (aka Swimming Anime, aka Tumblr's baby) - Page 2
 Man service or not this anime is great so far. I enjoy it for what it is and how its slowly becoming heart wrenching. People thought it was going to be a happy go lucky anime but nope Haruka and Rin plot thickens and explains a lot. Friendships go deep yo~ Anyways the anime is pretty good so far and folk fought hard for it and I feel entitled to finish it for better or worse. 
 Beat it raw  Spoiler 
 This past episode as really great, and I like how it's not so straight forward. We find out that Haru quit swimming because he hurt Rin, and it's safe t o assume that Rin got mad at Haru (when they raced again when they were older) because either 1.) He felt like Haru Let him win, (Because c'mon when Haru was like "that's great, you won" he didn't really seem "Affected" for a lack of a better term. And wHat mo said, this is a Hard work vs natural type of conflict, so rin- who has to work hard to be good, probably felt like Haru went easy on him. but at this point, we know that Haru's character, he doesn't care about winning anyway, nor does he care about losing so 2.) that could of Mad Rin just as mad, that Haru doesn't care about swimming in that sense, and yet he(Rin) cares about it a lot. They both love swimming, but they have different views on it. This episode was pretty funny, and a lot got done, the swimming club came to be, we get some past history as to what happened between Rin and Haru, and it was also a set up to the main introduction to the new member next episode. I also like how their are a few twists to this show. The whole Art club making their posters sequence was hilarious And Gou, I'm am so happy, She is NOT Annoying. And she's hilarious  Spoiler 

 Danny summed everything up perfectly. Well done, sir! I liked the art club moment too xD can't wait for the next one! 

 Is that art scene in episode 2? I don't remmeber seeing it.

 yeah, but it was very brief. basically just the gifs worth. 

 Honestly, I don't even know why I love this show so much. I'm lookin' at it and thinking, why am I even into a show about a bunch of guys in a swimming pool? I don't even know. Gou-chan....KOU, is definitely something of a comic relief, but also, she seems to be an important character as well. I'm looking forward to the next episode. Although, I found it strange how the pool was in the condition it was in. In America maybe, but Japan? I was thinking they'd keep care of their school much more than that.

 So this is where all the half naked men cosplays came from at anime expo 2013 :S

 I agree with you shinikami, Gou seems very important. And I can honestly say I really, really enjoy Makoto's character, he's a really good friend. 

 Bumpnig, cause I can. Seems there was a delay with this past episode because of the airing schedule on Weds. But I thought this episode was good, in a sense we see theres a deeper story behind Makoto. Something happened to him when they were kids at the ocean. Based on the sequences I'm guessing those men passing were all apart of a funeral. Perhaps someone close to him drowned in the ocean, and this whole thing with Rei is gonna cuasse some traumatic flashbacks? Oh and speaking of Rei, if he's so smart and he's stuided about long distancd swimming in the Ocean, HOW THE HELL DO YOU NOT KNOW TO NOT SWIM IN THE OCEAN AT NIGHT. Like, he's books smart an all, but he aint very street smart, or in this case, Beach smart. 

 ^ Besides tide, night and day doesn't matter much. Point is the guy can't swim...no idea why, it's very easy to swim. Anyway good episode, I'm still only watching for Gou.

 This is one of the best series to come along in a while. Obviously it is not deep in any way, but is fun, has good looking guys, and just leaves you feeling good inside. Think I have a crush on Nagisa It kind of reminds me of ookiku furikabutte a bit actually, guy centered, same age range, focusing on a sports club, training and trying to be their best, etc ... maybe why I like both so much.

 So I love this anime. This is one of the anime that I'm excited about for the new release. The art is awesome, the characters are cool and the plot is good. Plus I love the OSTs. This is the first time I encounter an anime focusing of swimming and I didn't expect to love it. I agree with the others. It's kinda feel gay but isn't suppose to be like that? I actually saw this in a yaoi website. Oh well, gay or just fan service, it's fun to watch and will continue to support it. Haru-chan is my favorite. Haru x Rin OTP. Huehue Oh Gou-chan is cute. 
 Ok, am I the only one who felt that makoto's problem with the ocean was a bit anticlimactic? I mean, I understand the old man probably was a big part of his childhood, but I guess how it was done, I wasn't very emotionally moved. But I did like how Haru was pretty protective of him, when it came to exepressing his feelings, and sharing the info with everyone. Haha and Nagisa is always funny. I think this episode was needed, it brought them closer together in terms as a group I feel. 

 Just watched the 12th and final episode via crunchyroll. It was so good and culminated so well. I loved this series. And to top it off the words "See you next summer" were in the final still shot ... I can only hope that means they are making a 2nd season to debut again next summer! AWESOME!

I know I was not the target demographic at all, dudes in tight swim trunks is not my top of list title, But I found it entertaining, and the last episode pulled it all together. For a title built on a 30 second promo made, I was amazed it had a story at all. Rei was quite the stand up guy for  Spoiler not swimming in the last relay and allowing the gang to be a team once again. the animation in the last swimming sequence was top notch. The soundtrack worked and was good at the end (Man I am going to miss that end title) Now was the show perfect? Not at all. It suffered from about a half dozen tropes, and although the animation was devine the character designs were fairly bland. Rin being a bit of an exception, although he did have the razor tooth. (why do manic misunderstood antagonists who later are  Spoiler good drawn with a saw blade for a rack of teeth? Viral in TTGL I can understand. Anyhow, overall I dug the show. 7 out of 10 for moe. 
 
 Rei was the best character in my opinion. But he wasnt my favorite character if that makes sense. He had to go through the whole "Well what about Rin" thing throughout the show and he put up with it. I'm glad he took action and yeah in the last episode I was okay with what Rei did...because it leaves it open for season 2...See you next Summer time.
