 Vegeta vs Hulk!
 Originally Posted by FairyTailFreak I honestly don't think it would be remotely close. Vegeta could have destroyed a planet by the very beginning of Dragon ball Z series with the power that he had. That's not even mentioning how powerful he becomes by the end of the series. And no I'm not counting GT. I could be wrong but I don't think Hulk ever possessed that kind of power. I don't know that much background on Hulk though. I've only seen the movies. Still, it's not even a fight in my mind. Hulk has. As I posted before, Hulk's footsteps have done more damage than Vegeta ever has. Vegeta only ever claims he's capable of destroying Earth. If he couldn't destroy a planet by recklessly blowing himself up in his most powerful form, he absolutely wasn't capable of doing it early on when he was at his weakest. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
