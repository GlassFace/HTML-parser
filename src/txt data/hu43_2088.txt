 What are conventions like?
 I went to a game covetion in Milan... I didn't like that... few cosplayers, no interesting vendors (for me, but there were good games on sale) and some famous Italian youtuber, but I don't follow them so I had no interest... That was my first time, maybe comic convention are better. However if you come in Italy there are too much other beautiful things to visit!
