 [School Days] Opinion? - Page 2
 What do you guys think about school days? I thought it was really good, crazy ending. I can see why a lot of people dont like Makoto, but I liked him for some reason. Also alot of people didnt like the ending but I loved it! Compared to the first few episodes I never thought it would end like that. Anyways what do you guys think?
