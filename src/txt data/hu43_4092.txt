[General Discussion] How do you drink your water? Tap, Bottled, Filtered? Why?
 Saw a video recently of a guy buying bottled water and it got me thinking, how do you have your water? I know in some places in the world, tap water can make you ill and give you things like diarrhea. In England tap water is perfectly fine to drink (as far as I know). I know some peolpe filter it and some boil it then cool it down in the fridge.. Personally I just stick to tap water. Less Hassle and taste fine . I drink around 5-6 litres a day at the moment. I don't drink anything else either, no milk, no juice, no pop etc.. Just water (Except for the occasional Chocolate milk or Apple Juice ) But yeah - How do you drink your water and why>
