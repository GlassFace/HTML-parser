 Princess Mononoke
 I just watched this movie this Saturday, I checked out the dvd from the library, let's see Billy Bob Thorton was the really ugly guy's voice wasn't he, and Claire Danes was Mononoke, who was raised by talking wolves, then there was the really weird looking forest spirit. It was a long movie, over two hours, but didn't get too boring, I liked it, but didn't really love it, it is one of the classic movies of anime though, and is worth watching. Disney, I think, is responsible for the englis dub, which is rare to see popular Hollywood stars lend their voices to an anime isn't it, so Disney must have thought highly of this movie.
