 Have you ever had the sad disorder?

Not to mention what a twelve hour flight from Michigan USA? That would be tough..... But it would be a blast Than I'd swing by New Zealand too and take a lord of the rings tour @jugger - is ayers rock still controversial with your native population and tourists? But it would be nice to have the sun and the warmth at least for a little while
