 Here I go: robotech  Spoiler dusk maiden of amnesia  Spoiler black bullet  Spoiler tales of vesperia  Spoiler sword art online  Spoiler honorable meniton - strike witches  Spoiler strike witches soundtrack http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6A17D3D4EFC3DE11 Robotech has to be number 1 all time for me. I just love the fanfare Also the animation for the opening of dusk maiden of amnesia is just splendid. I threw in a sixth - strike witches. The opening is good but the overall soundtrack is awesome. Great military style orchestral score Enjoy.. Edit - the tales of vesperia clip is from the video game. But the whole Tales of series has great intros.....

Sent from my Nexus 7 using Tapatalk already watched no game no life lol it was a great anime and kampfer to be honest i didn't like it to much because it kinda annoys me of how the main character which is a boy, can change into a girl and everyone else is just a girl lol xD

 Honestly the first season is the weakest it doesn't really pick up untill mid season. So I'd highly recommend giving it another shot

 I don't have a specific top 5, but I will say this: the openings for Nagi-Asu are AMAZING. The point of an opening is to get you in the mood for an anime, to watch that specific show. And you know what? It does. The first opening starts up all upbeat, happy, shows you the beautiful, underwater world that our characters (some of them) hail from. And, most importantly, the colors are bright, shining, and at the same time, genuine. (Not cartoony or wacky.) But then the second opening- quieter. Less volume, less instruments. A softer voice. Darker colorings, the characters seem uncertain and wary. Hell, halfway through the opening, there's a shot that could have been in the first opening (save the music) with four characters in a brightly lit schoolroom. This shot suddenly gives way as the schoolroom now contains two characters in different, darker uniforms, shadows lengthening across the room, and their faces downcast and melancholy. The tempo gradually ups, but it seems less triumphant and exuberant as desperate and relieved. Those openings, as part of one single anime, seem to be the best I've ever seen. Openings shouldn't be judged only on musical enjoyment or visual enjoyment, but on the tone they set and what they accomplish. And those two, in concert, were the best for a single anime I've EVER seen.

 I can't make a list like that cuz there are so many ones I love that it would be a waste to make a list cuz all of em are good. 
~Twigggg~ My blog : http://metrostudios.tumblr.com/ 
 1. Naruto OP 5  Spoiler 2. Gantz  Spoiler 3. Higurashi No Naku Koro ni  Spoiler 4. Elfen Lied  Spoiler 5. Monster  Spoiler 
 ^ That Monster opening was really something. Though, I think the closing theme "For The Love Of Life" was much better.

 I only have 4 4: Spice and Wolf 1 3: Spice and Wolf 2 2: Black Butler 1: Full Metal Alchemist Original 
 Am I seriously only allowed to list 5? This is going to be tough. Sorted descendingly: 5. Ookiku Furikabutte 2nd Opening (Seishun Line). Gotta squeeze this one in the list. The song is much better than the first one. It fits into the scenes so nicely. Too bad the anime ended much sooner than expected.  Spoiler 4. Cardcaptor Sakura 1st Opening (Catch You Catch Me). My favourite one out of all 3. Hard to believe this ends up 4th on the list, considering how obsessed I am with the song. It is very cute and upbeat. Sakura's costume also looks best here compared to the other 2.  Spoiler 3. Inuyasha 1st Opening (Change The World). It was difficult to decide between this and the second opening. But the former gives me more chills than the latter.  Spoiler 2. Digimon Adventure 01 (Butter-Fly). I remember when I first saw Takeru's Angemon shown at the end of this opening, I went completely ballistic lol. His digi-volution was my most anticipated one.  Spoiler 1. Hunter X Hunter 1st Opening (Ohayou). That song man. Argh brings back so many memories! Even if the clips are only of the gang waking up and washing their faces, they give me goosebumps. Killua's friendly glance is just so... huah. I should stop.  Spoiler There are still more that I wanna list (Hell Teacher Nube, Flame of Recca, Blood + 1st opening). Just gonna have to settle with those 5. Just realised that most of my choices are old school anime. I feel old. *sickly coughs*

 I have an embarrassing amount of OPs on my iPhone. My friends and my sisters make fun of them constantly. At least my 6 year old almost-cousin loves to listen to them when I drive with her.
