[General Discussion] A4's Opinion of You? - Page 2

I'm like the most loved/envied human being, kinda like the new Michael Jordan. At least thats what I think.

 i dont know what people think of me and i dont care. sure i dont want to be A4's most hate but as long as i dont get any hate mail i dont care. im sure most of the population of this sight think of me as just another soul on this sight, i probably got a person or 2 that hates me and atleast a few that like me. my cousins on here and i know he dont hate me so whats the point of trying to be A4's allstar.

 Are you a nerd? 
 I'm fairly certain that, whatever reputation I have, it's not very good. However, I try to be fairly welcoming to the new people in the community. When I first joined, I was probably your classic clueless newbie. I was 13, though. Didn't know how not to act like a complete child. It didn't help that I spent most of my time in FnG with Ely and the rest of that huge spammer group. I thought it was so cool to be 'lolz a huge tr0ll' like all of them, so I spammed. A lot. From there, I think I've gained a fairly better reputation. I still make bad posts, but I'm working on that. Not to mention that, as I grow older, my experiences/perspective help me to expand my horizons and develop better opinions and all that junk. (Oh, and I'm so hot. I was Miss A4, guys. I was. Am I - hah - am I the only one who - guys? Guys, c'mon. Miss A4. Me.)

 I'm probably second to only Strugz as the most overrated member. Being liked or hated isn't that hard. Unlike me when I read my own posts. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 You either know me, or you don't. Based on that you either see me as a complete *******, who's sole existence is to piss all over this board, or as a reasonable individual who enjoys socializing and sharing knowledge but is still an *******. Grab me on skype, I guarantee you'll learn more about me in 5 minutes there than from reading my entire posting history :3 
They don't have to burn the books, they just remove them.

I know myself that I am a very welcoming and kind person who wants to help as much as possible. I try to make it a point to be the odd one and help out the newer members and be as kind to people and- I'm not weirded out so I dont mind strange jokes comments or totally random messages- infact I encourage them because they give me a laugh and keep things interesting As much of a fun lover as I am, I try posting quality posts around the forums and I'm also not like, clueless Idk what people think of me though I think I'm hot 
 I am thoroughly confused as to why my post - which was actually an accurate answer to this thread's question - was deleted. I'd love to come in and be all like, "Yeah I don't think anyone here knows who I am, but whatever, who cares, <insert same response everyone else is making>..." but that would just be a bald-faced lie.

 No gives a **** about you kou, go away 

 This is getting tiring. The thread was going perfectly fine until this drama. A4 doesn't need it. Kou, I question your reasons for coming in here and stirring the pot and it's not appreciated as you can see from all the replies. If anyone has any grievances as to why this thread is getting locked, please, by all means send me a PM. I deleted a bunch of posts because they were inciting drama. Locked for same reasons as the other thread.
