[Anime] Death Note Ending Questions *Spoilers*
 If you ask me you already know the answers to those questions in your head somewhere but since death note is soo good and thought out inch by inch to be perfect your just having trouble decompressing. in so many words, your hooked on death note. I had the same problem when I finishd death note questions like did misa kill herself because she was on that building and did light suddenly reincarnate aswell. beyond that I would recommend that you let death note go and allow those questions to leave your mind. light is the boyfriend of life that's hard to dump.
