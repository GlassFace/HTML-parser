[Romance] Nozo x Kimi
 Suga Kimio finds himself hiding in the girls locker room, unable to move or escape the situation as the girls in his school crowd in. Although he originally had no ulterior motives, he found himself panicking as he heard the girls coming in and hid in a locker. Komine Nozomi, one of the shy girls in his class finds him, but surprisingly covers for him. Perplexed but glad, Kimio goes home. Later that night, he gets a text from Nozomi who happens to live across the way on the same floor of the complex they both live in. She blackmails him into agreeing to show each other’s bodies when she texts him. Kimio has to abide by Nozomi’s insane demands or risk ruining his school life so they both start their little peep show through each other’s windows… -------------------------- The Nozo x Kimi manga is a spin-off of Nozoki Ana (Peep Hole), which also had an OVA anime adaptation. The second Nozo x Kimi OVA has been subbed. I believe there should be a 3rd out in Japanese, but all my news sources are down right now. For those who don't know, Nozoki Ana dealt with a similar voyeur situation but through a small peephole/crack in the wall between two apartments. Going by the original work, these are very erotic series. You have been warned.

 Thanks Ned! Sounds intriguing. Almost a bit like golden boy in terms of weirdness.

 I know I really enjoyed Nozoki Ana. I have high expectations for Nozo x Kimi. XD

 Sounds interesting, but what's the status of this? I found 2 episodes. Is that it or is it ongoing or what?
