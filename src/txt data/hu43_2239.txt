[Anime] How is anime shown in Japan? Meaning prime time tv for tv-ma animes?
 I've wanted to know for some time, how do mature audience animes get broadcasted in Japan? Are they like the simpsons and other fox "adult" cartoons? Are animes in general watched by all ages? Are they kind of like soap operas are in the usa? Are there anime only networks like the usa has the nickelodean kids channels - and disney, toon, etc. Thanks. Sent from my Eclipse-X using Tapatalk
