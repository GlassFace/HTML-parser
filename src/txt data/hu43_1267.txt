 An Introduction to Argumentative Theory.
 You know, I for a long time toyed around with making a condensed article about logic back when we had a debate/extended discussion board. It got to be a pretty tough subject to distill in a way that was useful, and I abandoned pretty much every draft. Still, I think there are basics about logic people should understand. 1. Formal, deductive logic is pretty mathematical and there are just a few mathematical-like operators in use with very specific rules on their use (the operators being: if then, and, or, not, for all, there exists). Anything adhering to these mathematical-like rules is valid and anything not adhering to those rules is invalid. 2. There's also a great big class of non-logical inductive type arguments people make where they move from specific to general. That is not logic. Most of the sciences sit on those inductive type foundations (and really can only make statements about likelihoods). The only subjects we have that are truly logical are the mathematical sciences. 3. My great pet peeve, but analogies are usually inductive and really don't count as logic. Anyone who talks about being logical and uses an analogy in the same discussion really doesn't understand the subject. 4. Finally, logic very likely only exists so we don't talk ourselves in circles. It's a fundamental subject to everything, but not the end-all be-all.
