[General Discussion] Are you an optimist, pessimist, realist, or other?
 So do you always look on the bright side? Do you think everything will go against you? Do you just take things as they are? I'm somewhere in the middle. I try to look for the good things but brace for the worse. How about you? How do you look at the world?
