 Vegeta vs Hulk!
 Whatever you need to tell yourself. This isn't an argument. It's a growing list of strengths and accomplishments of one character versus the potential and hypothetical power of another. Vegeta would be no match for Grey Hulk, let alone Green Scar. May as well compare Roshi's turtle to Hulk for all the effect Vegeta would have on green man. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
