 A4 Major Updates - February 23rd, 2010
 Originally Posted by SunWukong I don't know if its just me but sometimes when I sign out of the site and then when I later get back to this site it appears I am still signed in when I already signed out.

What operating system, browser and browser version are you using (eg. Windows XP, Firefox 3.3) Also, when it first happens and it appears you are signed in (even when you are not), try hitting refresh and see if it logs you out.
