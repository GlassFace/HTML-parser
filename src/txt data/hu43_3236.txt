[Game] Are you into gaming?
 I go through periods of nearly non-stop video game playing for around six months. And then I have around six months where I really have no desire to play any video games. It's fairly odd, but it works. Right now, I am in my video gaming phase. I just got Wolfenstein: The New Order and Shadows of Mordor so I will make time eventually to get through those. I am trying to complete Shadows of the Damned right now as well as Skyrim which I have modded to hell and back. I added a mod called the Wheels of Lull which creates a new storyline that introduces the player to the metaphysics of the world of Elder Scrolls. This mod adds new weapons, new armor, a fully fleshed out new world as well as boss battles with boss music. I absolutely love it! 
 I got no regrets And I remember the day that we met There was no way that I could forget you So I followed you home and waited until you were alone... Jack | Gunnerkrigg Court | Boxdog | The Terrible Secret | Poppy OÂ’Possum | Homestuck
