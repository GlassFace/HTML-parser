 Wrong Cosplay?
 Comic characters do have an impact and presence in Japanese animation, so it is actually not so weird to dress up as Batman or Wolverine at an anime con. I see it all the time at cons, and they blend in just fine. Originally Posted by VampirePrincessKairi I've been to many conventions and expos. After seeing weird stuff so much, you become null to it. I threw on my high school plaid skirt, white shirt etc and went to a convention. Didn't know what character I was, but that's how I went. xD People called me all kinds of character names, so my calculations were correct. Dress up in a school girl outfit, and there's bound to be some anime character that looks like you. Pics or it did not happen. Actually, with so many anime's out there, the chances are high. My sister went to a con with her usual outing clothes, and some people thought she was displaying Rinoa from FF8.
