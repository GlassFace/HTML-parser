[Comedy] Danna ga Nani o Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken/I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying
 I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying (旦那が何を言っているかわからない件, Danna ga Nani o Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken) is a Japanese 4-panel manga series by Cool Kyōshinsha. The series is about the daily lives of Kaoru, a hard working Office Lady, and her otaku husband Hajime. Chapters are released online and then published in print by Ichijinsha. The first volume was released on December 29, 2011 and the fourth volume was released on June 26, 2014. An anime television series adaptation is scheduled to air from October 2014. Tamura Yukari will provide the voice of Kaoru and Suzumura Kenichi will provide the voice of Hajime. These are only 3.5 minute episodes, unfortunately... but quite amusing so far!
