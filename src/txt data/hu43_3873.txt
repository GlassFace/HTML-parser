 Looking for appropriate manga/anime for my 9 year old girl
 Unfortunately Kagey, I haven't seen any of the ones that you mentioned. Based on rumour alone, I would pre-screen My Bride is a Mermaid. I don't think it is suitable for a youngster. I think it's an ecchi. Fairytale also has it's moments. I do know that much, but from what I've read, it's basic fanservice. The anime isn't an ecchi, but the manga is. Best to not let her read the manga of this one. xxxholic is tied into Tsubasa Chronicle, which is one that I recommended. It can't be bad. I don't know about any of the other ones at all. And you're welcome.
