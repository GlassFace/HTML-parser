[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 The ending was perfect! It retained that same sense of tragedy with hope rising out of despair, which we saw throughout the entire series. This is exactly what I loved about the show! Kinda happy to see that I was right about the Arus president.
