[Action] Space Dandy - Page 5
 I really wanted this show to be something more than the unadulterated pile of steaming **** that it is. Honestly. It had -one- good episode, the one where Dandy escorts the girl... but that's it. That's the only time I remotely felt anything other than "meh" at the show.

If you're looking for a serious anime; watch one. Space Dandy is supposed to be a random, funny anime that doesn't need to make any sense because **** the viewers. I personally think it does a great job of it too. It's actually really similar to Nichijou and hey, not everyone liked that either. But regardless; if you don't understand the concept of a show, you don't need to get angry at it.

It was advertised very poorly, and with the list of directors and writes it had, as well as the setting that it is based in... they just trolled the people wanting another "Space Cowboy" series, and I'm not happy about it. Nichijou was funny, this show is not. I get the concept of the show, and am not happy with it.

Fair enough, but honestly; I don't understand how you didn't see it being a completely retarded comedy anime. The trailer gave it off for me personally Originally Posted by Gaff Is it reading too much into it to wonder if he and Meow were just tripping the whole time? Dandy seemed really out of it in nine. Dem space drugs doe. 
 That episode with the 2 Aliens fighting to death? Ain't gonna lie, peed myself a little there from laughing so hard. Watched it dubbed as I had friends over. They weren't that impressed but then went mental for the epic ending. Might give the dub another chance after this. Top show, does everything it says on the tin. And the music and backgrounds never cease to stop giving me boners. Anyway, gonna watch trippy episode 9 now. Wootles. 
Do You Even YOLO Bro? 
 Hey, I've watched four episodes of this show, and I found that although it's funny (if you ignore Dandy), Dandy is a prick. All he talks about are boobs and asses. But I do like QT and Meow ( who ironicly kind of looks like Meowth from original Pokemon ). QT is adorable, and well... Meow is just a better guy than Dandy. :P 
 Meow is just more of a closet pervert than Dandy and way more selfish. He is also a cat and a parasite. Sorry, but he is definitely in the principality of prick from where I'm sitting.

 Nearly caught up with it after falling behind for a couple of weeks. Thought 12 was hilarious - I completely lost it at the  Spoiler alien boombox. "BE MAH BABY"...

 Oh God, that Last Dandy was...creepy, sad circumstances too. No, not that awkward as **** cast! lol Really zany premier episode for the new season, it still has that "Dandy" pacing and comedy. 
 How the hell did Dandy manage to pull off a second season?

 Something about Toonami funding it or something...well Funimation funding the second season. There is a reason for the madness and I love Space Dandy.

 Not my type of anime.. Oh well. everybody has different tastes ! 
 Maybe a little late to comment this but the first episode was really funny, I laught a lot with the last Dandy (the sad one). He's referencing the main character of "SDB Natial Police Agency Special Defense Bureau" dorama. Recommended. 
 I'm interested in this show. I'll try out the first few episodes. 
 Happy posting!
 I really liked last week's episode for an odd reason. It really pulled me in and what I thought would have happened didn't happen. 
 Looks like the series is finally over, I liked it more than I thought I would. 
 I remember when I first watched Space Dandy... It was like the best way to start the year! January 1st, they premiered the first episode of Space Dandy. What got my attention was the fact that he liked going to a restaurant named Boobies because that's hilarious! The episodes don't make sense half the time, but I liked it. I don't know if they are going to make another season though.

 I love this show. Cowboy Bebob gets a wack sense of humor. He's a dandy guy.... ...in space. love me some...

 Probably one of the weirdest anime I've seen but it's funny I like it.
