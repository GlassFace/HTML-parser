 Hey! I'm Ari! Not entirely sure how to introduce myself but I'm 16 and I kove anime. I especially like Utena, Inuyasha, Sailor Moon, Madoka Magica, and The Rose of Versailles. Right now I'm watching Neon Genesis Evangelion I draw art and fanart sometimes (for videogames too). Also I might wanna try dubbing a fandub/fanime some time. I also have a tumblr! Me
