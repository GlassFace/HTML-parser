[IC] Glass Academy for Inhuman Beings - Page 37
 Autumn After Autumn's question the temperment of the group seemed to plummet. "That's certainly quite the name, Caedis," Victoria said, Autumn didn't like where Victoria was going with this. "How did you receive such a powerful name?" and with that Autumn's suspicions were realised. Victoria was taking this lightly. Autumn almost growled in frustration. Victoria couldn't see the importance of a name, the way a person's name influenced who they were. Victoria meaning Victory would never understand, Autumn supposed. "Depends on who you ask, but a metonym, I suppose" Caedis said in reply, grinning in such a way that reminded Autumn of repilian shapeshifters, or perhaps a gorgon. Autumn thought for a moment, what exactly was Caedis? The reptailian conotations seemed to fit her, but Caedis didn't have the air of a shapeshifter, she was too comfortable in her form. A variation of demon? perhaps, Autumn didn't know what kind's of demon there were, or even how many there might be. But out of all of Autumn's knowledge of monsters and non-human behings, a gorgon from greek myth seemed to fit her. Coming back out of her thoughts Autumn noticed the air of unease about Caedis. Had Autumn caused her this distress? She really hadn't meant to, Autumn didn't like to think that she had actively cause one of her peers distress. Of all the human qualitys she had picked up, guilt was among the most annoying. With a deep breath Autumn tried to push back down the instinctive fear at hearing a name with such freightening conotations, "Well met Caedis. I am Autumn, from the latin Autumnus. Not a given name but one chosen due to its association with harvest. I would give you my true name but, there is no living human who speaks my native tounge." Autumn said, visibly calming down as she spoke. "How about we get along?" Autumn said smiling lightly at Caedis. 
 Kelos couldn't help feel that many silent exchanges were being passed between the three. With the sudden change in Caedis's demeanor, he could definitely feel the uneasiness in the air, but he couldn't figure out why. He continued to stare down at her, but she refused to meet his eyes, he almost wanted to continue this until she did. Although he was used to such behavior from many of the females, even some males, at the school, he had to admit, he did find it a tiny bit ridiculous. Turning away from her, Kelos continued to walk. He had never heard of the name Caedis before, he wondered if there was some sort of meaning behind it. More than likely there was, but presently, he had no knowledge if this was true of not" Ah Caedis. That's a very nice name." Caedis continued to tell him that she was in fact a part of the late classes. “Oh." He should of asked her first, before telling her to hurry to class. Before he could respond anymore, his eyes went wide a little, due to what was said next by Autumn. Not showing any real reaction to what Autumn presented, he kept walking, and decided to just listen in on the conversation that was bound to come. In all honesty, he knew many students here whose names translated, meant, or symbolized death in some form. It really depended on the family, and in some cases, it was just random. What really peaked his interest was how Autumn said this. Why was she so shocked by this? surley she knew that in our world, or in the world of "other beings" death was sure to be a factor when it came to possibly naming offspring. And due to the fact that there are many, many cultures in our world, there are bound to be different names that in the end can mean the same thing. And in this case " murder" is a good example. Clearly, and reasonably, Autumn knew something about this girl that Kelos didn’t. Now, was it something even important to know? Perhaps, or perhaps not, but due to the fact that she seemed so perturbed, maybe it was something important. As they continued, their now awkward walk, Kelos glanced over at Victoria, who began to put in her opinion. By the expression on her face, which screamed annoyed and possible anger (an expression he noticed she had on her face a lot,) he wondered perhaps she was thinking the same thing as Autumn. What did these two know, that he didn’t? As Victoria continued on, he sensed the shakiness in her voice "Your name, is Death?"Victoria responded ~So?~ Kelos thought to himself. "That's certainly quite the name, Caedis.How did you receive such a powerful name?" ~Powerful?~ Kelos cocked his eyebrow in interest. It seemed there was more to this girl then he thought. Her appearance alone would raise questions, but he was even more intrigued. Kelos glanced over at Caedis, who obviously seemed that she wanted the subject dropped more than anything. When she finally spoke, she was calm, different from how he would of expected her to sound seeing as she looked really uncomfortable moments before. It was clear that the subject of her name, and her origin was a taboo one, this much he concluded. Like a few other students here, some come to escape their past, or get away from problems, or whatever the case may be, but this type of situation he wasn't to unfamiliar with. The silence between them all was, for lack of a better term, highly awkward. The main buildings and other students were beginning to come into view, so without turning to look at them Kelos finally spoke. "It's interesting. So many people attend this school, make friends, and live out their lives in what some of us may call "peaceful" days. But really, how many of us have a past that we wish to keep in the dark, away from others? True horrors haunt some of us. Our families, clans, our people, may even be the cause of some of those horrors. I'm sure the escapism from our darkness, some feel while being here, is truly a great feeling.."Kelos turned and looked at Autumn and Victoria, and smiled "And questioning one's past, or origin could really, unknowingly hurt someone. " Without another word, Kelos turned back around, walked a few more feet, and stopped. The group had reached the courtyard, the big oak tree being about a dozen feet away. It was silent between them all, Kelos hoped he eased the tension between them, and gave Caedis a little more comfort. Maybe her origin did need to be questioned, but looking at it in Caedis's point of view, we were nothing more but strangers asking her personal questions. Turning to look at them, Kelos smiled warmly "Well Ladies, it's been real pleasure. But seeing as I'm a complete mess, I'm going to go clean up, and head to my next class. If you ladies ever need anything, don't be afraid to ask me. If you can't find me, I'll probably be in building F, room 890. The Student Council room. If you both-" He gestured towards Victoria and Caedis "- have nothing to do, I think some students are having a dorm accessorie sell later this afternoon. I know I'll be attending, it'll be a great way to spice up your dorm a bit" In his attempt to lighten up the mood , Kelos did realize using the word "spice" as an adjective, sounded weird coming from him, but he figured it couldn't hurt. " Also,Autumn, if you wish, you can accompany me. Plus there are a few questions I'd like to ask you" He decided to avoid reminding them about class, considering they all more than likely were apart of the night class, but before he left, he did want to make sure the tension was diffused. Turning on his heels, Kelos began to walk off, wish his long blue hair trailing behind him. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~ Picking up the pencil, Kelaras squinted his eyes at the board. In all honesty he really didn't care, but seeing as he was in such a good mood, he actually felt like applying himself today. As class continued on, Kelaras paid attention for the most part, but he did spend a good amount of energy on the drawing he had been working on in the top left corner of his page. Not only that, he was also eavesdropping on the nearby conversations being held silently behind him. One girl was actually working up the courage to ask out the guy who sat way in the front of the class. Another girl and guy were too busy flirting, and passing notes to each other, and another girl, who he knew to be Lyla, who sat right next to him, was busy staring hard at Kade. Kelaras looked back at Kade, who was busy taking notes, and then looked back at Lyla. She was a small girl, with light brown skin, brown hair, and amazing turquoise eyes. He didn't talk to her to much , only when he needed help on homework, but he liked her because she was nice, and would always give him some of her snacks when she had some. Without looking at her, he whispered ever so slightly as to make sure not to draw attention to himself "Why don't you ask him to the dance?" It took awhile for her to realize he was talking to her, but she soon perked up, and glanced at him. Her face turning slightly pink she shook her head " N-no way...he's totally outta my league.. In more ways then one. " Kelaras didn't know what she meant by that " Just. Ask." The girl shook her head again, it was obvious that she was highly embarressed, she sort of reminded him of Hana. Kelaras looked at Raphael, who was still lecturing up at the board, with the book in his hand. Without any warning, Kelaras tapped kade on the shoulder. Her mouth dropping, Lyla stared down at ther paper, and started scribbling on her paper, pretending to be writing stuff down. (I hope this is ok Paperbox!) It took a minute for Kade to respond, for he was still writing down the important bits of whatever Raphael had just said, considering it was going to be on the next test. But when he was done, he turned slightly to face Kelaras and said "What is it? " It wasn't until this moment, that Kelaras acutally felt quite uncomfortable, for what he was about to ask next was going to look very wrong out of context. His face turning slightly red, for he didn't expect Kade to not be discreet at all, he tried to whisper "Are- Are you going to the dance?" He said, a little louder then he meant. A few students glanced over at them, and in turn Kelaras lowered his voice. " I was just....wondering... " Kade didn't respond, but instead gave him a weird look, his eyebrows cocked. Kelaras couldn't read his expression, he thought he almost looked offended. Slowly, Kade turned back around in his seat to face the board. Kelaras sat there, highly embarressed, but he was more so irritated that Kade didn't answer his question. But could he really blame him, it did seem sort of gay. Lyla was holding her breath from anxiety. She looked over at Kelaras and stared at him. She stiffled a giggle, and in turn Kelaras glared at her. Whispering, so only she'd hear " Well....that didn't go as planned.." ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~ 

 Laundry Room Gang Just as the large boy was about to get his revenge on John, two other boys arrived to defend him. Despite how much he tried, he could not get to any of them. Darrel, and the much shorter kid (who can manipulate fire) were pretty much shoved out of the way so the larger boy and the long haired boy could take on the fight. Soon the tree that Darrel set on fire collapsed and John, in an amazing show of acrobatics, leaped over it, mocking a cheer for his feat. However his cheer was short lived as he soon found himself unable to move. He was stuck with his hands in the air, much to his confusion. However, he was not the only one, The rather large boy was also frozen mid punch and Aleth and Fallen were equally stuck. The long haired boy, Darrel, and the fireball boy were also frozen. The only trait they all had in common was the thin nearly invisible ring around each of them. What is going on here?! shouted a masculine voice. Walking up between both sides of the fight was arather tall teacher dressed in a lab coat, and had a pair of safety goggles around his neck. Right behind him ran two other men, one dowsing the fire and the other re-growing the tree. The teacher looked at both sides to see who was involved, before sighing. He walked around the boys to see what damage has been done all the while mumbling to himself. Ever since Juliana disappeared I swear, this school has dropped intothe very pits of hell. IN one day, one day, the cafeteria, the laundry room, basketball courts, and now the court yard has been destroyed. After his sweep helooked back at the kids. What makes you kids think you have the right to demolish school property? You cannot just come and go all willy-nilly doing whatever the heck you want. He was very angry with his words, and as much as any of them wanted to speak, none of them could, which the teacher enforced by standing in front of John, asking him what he was thinking directly. Of course John could not respond, and the teacher moved on. You are all in serious trouble, and if Hucklebee wont do anything, then I will. Raising his hand each of the frozen students rose into the air and floated behind him as he walked to the administration building. As he continued to walked he made a list of each of the students. mumble mumble mumble,Fallen Zephson, Aleth Seer, John Kerr, Darrel Ritmaster, Gavin Fredview (big guy), Makray Huld (fire manipulator), Shorty Long (long haired boy), mumble mumble mumble. Soon they arrived in front of a door, The door was different than the others as it was pure white. The teacher opened the door and put each of the boys inside. Only then did the nearly transparent ring disappear and allowed the boys movement. As soon as the last student was inside he shut the door. Once the door was shut, it was nolonger seen, as though the room had no exits. There were a collection of desks in the room as though it were a class room, except everything was white. In the far back corner sat an older man wearing what appeared to be travelers clothes. Hello there, John. Has your memories returned yet? asked Darris. 
  Spoiler 
 (Sorry for the abrupt ending. I had a whole ordeal where Kade involved himself with the fight between John, Fallen, Aleth and the laundry room gang but Randoms beat me to it lol.) Kades dark brown eyes focused intently at the board as Mr. Raphael Haven lectured the class. Although he had already read the lesson in the class textbook last night, Kade took detailed notes believing that an outside opinion of the lesson allowed for deeper understanding. The class was certainly lively today as most students appeared to be gleefully conversing among one another. A conversation between a few girls within ear shot of Kade grew louder as their excitement seemed to grow. Kade didnt pay attention much of the conversation since it wasnt his business, but he couldnt help but pick up something about a dance. Dance? Kade thought to himself. Shaking his head, Kade had better things to do than attend something so trivial; his species hung by a thread. Shortly after Kade had jotted down a few more notes, someone had tapped his right shoulder. Assuming it to be Kelaras, Kade sighed and turned slowly to look over his left shoulder at Kelaras. What is it? He said with neither a friendly nor hostile tone. Kelaras seemed to grow a little uneasy as Kade stared him down, awaiting an answer. "Are- Are you going to the dance?" Kelaras said as students around the two turned around in response to such a question. Kade stared at him pondering whether or not Kelaras was attempting to insult him. "I was just....wondering..." Kelaras followed up. Kades eyebrows cocked in a peculiar fashion as his deep brown eyes bore into Kelaras. For a brief moment, Kade assumed his question to not be insulting, but rather a genuine inquiry. Turning slowly back around, Kade returned his gaze to the board which had a few extra sentences added among the vast wall of notes. Letting out a light sigh, he assumed Kelaras was playing messenger as he didnt strike Kade as someone whod play for the other team so-to-speak. Questions of his own filled his mind as he filtered out the situation. Why in Lucifers name would anyone want to go to something as insignificant as a dance? Especially with him? Kade tapped his finger on his desk in an anxious manner as he thought of going to the dance with another. He never was good with people, growing up in a research lab as a subject has those kinds of negative effects. He was destined to mate with another Xeretic in order to continue his bloodline, thats all that was planned for him when he was born. Excellent grades, intense training and endless research were all done in order to keep up the Xeretic name no matter how much they had disappeared from common knowledge. Without his species, Kade didnt have a place nor did he have a home to return to, should one someday arise. Kade turned head once more over his left shoulder and spoke quietly to Kade. I assume you are asking as a messenger for another. Honestly, I had not planned on it seeing as I dont have a Kade awkwardly paused like his tongue had been stolen from him mid-sentence. Date. The word was difficult for Kade to say as if it was something foreign to which he did not understand. A moment passed as the silence grew between the two. If someone is interested in me for such an event, I do not have much to offer. I have more pressing matters to attend to Kade turned to look outside once more as his eyes followed nature as it elegantly lived on in order to break his mind away to think for a moment. A bird happily chirped as it tended to its new born children who greeted the bird wholeheartedly. It soothed his aura as he calmed himself. Even though he already knew his destiny, he felt an aching need in the back of his mind for companionship; a friend would be nice. As he stared out of the window at those joyful birds, Kade seemed to begin to change his mind. Even so I.. The bell suddenly rang signifying the end of the current classes in session. Snapping Kade out of his trance, he stood up from his desk and packed his stuff forgetting about the conversation all together.

 Caedis tried to swallow her unease, but it wouldn’t go down without a fight. Out of all the topics that could’ve come up, why did it have to be the origin of her name? That was a conversation she would only like to have with people she trusted - and Victoria was not someone she was inclined to trust at this current moment. She’d sooner talk about underwear preferences. She feared that any little thing she did or said, could and would be used against her. How vexing it was - she wanted to growl in frustration like some savage beast, one that had been poked one-too-many times by an overly-curious stick. She certainly had the teeth and stare for it - it was only a short amount of time before it became a matter of claws. "Well met Caedis. I am Autumn, from the Latin ‘Autumnus’. Not a given name, but one chosen due to its association with harvest. I would give you my true name but, there is no living human who speaks my native tongue." Autumn’s words soothed the beast within. It was a pretty name. Simple, yes, but nonetheless beautiful. How wonderful it would be to be associated with both such a captivating and important time of the year. Caedis wanted to inform the name’s owner of its charm, yet she held back. She didn’t feel comfortable enough to speak in such a way, despite the good impression the little vixen gave - cute and friendly, she seemed someone who could be trusted. But she would have to remain conservative in her words, she decided, given her current company. Except, the additional mention of the name’s Latin origin only fascinated her more, fueling her frustration with herself, and although she kept the comments internal, one could tell of what she was thinking of by the smile that sneaked across her face. She was one easily enthralled by languages, and, somewhat hypocritically, the origins of names. She could tell that she would enjoy speaking with this girl when she got the proper chance, perhaps even on the specifics of their names, considering Autumn had been so kind as to share her’s. Grudgingly, however, Caedis felt that time was not now. “Let’s get along,” Autumn smiled amiably. Yes, Caedis reckoned they would, and she smiled back. Of course, that wasn’t to say she disliked the two others who stood around them as silent bystanders, and it certainly didn’t mean she wouldn’t enjoy getting along. Caedis was just experiencing a common personal issue - finding her comfort zone with others, namely Victoria. Despite the initial discomforts, Kelos had a certain strength and dependability to him, Ceadis could sense it, and she reckoned she’d get over having been stared at for such an uncomfortable amount of time - he also scored extra points in her book for complementing her name, despite how strongly she disagreed with the comment. On the other side of the spectrum, Victoria didn’t seem to exhibit traits much like Kelos, and Caedis decided it would be best to avoid her - more so for the fact that her dislike for the pale-faced cambion was so blatantly obvious, that an earthquake, a hurricane, and a tidal wave in symphony would have been less conspicuous. Despite this most unfortunate factor, Caedis figured the girl might just have a tiny, tiny, vague little bit of niceness buried away inside her - somewhere in there. "It's interesting,” Kelos suddenly spoke up like a statue come to life, looking at the group with that sharp, studious stare of his. “So many people attend this school, make friends, and live out their lives in what some of us may call ‘peaceful’ days. But really, how many of us have a past that we wish to keep in the dark, away from others? True horrors haunt some of us. Our families, clans, our people, may even be the cause of some of those horrors. I'm sure the escapism from our darkness, some feel while being here, is truly a great feeling...-" Caedis had hardly expected anything philosophical being injected into the conversation, but she supposed she should have seen it coming - the importance of names was a gateway topic for such things. The short little monologue had given her a sense of ease, however. In a small little way, she felt a bit more comfortable. Things still felt odd though - foreign, even. He looked upon the others, and he smiled. "-And questioning one's past, or origin, could really, unknowingly hurt someone." Caedis had to look up at the sky in order to think - she couldn’t digest the words well with the glances that she knew would begin circling. She let her gaze drift on over to Kelos - she wanted to smile and thank him for his curtesy, but all the girl could manage was a blank, lifeless stare. She didn’t feel all too well - in fact, she felt oddly sick to her stomach. She couldn’t tell why, exactly, or even how. It wasn’t one of those cheesy “butterflies in the girl’s stomach when she looked at the boy” moments. No, it was some other type of “sick”. That kind of sick you get when you change altitude too quick, or when one jumps from an air-conditioned home into a desert summer outdoors - or even that sickness you feel when someone laughs in your face, or when a friend insults a gift. Caedis could tell that she would have trouble adjusting. Suddenly, the group was in motion again, and within the distance of a few meters they had stopped, destination reached. They were in a courtyard of sorts. Caedis remembered seeing the place a great number of times, but she never dared tread upon it during the day - it was too open, too hot, and much too agoraphobic for her liking. Additionally, it often had a surplus of people far exceeding what Caedis enjoyed to be around. Luckily for them, they were its sole pedestrians. Kelos turned to them and smiled. It was a nice, warm, genial smile, and it went nicely with the words that ensued. "Well Ladies, it's been real pleasure. But seeing as I'm a complete mess, I'm going to go clean up, and head to my next class. If you ladies ever need anything, don't be afraid to ask me.” He offered politely. Caedis to nodded in silent thanks and understanding. “If you can't find me, I'll probably be in building F, room 890. The Student Council room. If you both-" He continued, gesturing towards Victoria and Caedis - the pale one felt a slight tingle run down her spine. "-have nothing to do, I think some students are having a dorm accessory sale later this afternoon. I know I'll be attending, it'll be a great way to spice up your dorm a bit." Caedis gave a rebounding glance to a silent Victoria, and found herself just as noiseless. With effort, Caedis consciously kept the muscles in her face relaxed to retain a neutral expression. Kelos must have had high expectations of them eventually getting along, for the idea of Kelos not seeing their obvious conflict between them seemed ludicrous. Although, despite her unwillingness to admit it up front, Caedis did want to get along with everyone if possible - and that included Victoria. It seemed, though, that Kelos wasn’t quite done speaking. Not moments after the last syllable had left his mouth, Kelos continued: “Also, Autumn,” He said, turning to his vulpine companion to which he was well acquainted. “If you wish, you can accompany me. Plus there are a few questions I'd like to ask you." Caedis frowned. Or rather, she twitched, the muscles in her lips having a momentary lapse in judgement. She had been rather keen on speaking to Autumn herself, but by the looks of it, that would have to wait. Kelos had beaten her to it, it seemed, but Caedis was only moderately bothered by it - he’d been talking to her first, anyways. It would be discourteous to steal her away from Kelos, and Caedis didn’t want to be rude; she’d already used up all her rude reserves on Victoria - albeit accidentally, of course. Kelos turned, and he began treading off in that casually stoic way of his. Caedis watched him depart in front of a cascade of blue, before she set her sights on the shortest of the group. “See you some other time.” Caedis murmured, partially to the departing party member, and partially to the little vixen in her sights whom would be trailing after any moment. Although quiet and cryptic, her words possessed a perceivable sincerity. “A pleasure meeting you,” Caedis lightly smiled.

 Autumn Autumn felt relieved as Caedis smiled back at her. Caedis seemed to be one of few words, but then again Autumn had lived a hundred years without words. She had learned to read the subtle signs in the body. A slight tilt of the head, the tension in the muscles, the way they stood, it all hinted at the truth behind the facade. From what Autumn could tell Caedis had lost quite alot of the tension she had been holding before, which suggested she had calmed down, or was feeling more comfortable. Autumn was happy that Caedis seemed to be more at ease, Autumn knew it could be difficult to be different, to be foreign. "It's interesting,” Kelos said with his usual cool demenour “So many people attend this school, make friends, and live out their lives in what some of us may call ‘peaceful’ days. But really, how many of us have a past that we wish to keep in the dark, away from others? True horrors haunt some of us. Our families, clans, our people, may even be the cause of some of those horrors. I'm sure the escapism from our darkness, some feel while being here, is truly a great feeling...-" Autumn supposed it was true. There were bound to be people from dark pasts, who wished only to forget what had passed. Perhaps Kelos was even speaking from experience. Autumn couldn't understand wanting to forget. She had always lived as a fox does, parts of that Autumn was sure human would call a dark past, but it was those experoence that made Autumn who she was now, she wouldn't have learned from those experiences. "-And questioning one's past, or origin, could really, unknowingly hurt someone." Kelos said finishing his philosophical monologue. Autumn didn't know him well enough to know if this was normal for him, but it still seemed a little out of place. "Well Ladies, it's been real pleasure. But seeing as I'm a complete mess, I'm going to go clean up, and head to my next class. If you ladies ever need anything, don't be afraid to ask me.” Kelos said politely with a nod to caedis “If you can't find me, I'll probably be in building F, room 890. The Student Council room. If you both-" Kelos gestured to Victoria and Caedis "-have nothing to do, I think some students are having a dorm accessory sale later this afternoon. I know I'll be attending, it'll be a great way to spice up your dorm a bit." Autumn thought about her own dorm. It was a simple human domicile, with a green decor to imitate the forrest foliage. Autumn wsn't sure what else someone would need, but then again human's were weirdly over the top about possessions. Perhaps this was an extention of that? Without missing a beat Kelos kept talking but this time his words were meant for Autumn “Also, Autumn,” Kelos said, turning to face Autumn “If you wish, you can accompany me. Plus there are a few questions I'd like to ask you." Autumn supposed it would be fine to go with him. She didn't really have anything to be doing. Autumn ws most likely to have gone and found a warm patch of sun in which to sleep. "Ok, I didn't have anything planned to do anyway." Autumn said cheerfuly. But before Autumn trailed after Kelos's retreatinf back, she noticed Caedis watching her. “See you some other time.” Caedis murmured almost inaudably. “A pleasure meeting you,” she said with a slight smile. Autumn smiled back, "I'll see you later ok?" she said with a wave to Caedis as well as Victoria before quickly closing the distance between her and Kelos's retreating form. "So what did you want to ask?" Autumn said rather blunt in the delivery of the question, it wasn't that she was being rude or hostile, but rather that Autumn had never seen any point in being anything other than direct. 
 Victoria Victoria listened to Kelos' monologue with an unmatched level of apathy. She couldn't care less about how her inquiries made others feel. At this particular moment in time, all she cared about was finding John. Snapping back into focus she noticed that the group had moved, and, sub-consciously, she had moved with them. They were now in the courtyard, where just a week ago, John appeared out of thin air. She glanced over to the scorch mark on the walkway. It was beginning to fade. The rumors of John's appearance seemed to die down rather quickly. It seems inhuman beings had a low attention span, just like humans did. Then Kelos spoke again. This time, he mentioned a dorm accessory sale somewhere. I don't even attend this school! Why would I go? She thought to herself. He also mentioned where to find him, should they need to contact him again. Room 890 in building F. Kelos then turned on his heels and left. Caedis glanced over at Victoria, who stood silent and motionless, then soon after, Autumn said her goodbyes and followed Kelos. Once out of earshot of Kelos and Autumn she turned back to Caedis and looked at her for a moment, observing her features and body movements. Victoria was thinking about what to say next. Should I follow up with another insult? Confront her? Or simply disengage the situation? Victoria thought to herself while staring at Caedis. She let out a small cough and scratched her forearm. Not because she needed to cough, or even because she had an itch. She felt genuinely unsettled by the fact that Kelos suggested that they do an activity together. Is he that oblivious that he couldn't see I don't like her? She thought to herself. Victoria decided that Caedis wasn't going to speak, so she would have to break the silence herself. She contemplated simply walking away, without a word. The thought of starting where the left off had already fleeted her mind. She had already re-focused her priority to finding John. "Well" She said, "I have other things to do." Victoria turned on her heels and began walking in the opposite direction of Caedis. She wasn't sure where, exactly she was going, but away from that freak was good enough for now. John While celebrating his impressive display of gymnastics, John was suddenly stopped in his tracks. He was unable to move. "What the hell!?" he shouted as he struggled to escape the grasp of the teacher. "What is going on here?!" he heard. It was obviously a teacher, seeing how impressive the magical barrier was. He glanced at the teacher and noticed that he was wearing a lab coat and goggles. "What makes you kids...-the heck you want!" He said angrily. He seemed to be directing the words at John. His smile turned into a scowl and his good mood was ruined. He was now royally p*ssed. He was never one who could agree with authority. "Don't you have a frog to dissect?" He attempted to say in rebuttal, but found he was unable to speak. He won't even let me stand up for myself. F*CKING PIG. John thought to himself. John was whisked away, floating behind the upset teacher. He could hear him mumbling under his breath. He began reading the signs, and deduced they were headed to the admin building to receive punishment. As they were being dragged along, he noticed the other students laughing at them. They were pointing as they passed and spoke under their breath. John looked at the ground, frustrated. He was so mad he wasn't seeing straight. His vision began to blur and his veins began to pop out of his head.Realizing he was far too upset to be healthy, he began breathing deeply. In..... Out..... In...... Out..... He repeated in his head. His breaths began to slow and he started to calm down. As he calmed down, he noticed that the floor had changed. He was now on granite steps. He looked up and was greeted by a pure white door. They were less than delicately put in the room after the teacher opened the door. Once inside John saw the rings disappear, and began rolling his neck. He turned back, to maybe try to escape, but the door was gone. Right... magic.... He noticed that the room looked like a room to put crazy people in. It seemed like a classroom, but everything was white. Then he noticed an old man in worn clothes. That old man from earlier? He thought. "Hello there, John. Has your memories returned yet?" He asked. John looked at the ground. Do I just tell him, in front of everyone? John decided it was best just to answer him truthfully, regardless of who heard. What did he care what others though, anyways? "Unfortunately, no." He responded. He then looked around to see what the room had to offer. There were desks lined up, facing a seemingly untouched whiteboard. There was one black marker, and eraser resting on the whiteboard. There didn't seem to be tiles, either. The floor looked like a giant slab of pure-white marble. John wasn't sure where the light was coming from either, as there didn't seem to be any bulbs. It was just, bright. This place weirds me out.... He thought to himself, and began aimlessly playing with his lip ring. 
 Fallen "C'mon you damn ginger!" swinging his body rearwards, Fallen dodged the fists of a what seemed to be a 5^7 or 5^8 orc, "Damn you." As the vial creature spat out his words he tilted his head, the things pitch black eyes revealed a fierce look as if he was going to tear Fallen to itsy bitsy chunks of flesh and puddles of blood. The ground began to shake as the tree from before had slammed to the ground, apparently they hadn't caused enough impairment to the courtyard. "And the crowd goes wild!" Slightly flinching to the yell of John, Fallen glanced back a bit to see that he was standing with his arms up in the air, ~He seems to clearly be enjoying himself, hope he enjoys paying the impairments for this place~. As the orc twisted back around pouncing forwards, Fallen struck out his right arm, a large gush of wind blew out and slammed the malodorous orc to the ground. "You fuc-" yanking it's bulky pudgy head back down into the dirt, the burning trees root rapped around the orcs mouth to silence him. "Didn't your parents ever tell you to watch your mouth or you will get a whip lash?" Smirking at the defeated creature, Fallen felt a bit relieved. Finally, he was able to take out his anger that he had held up inside him throughout the school year. "Fallen, I am quite certain that you yourself have a difficult time holding back your tongue as-well" "You intend to cuss towards me also Aleth?" Fallen joked as he faced his blue haired chum watching as his friend quickly teleported from where he once was to now where he stood withing two feet in front of him as if he was daring him. "What shall it be?" the mischievous smirk grew widely onto Aleths pale face. slanting his head fallen nodded as if they were speaking with each others minds. Yet, the both of them caught on quickly to the surrounding noises.. a small itching noise of a twig splitting to the force of a foot slamming down on it. Both waiting for the seconds to fly by for them to make a move they finally both turned their heads and stepped back as two creatures almost lost their balance to them almost slamming into the two boys. Both taking a step back foward they stared down at the bullys who stood back up and marched towards them, swinging their fists through the air they stopped in mid air due to some sort of force, Fallen and Aleth suddenly were both unable to move. "Hmm, okay that is a tad bit odd," only able to move his eyes and mouth, Fallen looked around to see that every other being involved in the quarrel were still as if their bodies had been made to become manicans for some clothing store in a mall. What is going on here?! A voice rumbled throughout the court yard, neither one of the boys were quite sure of whether it was coming from a man or a women. Sort of answering their thoughts, of what looked to be a man that... sort of had a woman's face began walking up and in between the separate groups of beings. "Bloody hell... is that a drag queen?" Aleth whispered nearly causing the others including the two boys who were bullies to laugh a bit trying to hold it all back. Two men ran up from behind the teacher taking a whip of breath. One of them who were healing the burnt tree pulled it back up, the root began to pull back into the ground, leashing out the fear of the orc being pulled back with it... his facial expression showed that he really believed he was about to be part of the dirt that he belonged with, instead he was released but also frozen just as much as the rest of the young men. Ever since Juliana disappeared I swear, this school has dropped into the very pits of hell..." Fallen just kept his mouth shut as the teacher whispered to them self, ~who ever said this academy wasn't hell?~ "...You cannot just come and go all willy-nilly doing whatever the heck you want. Going on and on, it began to be a boring story to everyone. No one really seemed afraid of him, it was more of them just wishing they could get far away so that they did not have to hear him ramble on and on. Before casting off to sleep, Fallen felt his body lift up in the air slightly, the group of boys were now hovering on behind the drag queen man and into some sort of detention room. Once all of the boys were inside the pure white room, that appeared to be similar to the rooms for the insane people to be trapped in, the transparent frame around them began to dissolve. The desks surrounding each of them sort of made them want to jump out of the crap hole and make an escape into somewhere else. Hello there, John. Has your memories returned yet? An older man spoke, breaking the silence. Everyone now glanced over to see his eyes strike over to the john boy, "Unfortunately, no." Well, this was interesting. Fallen leaned back against a white wall, "Memory loss? What a shame." looking around Fallen wasn't exactly sure what take of the room they were stuck in. "Well, they could have added a bit more color," Two of the bullies sat down in desks, they looked completely exhausted and it was sort of obvious that the giant boy was never going to fit his big rock hard butt into a desk chair. What sort of detention room was this?

 The silence between them was long and uncomfortable, and Caedis couldn’t help but feel a boiling frustration begin to build as the spiteful girl before her continued to look at her in such hateful a way. But she wouldn’t do anything about it. No, the modern era didn’t allow for the things it used to. “Well,” Victoria finally began amidst the silence. “I have other things to do.” Her words were curt and to the point. Caedis only stared in response, not in the mood to speak. Victoria turned away, rather eagerly, and began a brisk walk in the opposite direction - away from Caedis. “I’ll see you later.” Caedis said eerily as the girl trotted away with the distinctive scent of indignation. Although, you might not see me. It took until that moment for Caedis to realize just how hot it really was. It was scorching. She wiped her brow, and found it was covered in sweat. It was so hot, that she questioned just what on earth could have possibly possessed her to come out into the sun. She hated the sun with a passion more fiery than, coincidentally, the sun. All she wanted to do at this point was curl up in some dark room somewhere with the windows shut and the curtains drawn - no one to disturb her. Only, there was someone to disturb her, her memory nagged. Rather than having a personal lair to herself as she was used to, she remembered that she would now have to share a room with a roommate, someone she didn’t know. A new room, new people - It was all rather stress-inducing. “Ugh,” she grunted to herself as she made her leave, finding slight respite in the shadows of the building as she made her way inside. 
 Darris "Well that is a shame. Oh well. I am surprised to see you here though." said Darris clapping John's shoulder before walking around the room, avoiding the other students, speaking as though only John was there. "Well since it's pretty much inpossible to get out of here, why don't you tell me what you learned? I mean, an hour with your friends might of helped you come to some sort of realizations." Darris continued to keep speaking like this on and on explaining randomness about this and that, until the large orc boy shouted. "Shut up. No one give a d*** about that punk." He spoke is almost perfect english. Well he managed to pronounce his words, as though he just suddenly became sober. Darris turned towards him realizing that there were other students in the room with John. "I beg your pardon. I did not mean to interrupt you. I suppose there must of been some sort of interaction between you lot if you are all her at the same time." said Darris, being almost ablivious to the tension some of the students, and bullies were giving off. "You got that right. You think this place will help you? You are going to get it now!" The orc boy stood up straighter with his fists in the air. Some of his gang mates stood up next to him. "Donald." he said "Darrel." said the shortest of the bunch "Whatever. Do something to keep them from running." said the orc boy. "I can't..." began Darrel, but before he could continue, the orc boy turned and punched him in the face, knocking him back several feet. "FIne then." the orc boy then tried to pick up one of the chairs, but they were seemingly bolted to the floor. SOmehow this left the orc boy confused. No matter how he tried, the table would not budge. Giving up on the chair, he prepared to punch John. Fallen and Aleth reacted, but it was Darris who blocked the punch. Using the white orb he usually carries, he out it in his palm and let the orc boy punch it, hurting is hand, which also surprised and confused him even more. "If you let your friend there finish, you would of known that in this room, all super natural powers are useless." said Darris. "I'm not sure what it is, but nothing works in here." Darris looked down in thought, stashing his white orb into his coat once again. "Now, I would appreciate it if you would not try to do harm to my friend here." Darris then patted John's shoulder as he took a seat at the back of the room once again. The orc boy glared at him, but snorted when Fallen and Aleth seemed to inch their way to John's defense. He walked back to the rest of the group and sat on top of the table. Darrel stood up and wiped some blood from his nose before sitting a few chairs away form the laundry room gang. 
  Spoiler 
 Fallen Leaning back in the pure white marble chair . He was growing bored of the other group of boys gathering up as if they were some sort of legendary school gang. Yet, they were all inadequite pieces of sh*t that stood there in front of them looking pretty pathetic. Watching as the hideous orc boy turned it's body and punched it's "Buddy" in the face, Fallen knew it was all going to go down hill from there. ~Eh what a boring little group~ Twisting the leg of the chair to a forty-five degree angle, Fallen faced Aleth who seemed to be drawing on the table-top with a pencil. Glancing down at the picture it seemed to be a picture of the group of boys looking even dorkier than before in dresses, "Gowns?" Aleth looked up to Fallen and smiled innocently as if nothing was wrong, "Well doesn't everyone go to the prom?" Leaning in, Aleth began to add a tiara to the midget of the group, "I figured these would be the perfect ideas for outfits for the drama-queens." Both Fallen and Aleth grew silent listening to the grunts of the orc. Looking over, they watched as he tried with a large amount of strength to pull the chairs from the ground, which he clearly was failing. The facial expression was near priceless, watching as it turned beat tomato red and as if he had just lost his junk.. The orc seem to have change it's mind about the chairs and tried to budge at the desk. "I believe a desk is heavier than a chair, also doubt that they are going to let you move the tables when you can't even move the chairs," Seemed as if the creature was absent of a mind. Trying to hold back from laughing, Fallen thought back to the old movie named the wizard of oz and began to sing, "♫I wish I had a brain!♪" The orc looked over it's shoulder and grinded it's teeth, it was giving up on picking the furniture up from the ground. Instead it seemed he was going to use it's own muscle now. As the orc swung it's fists through the air, both Fallen and Aleth jumped out of their chairs and began to pick their feet up towards John and the orc. Darris making it there before they had a chance and blocked the fist with his palm, "If you let your friend there finish, you would of known that in this room, all super natural powers are useless." And there it was, the orc just made itself look like a complete idiot right in front of the rest of it's gang. "Now, I would appreciate it if you would not try to do harm to my friend here." The orc's face seemed extremely pissed as he began to walk away and slammed his fat a** on to the table, "Careful, you don't want to put a dent in it. It appears expensive" Aleth spoke in a manner that seemed as if he was very gentleman like. Looking around, Fallen just sighed and shook his head. "We should probably honestly put our differences aside, it was a pretty damn epic fight but in the end... it was also a bit petty," Shaking his head Fallen thought back of how immature they all looked, destroying property and causing destruction and throwing fists for whatever reason, there really didn't seem to be one. "If we plan to get out of this insanity room, we might as well get along," Aleth seemed to agree now. The faces of the others, the laundry room gang, began the change. They seemed to each to be considering the thought... it was obvious that none of them wanted to be stuck in this room and they probably were looking back at the past of the fight, it was more to waste time more than anything. "Yeah probably..." Said Darrel, he was probably sick and tired of being in the room and felt like and idiot now for all that was happening. No matter what, the orc just didn't seem to care, clearly he was sucked into his own thoughts... or at least the little thoughts he could develop. It was all pretty much trouble, they didn't need to get suspended from the Academy any time soon so they shouldn't have encouraged it. Glancing over towards John, Fallen smiled. Maybe it was better that the kid didn't have his memories, from what he could remember, it was all trouble for everyone before John and the other group of students escaped through the "force field" sort of effect. Ever since they all returned and they had a new headmaster, it seemed that the school had took a turn for the right. Yet, it was difficult to actually say whether it really did or not... but they were probably going to find out sooner our later. Walking over towards to Darris Fallen smiled, "I was wondering, how exactly did you get in here?" he whispered to Darris, it was a bit odd how when they entered, Darris was there... what exactly was this man doing at Glass... (I will begin my Namine and Kyrs post tonight and tomorrow)

 "Now... This is just pure epicness... considering this place isn't even on the maps..." Marveled Kuno. Standing at the front entrance of the Class Academy building, Kuno was stunned, a building with a style he's never seen before. To him, this building is most brilliant, even attracting. He moved onward, tired of his travels. Kuno's luggage was simple, a medium sized rolling travel bag with a big cat sticker on the front of it, he pulled it with him as it slowly rolled across the academy courtyard. "Why didn't I come here earlier... " Kuno thought, as he entered the massive, beautifully decorated hall located in the center of the academy. The floor he stood on was clear and reflective, and the glasses the entire structure were cold-looking and calming. He couldn't believe how a school like this can be built. Walking around examining the whole building, Kuno decided to settle down and deal with the first things first - The headmaster's office. He was so stoked, his entire body shook from the thought of heart-warming friends, people who would actually accept him for who he is, where he could use his power and not be stared at with a weird face, a place where he doesn't need his insufferable aunts and uncles... Then he got lost, turning around in big, big circles as he past rooms by rooms. Feelings strange how there were less than few people walking the halls. A sign then caught his attention, right near the entrance he came in from - "Headmaster's Office".Kuno then shrugged at himself, started to walk towards the direction located by the sign. A big, solid wooden door was then presented to him, it's beautifully decorated and powerful looking. It was quite hard to keep himself calm now, as different images popped up in his head, of who could the headmaster of this academy be? What should he say? What will he do? *Thump thump* Kuno raised his hands and knocked on the door. 
​
 Caedis sighed in relief as the shade of the building enveloped her like a soothing blanket on a cold winter night. Only the opposite was true, as she was seeking the opposite of warmth. The sun was stifling and uncomfortable, and she was glad to be rid of it. But what would she do now? The halls were empty, and she wasn’t in much of a mood to go shopping for dorm accessories at the time being. Despite having to meet with the unsavory Victoria, and having to roast in the sun, Caedis had found the encounter with other individuals somewhat refreshing, and a small part of her in the back of her brain secretly craved more. It was still well before nightfall, and there was plenty of time before her classes begun - not that they were consequential, at least to her, anyways. She supposed she could sleep, but she felt that it might still be too hot to relax in her dorm room - her new one at that, one that she knew she'd have to try to get comfortable in at some point. She grimaced - it would be along process. It was just then that her ears picked up the distinctive pitter-patter of feet on the smooth floors of the vacant academy hall. Instinctively, Caedis sprung to alert, darting into the shadows just as a peculiar voice rang through the hall. "Why didn't I come here earlier...?" It sang in wonder as a boy, probably somewhat around Caedis' age in terms of appearance, appeared from around the bend with a look of stupefied glee. Caedis ducked further into hiding as the boy advanced, and as he did so, it became obvious that he was so hopelessly enamored with what he saw, that Caedis truly wondered if he would have noticed her if she had simply stood out in the open. Clearly, by how he eyed the architecture like a toddler in a candy shop, he was a fresh arrival. The boy was small, reasonably so, and possessed short-cropped hair that ran black like the feathers of a raven down just past his ears. He dressed rather oddly in contrast to what she was used to seeing among the regulars at the school, but by no means did Caedis see it negatively - in fact, she rather adored it. They seemed rather equal in height, but Caedis wasn't sure - maybe she was a little taller, maybe she was a little shorter, but it was difficult to discern. Despite that pupating social butterfly inside her, Caedis' lower brain function wouldn't allow her to emerge from hiding. No, this was how she approached all strangers, regardless of how friendly or charming they might seem. As the boy started gaining distance away from his unseen observer, Caedis tucked a strand of white inside her hood as she began to do what she did best - following people in such a way that, if they knew, they would hastily file a restraining order and possibly a warrent for her arrest. As the stranger made his unaccompanied journey towards his goal, his unknown shadow did the same, stealing herself through the darkness as if she were a living part of it. What a glorious way to occupy time! - She thought to herself. She hardly thought she would get the opportunity to play one of her favorite games, and she was amused, to say the very least. As they traveled, Caedis studied him further, meticulously noting the stygian colors of his unusual clothes and the spark of energy that twinkled like a night star in his dark eyes. Looking at other people's features was always such a great pastime for the girl who fiendishly clung to the shadows - she felt like it was a good way of getting to know someone. And for someone who preferred not to talk to others, it was a very efficient method. After a short while of the game Caedis had made of the boy's innocent and ignorant journey, he finally stopped before his destination: the Headmaster's office. Caedis supposed she should have seen it coming - he was new, it'd be fairly obvious that his first stop would be the attention of the one in charge. She frowned, half of her wanting again to come out and greet the boy before he would inevitably disappear behind the door. She acted against the urge again, however. Perhaps she would simply wait for him. Yes, she reckoned as she stood still and silent in the dark like a lurking serpent. She supposed she would just have to wait. 
 Banging the side of the TV as hard as he could with his fist, Shin glared intently at the continuing static on the screen. Even after 30 minutes it still wasn't letting up, and with all the banging and thrashing, it seemed to be only getting worse. Leaning back from the TV, just about to give up, Shin looked back at Jerry-the red eyed tux demon who so graciously allowed him into his room- and shook his head. The TV was truly a piece of sh*t, Shin couldn't figure out why anyone would have something like this. For one thing it was so big and thick, that it was practically almost impossible to move, and because the screen itself was so small, it was hard to make out anything on it. But really he couldn't complain, this was the best he was gonna get. The room they were in was full of junk, clothes for men, women, and children laid strewn out everywhere,garbage littered every corner,pens, and sewing needles flooded the floor, and random colorful pieces of cloth hung from wall. Gadgets of all sizes, that would make an old collector cry with joy smothered his table, Shin guessed the guy was not only a designer, but perhaps a tinkerer of some kind. Even though calling the place a pig sty would definitely be an understatement, Shin noticed, however, that despite the craziness that was this guys room, he saw a dozen, freshly sewn, and ironed suits hanging up in the corner. He guessed even the messiest of people would clean up for prom. It was quite obvious that Jerry was pretty sick of Shin at this point, but seeing as he had already agreed to assist Shin, he figured the best, and quickest, thing to do would be to help. "Look man, See! I told you the thing barley works. I can barely get human channels on it. I think if you mess with those antenna's on top, something might happen" Sighing, Shin stood up and grabbed the antennas. They were the 1960's metal antennas that were very popular with the TV sets then. REALLY old school Sh*t. ~What's with this guy and antiques?~ Being careful not to use too much force, Shin began to twist, and fold the antennas randomly. He honestly had no idea what he was doing, and with the lack of success, his patience was dwindling. "Dammit...Piece of-" bending the left antenna all the way down, Shin shook the set with his other hand " Crap!" "Why do you need the human channels anyway?" Jerry sighed, crossing his arms. "I just need to watch the news for a bit. What i want to see may not even be news anymore though.." Shin answered him. "Human news? Oh....I mean..I heard rumors of you and your friends going to the city...and I also heard some crazy sh*t went down... " Not saying anything Sin continued to mess with antennas and shake the TV, but with more force. " I heard you....umm..Well anyway, My girlfriend is one of the student council members, and she told me your brother was pretty pissed..And the headmaster even talked to them about -" Clenching his fist in frustration, Shin figured he'd have to find a Tv elsewhere. Kicking the side of the TV as hard as he could, his foot cracked through the wood and went inside. "Hey Man! what hell are you doing!" Jerry yelled, running forward and placing his hands on his face in disbelief. It was then that the TV went silent, the static had stopped, and was replaced with muffled voices. After pulling his foot out Shin and Jerry squatted down in front of the screen. The volume was low, and the screen was a but blurry, but Shin could make out the voice of a women, who seemed to be talking to some game show host. "Yesss!" Shin shouted with excitement as he began to turn the knob on the Tv. " Hey man, you almost destroyed this Tv! this is my grannys!-..." "Yeah yeah, just a second ago you were busy running your mouth on what a piece of crap it is." As Shin turned the knob, the screen instantaneously switched channels. Some of the channels were definitely clearer than others, and some were color, while others were in black n white. But non-the less, Shin was just satisfied the TV was working. It only took Shin a couple of minutes to find the local news station. A man was reporting on a recent robbery that took place at a local mom and pops shop. "Ah..I know that place.." Shin said more to himself. "Ok...you found the news station, ugh just hurry up man, i got a lot of sewing to do-" ~.It's only been a week....I need to know whats happened..~ As if on cue the reporter placed his hand on the mic on his ear and said "And this just in, I have just gotten word that another body has been found. Police have just discovered the body of a male, police are saying that this could be connected to the bodies that were found last week. The age, and name is still unknown, police will need to conduct further investigation" ~Bodies??~ "Just last week, the body of Drug lord, Tweed was found just a mile away from Warehouse 78. Many others, that were connected to drug lord were found not to far away. It then only a few days later that some of the members of a rival gang were found-" His eyes widening, Shin froze. "......." The screen then switched from the reporter to a grid of mugshots, and pictures of different individuals, that had their names at the listed below. The voice of the reporter could still be heard, listing off the names. His purple eyes jetting from each one, Shin did recognize some of them to be Tweed's, some of the people were even from his own, but wasn't until his eyes landed on the very last mugshot, did he stop breathing. "Ed.." Shin whispered to himself. Looking over at Shin, Jerry cocked his eyebrow " This is what you wanted to see?.....You know any of em?" "....No" Shin answered, standing up. "Thanks..." Standing up, Jerry dusted off his clothes "Hey Blackwing!......." Jerry called out to him But Shin didn't hear him, he continued his way to the door, out the room and down the hall. He had a million things running through his mind, and he felt like he was going to be swept away with sadness, for the thought of Ed being dead was...just unreal... ~What about Sebastian?...Is he dead too?....~ He felt so heavy, as if he was pinned under a giant boulder. He felt so helpless. Everything around him was a blur, his surroundings, the people around him, even the fact that by this time the bell had rung, and people were beginning to make their way to their destinations. ~Ed and the others were killed last week..But if that was the case, Ryu would of told me....So..Someone's picking off my men one by one.. and It's obviously not Tweed....~ By this point Shin had made his way out of the building and down the steps. Things were much worse than what he thought. He could feel the guilt rise in him, he should be there now, not here. What was he even doing? The more he thought about it, the worse he felt. Especially about Ryu, considering he didn't want to go back, and was more interested in the dance. Was he just going to abandon their friends? They needed to talk. Distracted by his thoughts, Shin didn't notice the girl that was charging straight towards him. "HEY! Blackwing!" The girl's screeching immediately pulled Shin from his daze, his eyes immediately landing on her. Before he could respond the girl quickly grabbed his collar and roughly pulled him closer to her face. "Did you not hear me call you?!!" she screamed louder. "What the-" Shin looked down and noticed her badge, which read: 'Student Council Member: Risa Jones' ~Oh Great, it's one of those- Wait, this is that loudmouth girl from the cafeteria!~ "What the hell do you want?" Shin scoffed, pushing the girl back. Taking a deep breath, the girl closed her eyes, in part of her attempt to speak calmly "Seeing as your the only Blackwing I've spotted at this point, I need to find your brother..." "Which one?.." Shin Sighed. "The dumbass one" "I don't know where Kelaras is, probably his history-" "NO-" Risa interrupted "..Not him, the idiot, the one who's unfortunately the president..." Risa seethed, her anger rising again. "Oh.." he definitely wasn't expecting that "Well Last time i saw Kelos, he was at the basketball court-" " OH I KNOW HE WAS THERE, HIM AND HIS IDIOT FRIENDS, ALONG WITH THAT DIMWIT WHITE LOTUS PRACTICALLY DESTROYED THE PLACE! FIRST THE FIGHT IN THE CAFETERIA, THEN THE COURT, AND NOW A BUNCH OF IDIOTS FIGHTING UGHH AND YOUR BROTHER ISN'T DOING HIS JOB!!" By this point a bunch of students were looking in their direction, for Risa's yells were definitely loud enough to be attracting attention. ~What the hell does she want me to do about it?~ "Uh, yeah ok, well it seems that's your problem, if we're done here, Ill just be on my way-" "Look Blackwing..." Risa interrupted. Stepping closer to him, she placed her hands on her hips. "....We seriously don't need anymore trouble. People are already riled up because of prom, I- I mean We as the student council really don't need anything else...especially from you-" He wasn't surprised, of course she must of known something. "...Don't be thinking of doing anything stupid.." Turning on her heels, Risa walked away. It wasn't a moment after when the small girl with curly hair, from before, hovered over to her to hand her a clip board. Immediately Risa screeched. " UGH!!!!! soo much damage, we'll have to hold more fundraisers dammit!" "Uh yes..mam... um..also...One of the guys who was in that fight...was a human- "WHAT?!" Shin turned and looked at them Continuously flinching, the girl continued " Uh yes..well...so I think the teachers may make everyone watch sensitivity and understand videos during gym, on you know...uhh-" "YEAH I know!...on about how to get along with Humans. Sigh Headmaster may even talk with us again, and that fool is just as useless as Kelos..." ~A human?...Could it be-..Nahhh He's not the type....Plus I gotta talk to Ryu...~ Pushing the thought from his mind, Shin figured he make his way back to his room. The building they were at currently was a little ways from the front of the school. "Did he sustain any serious injury? the human" Risa asked. "Um...no..But John-" "John The human?" " Yes the human..he wasn't injured. But all of them are in the detention room..or cell or....." Shin stopped in his tracks and turned and looked at them both again ~John??....~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ The bell definitely caught Kelaras off guard, for him and Lyla were holding onto every word Kade said. Kelaras was only interested because this whole situation was actually quite entertaining. He felt like a matchmaker on a mission, he guessed the events from earlier with a certain someone just got him interested in this whole "Setting my friend up with someone" thing. Plus he didn't mind helping Lyla out, he did kind of owe her. Kelaras and Lyla watched as Kade neatly, and carefully place his belongings in his bag and head to the door. He said goodbye to Mr.Raphael and left the room. Instantly turning to Kelaras, Lyla punched his arm "Oh my gosh Kelaras! I can't believe you did that!" " Haha hey I was just trying to help you out, you'll get nowhere if your quiet all the time" "But he wasn't even interested...He's not dumb, I'm positive he knew it was me......He's probably not interested in such a low leevel demon like me-" "Hey now!-" Kelaras glared at her "Your not a low level demon, Why would say something like that? Your cool, and strong.." Lyla smiled a little. " Ehh and I guess your're kind of cute too" he added making a yuck face. "Haha shut up.." she replied pushing him in the arm. "Haha, Hey I'm sure he thinks your cool. Plus did you hear him at the end, it sounded like he was about to say about prom at the end there." "Yeah you're right..But-" Standing up, Kelaras picked up his paper, "Tell ya what, Later I'm supposed to be meeting someone outside by the oak tree, I think by that time the event should have started. Really it's people selling dorm stuff, but hear there will be live music,more prom stuff, you know the all that stuff. I'll invite him, we meet there, and Bam! there's your chance." "Eh I don't knooo-OK!" Clasping her hands together, the small frown that was on her face transformed into a big smile "Haha alright, I'll see you in a couple of hours Lyla." Picking up his paper and making his way to the door, he looked at Raphael and made his way out the door. Looking down the hallway, he spotted Kade making his way towards the double doors. Maneuvering as swiftly, and quickly as possible he was able to, to get close enough without seeming to creepy. He followed Kade out the doors, and waited a bit for them to be little away from the building. Clearing his throat, Kelaras held up his hand and spoke " Hey man! Hows it going. Thanks for the help earlier. -" Coming to a stop, Kade turned and looked at him. Kelaras couldn't read his expression, he seemed like he was in a trance, or daze or something. "Oh...It's no problem." Turning back around, he kept walking "Yeah, but hey, I was going to say, Me, and few of my friends are going to the event later, I hear it'll be a good time waster. So uhh, I was just extending the invitation, you should come man. There will be live music, people selling stuff, even free food from some of the programs here. If your into that, you should come on out with us." As he Kelaras awaited a response, he looked up at the sky, he always forgot how late in the day it was whenever he got out of his classes. The event was surely going to start soon, he was going to have to get "that," in order to be prepared for what he had in mind for Namine. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ "Sir you have a lot of paperwork to do! Not to mention you must go talk to the students that caused quite a ruckas today! The two boys form the cafeteria, annnd just recently-" Shuffling through the many papers that occupied his hands, he read one that was in the back of the pile " annnd the group of boys who got into it this evening. They've been sent to the detention facility, but there MUST BE REPERCUSSIONS HEADMASTER" The man who was scolding Hucklebee stood very tall, with slicked back, shiny black hair in a ken barbie doll hairstyle. He wore gold spectacles, and a black suit. The man's pristine complexion, starched outfit, and overall demeanor screamed organization, and order. Hucklebee was sitting at his desk, which was completely covered with papers that needed to be signed, orders that needed to be made, and scripts for official announcements he needed to make. With his head face down on his desk, Hucklebee groaned. " I'm soo tired Jameess.." he whined. "YOU'RE Tired? Who's been dealing with all the paperwork you've so graciously bestowed upon me because of your laziness? Sit up!" Hucklebee sat up, but slumped in his seat. "I don't know why you insist of giving those ungrateful hooligans something so foolish as this "Prom." You should be pushing for academics! Plus see how they show you their appreciation? By causing nothing but destruction and chaos, I recently got the damage report from one the student council members, and it's enormous sir-!" " I SEE! James...Really, can you blame them? Being locked up here like an animal in a cage. I don't blame these kids for getting into a tussle every now and then..-" "But Sir!-" James said, trying to object, but Hucklebee held up his hand, and James went silent. Standing up, Hucklebee picked up a gold encrusted pen and a clipboard that had a bunch of papers held in it. Signing the papers he continued " But you are right, there does have to be repercussions, don't worry I'll take care of that. I'll go see those boys and talk to them while they're in the detention facility" With a big grin forming on his face, James straightened up, closed his eyes and nodded. " I also heard one of the boys that was in the fight was a Human. John, and yes, I do mean that John, sir." Looking up at James, Hucklebee placed his hand on his chin, and after a minute, he did nothing but smile. "Ok" He finally answered, with his smile still on his face. Hucklebee always answered with an "Ok," and James could never really tell what he was really thinking when he said it. But after spending centuries serving him, he knew was serious. Placing the clipboard down on his desk, Hucklebee raised his arms and stretched "ehh I'm so stiff, James, please run me a bath, I think I''ll take a nice soak before I go see the boys" "Of course sir, Good idea, It's good that you're also thinking about presenting a nice, clean image to the new student once he gets here. I'm also very proud of you for planning your tour for him once he arrives" Hucklebee froze. ~New student? What new Student???.....~ His eyes quickly flashed to the trash can, where he had secretly thrown away a bunch of papers James had given him a few weeks before, some he was sure was information on the new student. ~Oh.....~ Clearing his throat, Hucklebee began to rub the back of his head "Uh, haha Why yes, the new student! Yes the New student that is coming, Today! Of course I was thinking about him.. Tour?? Oh yes! Tour! eh haha" His eyebrow twitching James crossed his arms "...You have no idea what I'm talking about do you?.." "Ehhh, ha..well" "SIR THE NEW STUDENT WILL BE HERE AT ANY MOMENT!? HOW HAVE YOU NOT PREPARED!!" James yelled with spit flying out "EHH i FORGOT! BUT HEY, I DID TAKE IMPROVISATION IN YEARS AGO, SO IT'LL BE OK! ITS NO BIGGIE JAMES" Hucklebee yelled back. ~!Knock Knock Knock!~ "AH he's here." Hucklebee squeaked. Sighing, James straightened his tie. "Why isn't Laem escorting him in?" "Oh, I sent Laem on a food run right quick. I wanted something fast and greasy from the cafeteria, not from the kitchen." James glared at him "He's your body guard, we have a chef for all the teachers and your needs. Anyway, the boy's name is Kuno Ranner, Human for the most part, teleportation, interesting kid." Walking over towards the door, he placed his hand on the doorknob, but looked back one more time at Hucklebee to signal for him to get ready. It wasn't until he did this that he noticed just how ridiculous Hucklebee looked, and how messy, and unorganized looking his office looked. He was still wearing his purple, shiny, jewel encrusted leotard, his white hair was all over the place and he had huge bags under his eyes. The marble floor could barley be seen for unsigned, and red stamped documents were everywhere. His desk mimicked a full dumpster, and Hucklebee's many leotards, capes, and shoes were falling out of his nearby closet. The gold lamps, huge velvet curtains the were drawn over the windows, and other fascinating elements of his office were completely smothered by the papers everywhere. Sighing, James opened the door, and immediately Kuno was met with such heat, James could see immediately the sweat began to form on his forehead. ~This boy won't be able to stay in here too long~ "Why hello there Kuno Ranner, and welcome to the Glass Academy." James greeted, bowing.Ushering Kuno in, He saw how Kuno took in the scene, he wouldn't be surprised if the kid was absolutely down fallen. " And this Kuno, is your headmaster, Headmaster Hucklebee." Hucklebee held up his hand and waved at him. "WHY HELLLLOOOO THERE MR.KUNO..ERRR" "Ranner." James said. " RANNER!-" Hucklebee continued "AND WELCOME TO GLASS ACADEMY, WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU!" " Uh, why thank you um Ugh" Kuno then begin to cover his mouth, and cough. The heat in the room was causing the air in the room to thin out, and make Kuno pour with sweat. "Sir.." James said to get Hucklebee's attention. he then nodded his head at Kuno. "OH Right! I'm so sorry Kuno for the heat in here!" hurrying to his desk, Hucklebee opened a drawer and pulled out a small jewelry box. Taking out a gold key from the other drawer, he unlocked it and pulled out several rings. Placing a ring on each ringer on his left hand, the heat in the room seem to immediately dissipate. After a minute the temperature of the room had gone down significantly, but it was still remained pretty warm. Kuno had stopped coughing, and was able to breath regularly again Scurrying back over to Kuno, Hucklebee grabbed Kuno's hand and smiled "Are you ok dear? Sorry about that. You know you've come at a great time, in your tour, I was about to head to one of the main buildings and have a talk with a few students, and I'll be able to introduce after I'm done talking to them." Leading Kuno out the door, James went to the trash can and scuffled around for the documents on Kuno. After retrieving them, he followed behind Kuno, closing the door to Hucklebee's office, and locking it. Walking down the hallway with Hucklebee leading, Kuno in the middle, and James following behind, Hucklebee begin to explain to Kuno how night, and day classes work, lunch times, and the many rules of the school. But it didn't take long for him to reach his favorite subject.Prom. "Prom is in about two weeks actually! As you can see by looking at all the paraphernalia on the walls, the students are really getting into the spirit of it! It makes me so excited!" Hucklebee clasped his hands together, and sighed. James rolled his eye ~ I wonder if this kid is as interested in this as he is is. He probably thinks were both two unprofessional s. Looking up, James looked behind, and then glanced up forward. ~Seems we have someone watching us..~ James opened his mouth to say something but was interrupted by Hucklebee first "You can come on out dear! We don't bite! You should join us too, we're about to head over to the detention facility! Plus we have a brand new student!" Hucklebee, and James didn't slow down their pace, for they assumed the student was going to come out and follow them. 

 Darris Darris was sitting in the chair, shaking his hand slightly. Even though he caught the large boys punch, even without his powers, that punch was pretty hard. Looking around, everyone sat in silence, even with the makeshift truce between both sides of the fight that supposedly both of them had been a part of, it was still pretty silent. One of the boys approached him and smiled, inquiring as to how Darris had wound up in such a place as a detention facility. Darris smiled back and took a breath. "Excellent question young fidget. how I got in here was easy. I was escorted by a gentleman. A rather large gentleman I might add. As for why I am in here, I can only deduce that it has something to do with me not being a part of this world, but you would not know anything about that." said Darris. He leaned back int eh chair and stretched out his back. "I can guess well enough that this is a detention room for trouble makers. Which I can also guess because you lot seem tense when you first arrived. A fight, correct? Why are you getting into fights. I can't tell much, but you and the other look like you are pretty decent lads. And I have known John for a short while." Darris stood up and lifted his hand into the air. He held it for a second as though he was expecting something. He brought it back down. "Well, it didn't hurt to try again." he said more to himself than Fallen. "So, are you another one of Johns friends? ally? acquaintance?" Laundry Room Gang As Aleth suggested that they just quit and get alone, the orc man (Gavin) scoffed. Even though some of his "friends" were nodding in agreement, barely making a sound, Gavin spun to face the others. It seemed that everyone had already accepted this plan, as Fallen was speaking to the man in the back, and Darrel was folding wrinkled piece of paper. No longer give a s*** Gavin hopped down and kicked he wall before leaning against it. Darrel, looked over at him and looked away. Shorty and Makray sort of remained with Gavin because that is where they felt they belonged, at least with this group of people. And so they all sat waiting for someone to come back and issue a punishment to something. The room was just to boring. Memphis Memphis was in his class for the day. He looked outside as the sun was lowering. Looking back up at the board for began to feel nervous. Something he rarely ever felt. He could guess why he felt this way, but he could not convince himself that this was the reason. He knew it must be, but it felt so unnatural to him. As time went by, and the thought remained in his head, he finally was convinced that this was the reason he felt this way. He was going to do something he has not really done before. And when he thought about it, he concluded that this was significantly less daring than what he had done over a week ago. He even knew the feelings of the other. Such a step, Memphis supposed that others might of felt this way, but Memphis was still confused by it. Clearing his head he focused back onto the board and what the teacher was saying. Elise Elise's eyes opened slowly as she stared at the ceiling. She closed them again and turned over, hitting the foot of the bed. After lunch she went back to her dorm to get some more sleep before her own classes later in the evening. She must of fallen off the bed and rolled around the floor because her bedding was everywhere. Standing up Elise felt like she did just hours ago. Tired. Yawning, she opened her window and looked out. The sun was low in the sky, but it was still plenty bright out. She took a look at her clock. She wouldn't have class until several hours later. That is if she chose to attend them. She would sometimes skip, but no one really ever noticed when she did, which she rather liked. She was already dressed from lunch, but was in a mess, the clothes were all bunched up, but she straightened them out before leaving her dorm once again. She left the dorm building and wandered around finding another. Wandering the halls of that new class building she passed by the library. Out of curiosity, she peered inside and found the stack of books that Memphis usually is found reading. It was a medium sized pile. She walked over. Taking a seat in the chair, she grabbed the firs book from the top and opened it, a book mark fell out onto the floor. Elise reached down and grabbed it, but forgot where in the book it was located, so she ended up sticking it in a random place. She grabbed the next book and opened it and began to read some of the words in it. She turned the book sideways, because she did not understand a single thing it was saying. Something about moving dust bunnies that could teleport and made up the universe. How do dust bunnies makes up everything? A librarian walked around the corner, but this surprised Elise enough to quickly shut the book and hid under the table. One could guess that she was afraid Memphis would catch her. But after taking a thought about the silliness of it, Elise climbed out and dusted herself off before promptly leaving the library and making her way out to the courtyard. 
  Spoiler 
 There was a scrambling of papers and excited mumbles from inside the office as whatever entropic beast within began to stir. Within moments of the knocking, the door was open, and out popped the likes of some mad scientist and his deranged assistant, along with a stifling breeze of warmth that could only be described as the waft of heat one receives upon opening an oven too quick. Even the girl in hiding could feel it - a girl who was then indirectly introduced to the new boy as office’s assistant, ‘James’, announced him to be a Mister ‘Kuno Ranner’. The man behind the orderly and methodical James, bright-eyed and shaggy-haired, was no doubt his infamously disorganized counterpart: Headmaster Hucklebee. Although he was an absolute mess and looked like he hadn’t slept in a fortnight, the headmaster was hardly willing to let these setbacks stymie his enthusiasm, as the man shouted his welcome to the boy with the utmost of zest: “WHY HELLLOOOOO THERE MISTER KUNO… err…-” His slightly grating voice was cut off by the gentle click of the door as it shut, and Caedis, like a curious wraith, emerged from hiding in order to place a curious ear upon the wood. “-RANNER!” Caedis caught Hucklebee’s embarrassment mid-word. “AND WELCOME TO GLASS ACADEMY, WE’VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU!” Caedis heard only coughing, some mumbles, and an air of slight discomfort. She leaned into the door a little more. “Sir…” James, no doubt, murmured. “OH RIGHT!” Caedis almost reeled from the sudden spike in volume, and she silently gritted her teeth at the annoyance. A mental litany of curses ran through her head as the man continued. “I’m so sorry Kuno for the heat in here!” There was a fumbling of drawers and the rustle of loose objects, followed by a moment of silence. After a while, the coughing had finally ground to a halt, so no doubt Hucklebee had done something about the stuffy and unpleasant air inside. Perhaps he finally discovered the thermostat… Caedis was, quite frankly, disappointed by what she was hearing. There was absolutely nothing, as the kids would call it, “juicy” about this conversation. The girl’s attention soon began to wane as she began to think of other things, such as field mice and old television shows: things that never failed to entertain. “Sorry about that,” Hucklebee finally apologized. “You know, you’ve come at a great time. In your tour, I was about to-” It was then that Caedis finally stopped listening entirely. She yawned silently as she lifted her head from the door, letting her saurian tongue roll out and taste the air before pulling itself back behind her teeth. Caedis couldn’t help but feel a certain sense of mild dejection - she didn’t like to eavesdrop when it meant that she wouldn’t learn anything interesting. It was then that she heard the sound of approaching footsteps, and, intuitively, she darted back into hiding just before the office door swung open to reveal a merry group of sweat-drenched three. Caedis didn’t need her skills in detecting scent to catch wind of the smell of perspiration, and she wrinkled her nose at the light aroma. They walked, and Caedis followed at a distance, resuming her game. “Prom is in two weeks actually!” Hucklebee announced proudly as they strolled down the corridor with their distant shadow, his tone as wild and excited as the hair upon his head. “As you can see by looking at all the paraphernalia on the walls, the students are really getting into the spirit of it! It makes me so excited!” He clasped his hands together like an innocent schoolgirl, whilst his assistant, clearly unamused, gave a sarcastic roll of the eyes. Prom. Caedis grimaced at the word. Never before had she been to a prom, and never before had she asked or been asked by anyone about it. The rather intangible term made her stomach churn, and all Caedis could picture it as was a sweaty room full of hormone-pumped teenagers acting like a flock of peacocks eager to mate. She hated to imagine what that many kids in one place would do, not to mention the smells. She figured that the best thing to do would be to put it out of her mind, and so she did, grudgingly. At that moment, James glanced up towards the ceiling, then back behind them towards Caedis’ general location. Caedis winced; she knew she couldn’t hide from those two. “You can come on out, dear!” Hucklebee called, surprising the lot of them. “We won’t bite! You should join us too, we’re about to head over to the detention facility! Plus we have a brand new student!” Caedis gave a discreet groan to herself before she stepped out of the shadows like a shark from the depths. She turned and walked towards her brisk beckoners, casting her emerald eyes towards them as she held a polite smile with only a hint of mischief. Additionally, and for the first time today, Caedis had removed her concealing hood, her radiantly white skin and hair finally exposed to the artificial wash of light within the hallway. She wasn’t white as in the human pale, but rather white in the way of the complete absence of color. Her dermis, although eerily devoid of the naturality of common blemishes, had none of the healthy glow of most mortal beings, and it was subdued and ghost-like, as if it’s glory days had passed and it no longer wanted to be seen. Despite these features, and if it weren’t for the striking oddness of her winding plethora of tattoos and corpse-white skin and hair, she might have been described as pretty - and maybe cute to anyone audacious enough to say it. Although it was hard to make that judgement through the stare of predatory eyes and the menace of serpent’s teeth. A dark-rimmed stare that set itself upon each man before her as she spoke. “Headmaster. James.” She greeted civilly as gave each a respective nod, her voice lastly landing on Kuno with a small smirk. “Kuno.” 
 Fallen "...escorted by a gentleman. A rather large gentleman I might add." Staring at the pearly white wall, Fallen continued to listen to what Darris's reply was. Something about a large man sort of clicked into his mind. This blueish silvered haired man seem to appear right around as the time as the new headmaster, which was a large character and not to mention a really loud voice that was irritating as hell, "As for why I am in here, I can only deduce that it has something to do with me not being a part of this world," grasping full attention from Fallen, Darris was obviously now not a normal being that had come into Glass. ~..not from this world, who the heck is this man?~ His diamond shaded eyes hovered towards Darris, on the side of his eye Fallen felt a tense sort of shiver stick into the tips of his shoulders. Thoughts of not knowing about something that may or not be important was a bit of a bother, very difficult to take charge of and react to. "Seems like you arrived recently, you know... I wonder why you are watching over a human," intervening, Aleth seemed to be overhearing the conversation. John... John, was a human wasn't he? Fallen didn't really get involved with humans but guess he ran himself into one now. Then again, he didn't exactly seem like the most normal one either. Something special possibly.. Pulling back into focus, Darris seemed to be speaking again to Fallen and possibly Aleth, " ..seem tense when you first arrived. A fight, correct? Why are you getting into fights. I can't tell much, but you and the other look like you are pretty decent lads." Maybe Aleth was the decent lad, Fallen wasn't exactly the most innocent one in the days of living. The connection between this man and John must be very strong, not many adults would take them time to go to school to watch over one of their friends, seems like a lot of time that would be wasted and slightly boring. Surely this guy has already went through the whole school process, what would actually convince him to take a step back into the drama filled hallways of another or possibly the same one. "Was just trying to help someone who looked like they needed a little help..." thinking back to how the fight began for Fallen and Aleth when they butted into what was not any of their business, he knew then that there was more to why at least him himself had jumped into the brawl. Coughing, Fallen nodded and mischievously smiled slouching his body forward in his chair, "Needed to take a breath... to feel a bit more in reality again. Drifting away... felt like I wasn't going to enter back into the real world until I swung this fist" lifting his right hand into the air in front of his face, Fallen laughed and shook his head. He sounded like some poet, but that really was the only way he could think of to describe why he had joined the fight besides trying to help John out. Fallen had spent so much time lately worrying about Cate that it didn't seem as if he had his mind in the right place sort of like a little spell. Darris was now lifting his hand up into the air right in front of him. First, Fallen thought that the man was mocking him. Then again he did not seem like the sort to really make fun of anyone, he gave of a vibe that seemed mature, the little kid that could have been once in him didn't seem to exist anymore. The mans eyes looked at his hand as if they were going to stab right through, what was he waiting for... didn't look like there was anything on their hand really. "So, are you another one of Johns friends? ally? acquaintance?" Biting the inside of his cheek scraping a bit of the saliva sticking to the outer layer of the skin in dragging onto his teeth and then swallowing it. John was more of a stranger to both Fallen and Aleth, so it was a tad difficult yo choose either of them. "I guess sort of like an acquaintance but it is a little hard to explain, haven't really had much of a chance to talk that much." At least going by his answer, the two of them were closer to the human than any of the other idiots that decided to run after John. Then again, they didn't exactly know what had started the fight but then again, did it really matter at this point. The court yard was partially destroyed, they had their fun, and here they were now having "the time of day" sitting around in a white room that appeared to be similar to a room for those who are labeled insane. So in relation to Darris's question, what did John really mean to this man? Was he his little brother, they didn't exactly look alike... well not really at all but no one can be exactly fully sure about physical appearances . it is in the blood, but still Fallen doubted it. "I wonder old man, what exactly does a watching over John have to do with you?" Laying his hands gently down against the top, pushing his body up from the hard white marble chair, Fallen looked over and faced Darris to make eye contact, "I mean, I honestly if had the opportunity to visit some academy after graduating or even dropping out which I doubt you would have done, would never take on the chance to poke the tip of my fingernail into the door of a school unless I absolutely have to.." Taking a step forward Fallen shook his head, he knew he was getting into this strangers buisness a bit too much and did not have much room but at least he let the man know what he was thinking, "You don't have to answer unless you have to, just let that run through your head please, " Looking around the room, everyone else's faced appeared to be a bit bored. Seemed as if Aleth's suggestion had worked out, no one was bickering with one another and it was pretty much peaceful now which could also drive them each insane. "Interesting..." Sarcastically speaking, the dwarf boy seemed to almost be losing it. There was nothing to do in this room, they all basically made up so what else did they want? They could all pitch and help pay for repairs of everything that was damaged in the court yard. Glancing over towards the electric boy, he seemed to just be poking his index finger again the table tops, if that was the most entertaining thing then great, better than really nothing at all, Humming to himself, Through Glass, Fallen tried to keep himself occupied. They were all doing their own thing.. Time seemed to be passing by slowly but they were sure that it was actually moving, they were not going to be stuck inside this dreaded room forever... Namine Tapping her number two mechanical lead pencil against the desk to make an echo run a crossed the room, Namine kept notice of each second that the clock hit. Seemed as if the last ten or fifteen minutes of class were the longest, the most boring since they were usually not doing much work. They took as much time as possible to do their assignments but the teachers more expected the students to do their work with each other or independently, they didn't speak much themselves. At least not any of the teachers for Namine's current class that she was in. The beat of her pencil seemed to catch a few small attention spans of other students sitting among the classroom wood desks. The rest were either not fully finished working or they were just not give two craps about what else was going on besides on how they clearly wanted to rush out of this class and have some sort of break, heading on to their next piece of the Academy. To be fully honest to herself, Namine was a bit nervous. The whole class time she tried to focus on her assignment but she was not exactly fully sure of what was going to happen after the block. With Kelaras wishing to meet her by the tree that she agreed to meet him up at. Lately throughout that past couple days he had been acting a bit more odd than usual around her and the others. A bit unsure of himself maybe, but Namine didn't want to get to involved in his emotions if she didn't have any place in them... at least not that she knew of. Normally, she did not get so worked up about a guy but now... she actually found someone that could make an actually smile form onto her face, it had been a long time since she was able to. Yet, she still didn't give two sh*ts about many other people, staring at them bluntly they all seemed like some other worthless puzzle pieces, the blue sky pieces that you put together, they are easy to see what they are but you don't know where they go nor do you really care, you just want to see the full picture and pick of the important pieces, the ones that show the meaning of the story behind them. Suddenly the bell went of, slightly shaking the hearing of Namine's ears. Students swiped their bags off from their desk, throwing them over their shoulders and grasping onto the straps to pull them close like leaches sucking off energy at each step taken. Namine's friend, Daniella swiped her books off from her desk and elbowed Namine lightly in her left arm jokenly, probably to pull Namine back into focus Namine could not take her eyes off the time to the point where she was not fully aware of what she was really gazing at or where she was. "Greetings little miss, you still in this world?" Nodding in response Namine looked up to the brunette girl standing above her now. "Slowly slipping into the next dimension, going to leave you behind in this hell hole of a classroom, sounds like the perfect plan right?" Stepping out from her seat, Namine felt her hair tug, twisting her head a bit, her piece of her released from the not in the nut of the chair in the back that she was sitting in. She was still not fully used to her long hair after going from medium length from near a month or whatever earlier. Laughing at Namine, Daniella shook her head, "Sure, looks like your the one being forced to stay here, I hope you enjoy every extra second," Both waving goodbye to their teacher they felt the relief rush through them. That was their last class of the day thankfully at least for the both of them. Some other students seemed to have a couple more classes about two or two and a half. Sighing, Namine let all the hot air built up within her lungs out. Finally she didn't have to write anymore notes, it was starting to get really tiring, ~They all seemed were pointless notes... doubt these are going to be on the assessment~. Bodies would push against one another in the hall, every time someone would get closer to Namine and her friend, they would rush up a bit faster so that their was no contact with some creepy strangers body. Making their ways through the halls, all they could hear now was comments about class and of course the prom that was coming up. Daniella was going with her boyfriend, Chester, who she had been dating for at least two years not or at least the was that long that Namine had believed. For the past week, Namine had to listen to Daniella continue to bug her to convince her into attending the dance. Though, at this point it wasn't exactly a possibility but it wasn't a shot down either. Going along not only would look sort of bad but also would feel weird. ~Already feels a bit awkward looking at all of these couples throwing their bodies over top of each other throughout the halls or even the sidewalks outside..~ It could have been jealousy but not fully sure, yeah she could go in a group like what was suggested at lunch but... would that fully fix everything with feelings of not having a date or not... could never be fully sure of what all was to happen. Once both Namine and Daniella started to reach the door, this was where they were to make their separate ways. Namine figured it would probably be better to have her and Kelaras left alone, and she probably didn't want to have her friend listening into a conversation that Namine was exactly sure of what was going to happen either to have her there for it. "Hey, I will catch up with you later on, I gotta meet up with someone alright?" Daniella's expression changed from sort of bored to a bit excited, "Can I come? I want to know who!" "No. Go away, do not follow me or I will throw you into a vault and never let you out." "Awe, c'mon Namine. I won't.." "Go away, now please," Basically biting off Daniella's head, Namine just began to make her way. Listening to her friends laugh as she began to walk away agreeing to not having to get involved in the situation. Walking towards the tree, Namine took a couple deep breathes. ~I guess I am a bit more nervous about meeting up with him than I thought I was~ Since when was it normal for her to meet up with people? With most, she would just avoid them and not have to deal with any drama or pointless conversations. It was getting a bit dark out as Namines hair began to shine brighter since it broke away the darkness and shined white making it know she was still standing. Looking around she finally made it up around where they were aranged to meet, she looked around and took a couple breathes nodding to herself. Waiting and still treding through the dark green grass...

 John's mood changed again. From steaming mad, now to calm and level headed. He was unsure of why his mood changed so drastically, especially because his circumstances where now worse than before. John noticed the big one attempt to pick up a chair. When it wouldn't budge, he then threw a punch, directed at John. As the orc-boy threw a sucker punch at him, he didn't move; not even a flinch. Fallen, Aleth and Darris all stepped in to help, but Darris was the one who actually blocked the punch. It's good to know I have allies. John thought to himself. After an exchanging of words, Orc-boy and the short one sat down. John's mind began to wander as Fallen and Darris began to speak. His thoughts went to thinking about what to do in the event he were to get out of the detention facility. Do I go back to my room? Do I try to find Shin or Ryu? John thought and weighed his options. Neither of which seemed too fun. [i]If I go find Shin, I'll probably get scolded, but if I go to my room, I won't have anything to do..... I don't know my way around campus, either, so finding something else to do is pretty much out of the question. John finally snapped out of his daze when Fallen spoke, saying, "I wonder old man, what exactly does a watching over John have to do with you?" The question made John ask the same thing in his head. Why does he watch over me? What does he care? John nearly spoke, asking the same question when he heard a bang behind him. Quickly turning, he noticed shorty had just slammed his head on the desk out of boredom. "Interesting" He muttered sarcastically. John looked around and noticed everyone was dying of boredom. He, too, was quite bored. "Does anyone know what we're actually waiting for?" John asked after a small moment of silence. 
 Muffled yelling could be heard from inside the headmaster's office. Standing in front of the massive solid wooden door, was a rather short boy by the name of Kuno Ranner, a recent transfer student; the boy leaned slightly onto his medium-sized travel bag, slowly observing the sculpting on the wooden door, then sighed slightly from boredom. "What's taking them so long?" The boy thought to himself, usually his headmasters regarded him with furious speed and apocalyptic anger from all the troubles he causes, but here... Nothing. "I guess I do need some time adjusting to the new place." Then the door swung open. Tipping Kuno off of his balance from his travel bag, nearly made him slip and fall. A wave of heat then suddenly met the boy's face, so he quickly covered up his face, it felt like he was standing right in front of a burning stove, as sweat begun to emerge from his forehead. "Geeeeez...!" Before he could speak, a calm voice interrupted him, from the direction of the formally dressed man who opened the door for him: "Why hello there Kuno Ranner, and welcome to the Glass Academy." Kuno was then rushed into the principal's office, and oh the mess. The once noticebly magnificent room was now covered with paper everywhere, it was horrifically unorganized and messy. The boy then took a good look at his principal, a seemingly humble old man, who had the word 'mess' written all over him, behind a desk (if you could call it that) which looks rather like a battlefield of books and writing tools. Kuno was kind of hoping the properly dressed man would be his principal, but since the messy old man who was sporting a flashy leotard was revealed to be his new principal, he could only drop the idea. It didn't take the boy a long time to notice his surrounding with unbarable heat, but his thoughts were once again interrupted, this time by both his headmaster and the esteemed young man. "And this Kuno, is your headmaster, Headmaster Hucklebee," the man said. "Why Helllloooo there Mr.Kuno.. Errr..." the headmaster continued, but clearly was unable to finish. "Ranner," the man prompted confidently, clearly had done his homework. "Ranner! And welcome to Glass Academy, we've been waiting for you!" The headmaster rambled. "Just great..." Kuno thought, "what I needed was exactly this kind of headmaster, not even knowing a new transfer student's name..." then he found out his sarcasm level was starting to rise, so the boy attended to the more immediate situations, "uh, why, thank you um... Ugh..." before the words could even extract from Kuno's lips, he breathed such a massive amount of heat, his lungs forced out a weak cough, covering his mouth, he was getting a little bit dizzy. "Sir..." The well-dressed man seemed to have given the good ol' headmaster a tip with a word. "Oh right! I'm so sorry Kuno, for the heat in here!" Said the headmaster, with a much needed attention to the temperature, and he jumped right into the action, taking strange rings from his drawers, he seemed to have magically decreased the temperature and pressure inside the "sauna room". As the room started be getting rid of its unbarable heat, Kuno got his mind together, and boy was that a hard task. Difficult as it was to calm down, Kuno managed it, but his calmness will not last for long, as Hucklebee then scurried towards him with a peculiar walking style, and grabbed the boy's hand, "are you ok dear? Sorry about that. You know you've come at a great time, in your tour, I was about to head to one of the main buildings and have a talk with a few students, and I'll be able to introduce after I'm done talking to them." Realising how embarassing this was, to be holding hands with a man who smelled like gym sweat, Kuno started to blush, his focus could not be shifted from the hands; looking down at them, Kuno saw how small his hands were compared to Hucklebee's... Then remembered that's not the point. Just when the transfer student decided to jerk his hands back to himself, he felt a force pulling them towards the exact opposite direction; His headmaster brought him out of the big dumpster of a room, and started to ramble on about the all the informations of the Academy, which Kuno had already read about in his handy-dandy Glass Academy student booklet. The door to the headmaster's office was then shut behind them by the well-dressed man, Kuno was quite curious about him, really, since he didn't even know his name. "... prom is in about two weeks actually! As you can see by looking at all the paraphernalia on the walls, the students are really getting into the spirit of it! It makes me so excited!" After Kuno's headmaster returned his hands to him, Hucklebee continued rambling on, and that was the only sentence in the ten million Hucklebee had said that caught his attention. Kuno had never officially see prom, only gotten bits and glimpses of how it would look like in some old movies, the boy also thinks he could dance, no problem, since he has seen Saturday Night Fever, after all. "You can come on out dear! We don't bite! You should join us too, we're about to head over to the detention facility! Plus we have a brand new student!" Hucklebee once again, broke Kuno's train of thought completely, it seems to be the headmaster's job now, destroying thoughts. Kuno couldn't help but to be curious, about who could they talk about... And how do they even know if someone is hiding? "Guess you can't tell how someone is by their looks..." The boy then rambled to himself. A girly groan was heard, then Kuno froze at what he saw, as the shadow stepped into the bright lights of the glossy hallways. A slim girl popped up with a rather cute sneer, Kuno studied her intensively, her body was fairly pale, perhaps the most pale he has seen; Albino was a word that hit his mind, just before he felt her tattoos giving him an eerie feeling, he suddenly got goosebumps as a sudden chill went down his back. Her frail looks though, gave the boy deep curiousity about how her came to be, and what could her power be. As she spoke with her gentle voice, Kuno noticed her sharp teeth and peculiar tongue shape. "Headmaster. James," the girl spoke with such sweetness, nodding as she spelled out each syllable, "Kuno." Noticing her smirk, but zoned out entirely on her body, Kuno came to his senses perhaps a bit later than he would have preferred, making him look blunt, "huh... Ah! Umm... Hi! How do you do? What's your name?" 
​
 A few feet away ayoung girl stood leaning against a wall watch as this all unfolded. Itfascinated her just how different people interacted and how they all seemed socomfortable with each other. She decided to watch some more before startingthat she was a new freshman and had no clue where she was meant to be. As shewatch the small group of people chatting and getting to know each other shefiddled with her thigh sheath which held her most prised item. A small slimknife about the size of her hand. The detail on the handle showed an angel onone side with a small red jewel just above its head and one the other side wasa demon like creature with a small brown jewel also above its head. She removedher throwing knife and started to twirl it around in her right hand with skill.She watch as the convocation seemed to be getting interesting as a girlappeared and joined the others. She guessed that one of the must be theheadmaster from the way this man was dressed. Lee shifted in her position upagainst the wall and by doing so she knocked her small orange bag over, luckilyit was mostly zipped up and the only thing to role out was an apple she hadpicked up earlier that day. " I wonderwhere I'm meant to be? Should I bother them to ask ?" she wondered outloud. It had been her plan to ask but now she was not so sure as the idea oftalking to a group of people made her a little nervous and started thebutterflies flying around her stomach. "I guess illjust wait her a while and see if one f them leaves, maybe I could catch them onthere way out ?" she wondered out loud again. She paused twirling herthrowing knife and straightened her red singlet top and pulled up her blackknee high socks. Finally resumed her pose leaning on the wall , she brushed alock of red hair out of her left eye and the resumed her knife twirling. 
 Elizabeth Elise was walking out into the large courtyard, barely paying attention too anything before she ended up bumping into someone causing her to fall backwards. "Hey!" she complained, somewhat pained as she sat on the ground. The person she had collided with turned to see who hit him. "Watch where you're going." he said smugly before turned back around. Elise stood up rather annoyed and angry with the boys attitude. "Why don't you watch it?" she countered before giving him a shove. The boy staggered and then turned again about to hit her when his hand stopped mid-flight. "No fighting." The boy was frozen in place, or so it appeared as he didn't seem capable of moving from his current pose. "That is quite enough fighting for one day." A tall man in a lab coat walked up to the pair. "Don't you kids have class?" "I have evening classes." said the boy in a sudden change of tone. The teacher looked at him skeptically then turned to Elise. "I don't have a class until tonight either." she quickly said. Someone called from behind and the teacher turned. He looked back at the pair quickly "Just stay out of trouble." He left them to attend to whatever was happening within the small crowd of people. Elise looked back at the boy and smiled mockingly. Even though the teacher left, he seemed to have forgotten to let the boy go. He was still stuck his hand in the air, and Elise took the time to mess with him. "I'm going to get you for this." he complained, as Elise continued to poke at his nose. "Right. How is that working." Elise taunted. She was having too much fun with this. 
  Spoiler 
 As Victoria stormed off away from the mummy-like figure she had recently exchanged un-pleasantries with, her thoughts began to swirl. She now had a secondary objective to finding John. Why stop at one? Her intent at The Glass Academy was to find John and make his life miserable before killing him, but now, Caedis was on that list, too. A tall, lanky looking student, carrying a large stack of books, was unfortunately in her path. The books were stacked so high, he could not see over the top of them, obstructing his view. This boy had the misfortune of being in the same path as Victoria. Smiling, Victoria bumped into the book-carrying boy, causing him to fall over. As he fell, the books flew outward and upward. He landed with a loud thud. Victoria just kept walking, but made sure to step on a few of the books that were now all across the ground. A small smirk appeared on her face. She was pleased with herself. A few of the surrounding students were muttering under her breath about her. "Wow, she's a real b*tch!" one said. "Yeah. Who is she anyways? I've never seen her around before." someone responded. 
 Allowing the two to briefly introduce each other, Hucklebee and James had stopped walking, and were having a small, brief chat of their own. "And what exactly do you tend to do in terms of punishment headmaster? Destruction of school property, and fighting has become quite the trend as of late. If you want the students to take you seriously, and respect you-" Hucklebee groaned internally. He could tell that if he didn't say something now, this was going to lead into a lecture that may continue for the next few hours. "Ah well-" Hucklebee interrupted. James stopped, mouth still open, and his his finger up, to add emphasis to whatever he was saying, put his hand down, and adjusted his glasses. "Well??" James ushered him on. "Well..-" Hucklebee placed a hand on his chin, and thought for a moment. Turning around, James saw that the two young ones had finished their conversation, and were now looking upon them, in confusion. "I've thought of something.." Hucklebee finally answered, his sentence trailing off, as if he really hadn't. Putting his hand back down, Hucklebee noticed the student's gazes. "Heh Heh, let's continue shall we?" As the group moved forward, Hucklebee continued to point out the different "hang-out" spots to Kuno and Caedis. Getting in between them,he leaned forward and pointed towards a fountain they were passing. Decked in the middle of the fountain were three stone angels, that looked like small children, that seemed to be dancing with water shooting up all around them. Nudging both of them, Hucklebee whispered "He he I've heard that Angel Fountain is rumored to be the place where lots of make out sessions happen! he he-" Trailing off Hucklebee dropped his head as if he was suddenly down "-..oh but gee willykers, I guess if you don't have a girlfriend or boyfriend, it's useless right? *SIGH* Oh to be single can be so lonely, am i right kids?" "S-Sir!-" James blurted out, his face turning a little red "That is completely inappropriate!" Eyeing Kuno and Caedis, he couldn't really read their expressions. Looking up at James, Hucklebee Grinned" Just joking James hehe." Speeding up his pace, he resumed his position next to James. Giving Hucklebee a final glare, James cleared his throat. Adjusting his glasses, James looked up and his eyes immediately sparkled."What these two should really know is our wonderful!-" James pointed ahead. There in the distance stood a huge building,with a sign in front reading " Willis Library" Quickly sliding in between Kuno and Caedis, James smiled and placed a hand over his heart "I'm so proud of our library. Housing over two hundred and fifty thousand types of books, it's sure to satisfy even those with the most peculiar of tastes!-" Rubbing his eye,Hucklebee yawned. "-Not to mention since it allows twenty-four access, it is kept constantly clean, and the temperature is constantly regulated, by moi of course! It's so beautiful, and not to mention once you go inside, you'll be awed at how beautifully spaced the bookshelves are, so there is never anyone in your personal space! A good thing, since you should be studying after all!" Turning to face the kids, he realized they weren't there. Looking ahead, he saw that Hucklebee was a few meters ahead pointing out the more social spots. "You don't wanna know about any old boring library do ya? NO? I thought so!" Ushering the kids faster Hucklebee continued forward. Clenching his teeth, James hurried after them, "why you! Sir!" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In the midst of their conversations, the door to the detention room slowly opened. In stepped three individuals, one was a small, but familiar girl, whose badge read "Student Council member: Risa Jones. She earlier had to attend to the fight that happened in the cafeteria. She had her arms crossed, her face was red, more than likely from anger, but her mouth was clenched shut. There was another small girl, with curly hair, hovering beside her holding a clipboard. The third person was a man, that was much older looking, obviously one of the teachers. He was wearing a black shirt, with black sweatpants, with a whistle hanging from around his neck. He was more than likely one of the coaches at the school. Everyone stared at the three, and the three of them stared back. Silence. It wasn't long when one of the boys raised their hand, and without permission,spoke "Um when are we getting outta-" Interrupting him almost immediately Risa yelled "QUIET YOU WORM!" The curly haired girl next to her flinched at her sudden outburst. Her voice definitely didn't match her appearance, and with the shocked look that was now plastered on the Orc boy's face, Risa was happy this had an effect. Sighing, the coach shook his head. Taking the clipboard, Risa began to scan over the paper. The coach looking at Risa sighed. In the most monotone voice imaginable the man spoke " I'm sure you boys know why you're in here. Fighting, although is expected, is completely unacceptable. A proper punishment will be held for all of you. Now in terms of what that punishment is, I have no idea what that will be. The headmaster is on his way to properly assign that to you all. Mrs. Jones and Mrs.Newton will pass out to you a few booklets and papers for you to read-"it was if the man had been here so many times, it seemed like he was reciting a memorized script. It was was obvious that he didn't want to be there. Looking up the man finally noticed Darris. Placing his hand on his chin, he tried to recall if he had met him somewhere. Risa walked among the boys and handed them each a piece of paper, and a small booklet. The other girl hovered over to the other half of the group and handed them one as well. Looking up at Darris, Newton wasn't sure if she was to be handing him a booklet or not. Darris gazed down at her expectantly, so she slowly handed him one anyway. When Risa reached Fallen, she scoffed and pretty much threw the booklet at him. When the two of them got back to their original positions, Risa placed her hands on his hips and spoke. " I have so graciously Highlighted the some most important parts of the booklet, an example being THE DESTRUCTION OF SCHOOL PROPERTY....." Sighing, the coach rubbed the back of his head "With that being said, I also have to say that Gavin, Makray, and Donald you're suspended from your elected sports teams until further notice. Come talk to coach Steel and I tomorrow." Risa looked up at John. "You're the human huh? Are you trying to get yourself killed?" All eyes landed on John, but even so she didn't really care that she was putting him on the spot like this. As a matter of fact, she was happy that she was addressing this. Just where exactly did he think he was? "There are some people here that will actually kill you, and not think twice about it!" By the look on John's face, she could tell he was seriously annoyed with her already, more than likely because she was lecturing him. "You humans always turn out to be a burden...And the rest of you-" Risa glared at him "ah mam!" the small curly haired girl gasped " Alright, alright, that's enough Risa, let's let the headmaster take over when he gets here. I'm sure you're really busy with other stuff. But I appreciate you two coming to help take names and getting the information for me-" The sound of the bell echoing suddenly screeched outside of the hall, signaling the end of class. It was at this moment the coach noticed Darris. Holding his hand to say something, a boy stepped in from outside to notify them that the headmaster had arrived. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ As the blaring of the bell broke her from her daydream, Hana stood up to pack her stuff. Making her way out of the classroom, she stood on her tiptoes to try to see if she could catch a glimpse of kyrs in the crowd. After a minute of trying to decipher her from the crowd, she eventually shrugged her shoulders and decided she'd find her later. Squeezing through the many bodies of students was almost near impossible. "Ah, Excuse me, oh Sorry" Hana said to a few people "No problem!" a few people responded back. Finally reaching the door, she sighed and stretched. "Okay, I better go meet Memphis." Hana said to herself as she made her way down the steps. On her way there she wasn't paying much attention, but instead, put her energy into thinking of what Memphis could possibly want to talk to her about. ~Hmm, perhaps he wants talk about that book I let her borrow a week ago....Or Maybe....~ Hana's eyes widened at the possible realization. ~No way!....Memphis isn't into those sorts of things!...ha ha there is no way...~ "Hey Hana!" A voice called out to her. Hana turned to face Ryu, who was running up to her. Smiling, she held her hand up, and he met her with a high five. "Have you seen Shin?" He asked, sounding a bit down trodden. "No, last time I saw him was before my class, plus I'd figured he'd be with you already." "......Well,What are you doing right now, let's do something" Ryu asked, still sounding pretty melancholy. " Sorry! I'm meeting up with Memphis. Maybe after!....But um..is everything ok" As the two of them walked towards the courtyard, Ryu eventually told Hana about his earlier argument with Shin. Of course he left a few of the grander details out, but she pretty much got the point. "Honestly Hana....I'm just so tired.." He placed his hand over his face. If Hana didn't know better, it looked like he was about to cry. But when he removed his hand, his face was nothing but dry. "This last time....With Shin being in his coma and all. and him almost becoming brain dead..I....That was just to close...and it's just really...put some things in perspective for me" Hana didn't say anything as she listened to him pour this out. This was all so unexpected, she didn't know what to say. From how he sounded, it seemed he'd been feeling this way for sometime. With the two of them standing there, it seemed that the people that walked passed them weren't there at all. It felt like it was just them two, having their own private moment, where anything could be said. Ryu talked non-stop, it was as if he was going to boil over, he honestly just wanted to get this out to anyone really, but he was so glad it was Hana. "And I know.. at first we just wanted to d*ck around, start up a gang..you know. And-" Ryu sighed "then of course drugs got involved...and don't get me wrong..Human drugs are..hehe petty great-" Hana rolled her eyes and smiled a bit. " But things just got too deep..and before we knew it...we were involved with some of the lowest scum of humans you can possibly imagine..and things got intense...But we were invincible...so it wasn't like we cared.." Ryu tilted his head down, as if he was ashamed of something, and stared at the top of Hana's shoes. Hana could see that he was molding something over in his mind. Contemplating if he should say whatever it was. Sighing he continued "Or so we thought..Whenever Shin got hurt...I finally realized something.." Hana knew what he was going to say. Chuckling, Ryu placed a hand in his pocket "Perhaps..this all just wasn't worth it. We've both just been wasting our time...trying to feel alive...or feel something. Perhaps it was for attention...Really, we've just been going in the wrong direction. A direction that'll eventually gotten us killed...haha...honestly...it feels funny to me to say that considering we're in the human world....To die in the human world? What a joke right? heh....." Hana stepped closer and wrapped her arms around him. Embracing him tightly, she spoke softly "I know you care about Shin so much....So very very much, and it's okay- " Hana honestly had no idea what to say. What could she say? She couldn't relate to their situation, considering she didn't know what exactly was going on. But she could understand how he felt about Shin almost dying. And seeing how Shin was acting now, it seemed like he was unaware of just how deeply that disturbed Ryu. He was so disturbed, he was willing to cut everything off, and resort to just a normal school life (If you wanna call their school lives normal,) just for Shin's sake. A selfless demon existing was rare. ~Ryu must truly love Shin~ Hana thought to herself. Little did they know, fifteen minutes had passed, as there were only a handful of students walking past them. Hana was late meeting up with Memphis, but she figured it'd be okay once she explained. As the two of them walked further ahead, a familiar voice ended up calling out to them "Hey Hana, Ryu!" Both of them turned to see Shin walking up to them. Hana glanced at Ryu and looked back at Shin "Hey, What's up?" Hana asked "Nothing much, I need to talk with you." Shin said, looking at Ryu "But first, I heard John was in a fight, he's probably in the the detention facility." "Haha No way! John? In a fight? Well...I mean he has been acting somewhat different lately...But really? hahah" Ryu placed his hands on his stomach and began to laugh. Shin chuckled a little to himself "Let's hope he was knocked a good one, and got his memory back. I'm on my way there now to see him, lets go." " You two go on head, I have something i have to do first" Hana said, stepping back, waving at them. "Alright, see ya later" Shin and Ryu replied ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ ~fifteen minutes earlier~ James held the door open for Hucklebee, Kuno, and Caedis. The building they stepped into was unbearably bleak inside. The walls were made of a cheap cement, with white paint plastered over it. Getting behind James, Hucklebee quivered. " I absolutely hate this place, it's just so dreadful, But-" Hucklebee turned to look at Kuno and Caedis, who for some reason, he thought looked somewhat exhausted. " I guess you two will have the honor of watching me give out some good old discipline!'" Hucklebee stood up straight, as if proud, but anyone seeing his face could see he was a little nervous, and unsure. "The building you're standing in!-" James interrupted " Is one of our few disciplinary buildings. Consistent, problematic children are brought here, and placed in neutralized rooms. As of now, we have to talk to a few of them." It was unusually cold within the halls, it was like opening a fridge. As the group made their way down the halls, they turned the corner, and were met with two student council members, both boys, standing in the hall. The door to the room was cracked open, allowing a little light to flush out, and light the wall. As if on cue, the bell screeched through the halls, signaling the end of class. Looking up, noticing their approach, the boy stepped towards the door and spoke something inside. Immediately two more council stepped out of the room, followed by Coach Magnus. Bowing, Coach Magnus said"Headmaster, thank you for coming. Maybe you can get through to thee boys." James nodded his head, while Hucklebee waved at him frantically "Haha, I sure hope so." Hucklebee stepped into the room, taking in what was before him. James followed behind, after he told Caedis and Kuno to wait out in the hall for them. Hucklebee smiled, and waved at them. "Hello gentlemen! It seems you all are in quite the predicament now aren't ya! haha" James bit his bottom lip, resisting the urge to say something. He wanted nothing more than to yell at the boys himself. "Well-" Hucklebee continued " As you all have read in your booklets, and are pretty much aware of, Fighting is definitely against school rules" Glancing at each of their faces, he could tell that much of what he was saying was going in one ear, and out the other. Hucklebee's eyes landed on John. ~Ah the human boy....Not sure why he'd want to draw anymore attention to himself~ "Let's get to it shall we?" Hucklebee held up two fingers and began to mumble something under his breath. It wasn't to long after that, that heat begin to fill the room, totally absorbing whatever coldness that filled the air. His two fingers begin to glow a rustic red color, his mumbling then becoming more distinct chants of some sort. It was like he was speaking a totally different language, and with how fast he was speaking, it sounded like some type of gibberish. James stared at Hucklebee wide-eyed "Siir..your going to-" Hucklebee held up his fingers and the red glow shot from them, and into the air, cascading the room in a red hue. The light then branched off into multiple streaks, each shooting towards each of the boys. Some of them tried to dodge what seemed like an attack, but it was useless, and the red light struck each of them. There was no pain, but it did make their bodies feel warm, as if they had just gotten out of a warm bath, with a tingling sensations that ran up their spine. Putting his hand down, Hucklebee smiled "No need to worry boys, all I've done was temporarily place a little bit of my energy within in you, along with a spell. It's the restricting kind. Which means, you all are restricted from using any of your powers until I deem it's ok for you to do so again. SO! No more powers in the meantime!" Hucklebee said smiling. "What!?" One boy yelled out. "You can't do that!" Hucklebee frowned " I'm sorry, but there is one more thing" Hucklebee ignored them "..You are all required to attend prom!" ".........." James stared at him. "What?!" Most of the guys, including James, yelled out at the same time. "I have all you're names down, and I WILL KNOW if you come or not. Especially since there's a little bit of me inside of all of you" A few of the guys shuddered in disgust at his last comment. "If you don't show up, I'll have your powers restricted for a longer period." Hucklebee finished, smiling. "S-Sir!" James hissed, as he hurried next to him and began to whisper in his ear. Yawning, Hucklebee patted his back and hushed him "James, James It's fine...everything's settled now, I'm sure the boys have learned their lesson, and I hope I don't see anyone of you here again." Hucklebee called out behind him. James followed in pursuit behind, voicing is disapproval of his decisions "Sir.. making them attend prom? Don't you think..that's the opposite of what should happen?" Hucklebee waved him off "No, no, heh I'm sure that is punishment enough. Now" Walking back towards Kuno and Caedis, Hucklebee clasped his hands together "Next stop, we'll head to the housing building, and establish a schedule, and place you in your new rooms." As James begin to follow, Hucklebee turned to him smiling " James, I actually have a task for you. You noticed the older gentlemen in room, have him come to my office. I'd love to have a chat with with him after I get these two settled" Without saying anything, James nodded. Coach Magnus walked back into the room shaking his head ." Alright boys, now that we uh..pretty much established your punishment, you're free to go...But just remember, next time you're thinking about brawling, remember you're gonna have to do it without any of your abilities. With that being said, I guess you're all free to go. Now get outta here." With all their mumbling and grumbling, the boys got up, some trying to test to see if it was really true that their powers were gone. With the failure that followed, it was made obvious that it was. As they filed out of the classroom, Shin and Ryu walked up just in time. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~7 minutes later~"Ah, I guess we missed the headmaster."Shin said as he watched as each of guys come out of the room."I wonder what their punishment was.."Scratching his head, Ryu leaned against the wall and crossed his arms. Soon, two familiar faces left, exited the room: John and Darris. "Hey man! You good?"Shin asked walking up to him"Yeah, so who won? Your face doesn't look too bad,not any worse then it usually does haha"The boys broke into a fit of laughter for a few seconds."Darris, what the hell are you doing in there anyway? HAHA did you fight too?"Ryu asked, playfull punching his shoulder. Stepping to them, James cleared his throat "Forgive my intrusion, but headmaster Hucklebee is actually really interested in speaking with you." James nodded towards Darris. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ " Hey Memphis! I'm sorry I'm late" Hana had finally reached Memphis, who was standing there, not looking annoyed at all. " I'm so sorry, I met up Ryu, and I had to talk to him for awhile. And haha, It's just a long story...haha. But hey I hear, on the other side of the school, they're holding some sort of event.. Hmm not really sure what it is, but let's check it out" 

 Darris Darris looked at Fallen. Considering the circumstances, Darris figured that he must have looked like some sort of protector over John. Looking up in thought of how to answer the question, he sort of asked himself. Darris supposed that on a plain level, he was interested in John's impossible teleportation. But more than that John was one of the few friends, if he could call him that. that he had made after entering this world. It was a much better relief than the last tyrant world he was in, and it sort of made him protective of friends. He was jerked out of his thoughts when one of the other boys slammed his head into the desk. I wonder if he is okay. A moment after the boy hit his head, the door opened, and a couple girls and what Darris assumed was an instructor entered the room. The two girl from the get go appeared to be opposites. The girl with the clipboard seemed shy and the other had a dominant aura, and she was angry. Sure enough, the other girl began to yell at the students about fighting and school property. And the whole while, the instructor seemed content, or rather didn't care enough to intervene. Soon after the shy girl walked out and handed everyone a booklet. Even to Darris. He sort of had to chuckle inside due to her indecisiveness about it. Talking a look at the booklet, sure enough, the destruction of school property part was highlights, and circled, and underlined, and bolded, and anything else to give it attention. Soon the headmaster himself arrived. Darris could swear if it was not for this arrival, that the one girl, Risa, would keep lecturing the boys. By this point Darris felt out of place. The headmaster held a powerful aura about him. Darris could not quite figure out why, but got a taste of his prowess when he increased the temperature of the room by a bit and restricted the inner abilities of all the kids in the room. Darris's own experience with such spells had proved to him to be a difficult skill to learn or use, but here this Hucklebee character did it flawlessly. But by the end of the visits, the boys were allowed to leave and in doing so allowed Darris to leave. This sort of left Darris a little confused. Why was he put there to begin with? Upon leaving the room, two more familiar faces showed up. Shin and Ryu greeted the two of them. Shin asked why Darris was apart of the group of detained students, but before he could answer him, the man who accompanied Hucklebee requested that he go with him to see the headmaster. It seemed to be some sort of trend or something where Darris could not answer questions due to interruptions. At least recently. But Darris was able to speak now. "I don't know." he said cooly, "The last time something like that happened, I was put in a completely white room." Darris looked at James impression to his reply before laughing a small bit. "Oh all right." He turned back to Shin, John, and Ryu. "Keep John out of trouble. And nice to see you guys again." Darris turned and followed James out of the building to who knows where the headmasters office was. Memphis Memphis was standing around when from behind he heard Hana coming. Turning to meet her she appeared a little exhausted, like she had to hurry her way over. He gave a little smile before walked up to her as she continued to explain why she was late. Placing his hands on her shoulders, he stopped her from talking. Looking into her eyes he began to speak. "I finished what Kelos needed me for and as far as the council can tell, I am not needed until sometime during prom itself." he sort of stopped himself to think for a moment. "I know this is not as elaborate as others, and that in general I am not good at this, but Hana, would you like to go to prom with me?" The entire time he was asking her, he sort of had a feeling of butterflies. He could not quite understand it, he was able to kiss her spontaneous that one night, so why is it an issue now? Memphis pushed it out of his head, waiting for Hana's reply. Elizabeth After messing with that one boy's nose, Elise walked away, the boy continuing to call at her, and calling her different names. Elise thought to herself how great it would be if that one teacher just left the boy there frozen like that over night. Walking forward, the crowd began to disperse. Apparently there was a fight here and different people were working to fi he tree, the circuit box and the sprinkler system. What kind of fight took place to do so much damage was beyond Elise, but she was certain it was not Jake. Any fight he participates in always ends up with broken walls and crushed veggie sticks. Spinning around and sitting on one of the benches, she pulled out a bag of veggie sticks from her back and began to munch on them. With the crowd mostly gone now, the one frozen boy was released. The teacher that froze him found him and unfroze him. He apologized and told him to run off. Walking back to one of the class buildings, the others fixing the school property had finished and also left. THe courtyard was now, for the most part empty, and this Elise liked. But she did not enjoy the quiet for long when that one boy came up to her and knocked her veggie sticks out of her hand. "I told you I would get you back." he said smugly. Elise stood up and pushed the boy back in anger. He just smiled at her before dodging her next attempt to push him. She attemted again, but he moved around her and tripped her. "Ha. Don't mess with someone who is a brown belt in karate." then he ran off purposefully stepping on the fallen bag of veggie sticks and getting away in the dorm building. Else stood up and yelled at him from where she stood, even though the boy would not be able to hear her. Picking up her bag of veggie sticks, she turned it over letting the crushed crumbs fall out of it. She sat on the bench once again and tossed the back onto the grass, not caring about it anymore. With sharp forced actions, she pulled out another bag of veggie sticks, and began to munch on those.

 Fallen Watching as the impudent student council, or in Fallen's opinion the teachers pet, pass through each of the boys handing them a booklet chucked full in school policies and rules, Fallen sighed and shook his head a bit. Being stuck in this pure white room that appeared similar to a mental hospital he was beginning to get extremely uninterested and found no amusement in any of the situation. Finally Risa made her way to Fallen, he couldn't help but sneer at her tomato red face, the girl was obviously extremely pissed off and it only made things a tad entertaining. Glaring at Fallen, Risa kept up with the too good of student act and literally just threw the booklet and piece of paper at him. Swinging herself around, her medium-length hair nearly smacked him in the face. Scowling to himself, Fallen whispered under his breath, "Egotistical monster" He crumpled the booklet a tad at the edge with his fingers, holding himself back from throwing it to the ground. Their eyes meeting as Risa made it back to her regular position placing her hands on her hips as if to appear stronger, Fallen glared at her in disgust. " I have so graciously Highlighted the some most important parts of the booklet, an example being THE DESTRUCTION OF SCHOOL PROPERTY....." None of the boys in trouble seemed to give much of a care to any of what Risa or the teacher had to say to all of them. The destruction of school property was in no way the intention, and besides half of them were only trying to keep John out of trouble but apparently you were supposed to let another student possibly get their a** kicked. They were not highlighting any of the fact of defending others, only what mattered to them. The schools money was clearly more important to them than their own students safety. "You're the human huh? Are you trying to get yourself killed?" All eyes now turned to face Risa, it seemed like she did care a bit... not only of her teachers feelings towards her... wait not that couldn't be right maybe she was trying to show that she "Cared" a bit about the other students so she did not appear to be so selfish. She was clearly not taking in consideration that this was a personal matter and that John possibly did not desire Risa to be blurting out his weakness right out in the open, yet again though Risa did not give two blinks at what she was doing. The look plastered on Johns face made it clear that he was not the happiest with the current conversation, but no more like a lecture. It was his own business of what he was doing, he could clearly take care f himself if he was able to make his way into Glass Academy. Risa was in no place to be in any judgement. There was more of an attitude than action to miss Student Council prep. "You humans always turn out to be a burden...And the rest of you-" Aleth then crumpled up his fists and glared down at the little princess of brat. Coughing, Aleth was able to get Risa's attention, they were glaring back and forth at one another. He didn't have to say anything, he made it clear with his glare that Risa was out of hand and had to shut her trap, but she was about to continue on. Luckily the little hot head was interrupted by both the other girl and the teacher. The headmaster apparently was now up to the detention room. The bell then went off clearly the awkward silence that was left, it echoed throughout the near empty pearly white room. "Hello gentlemen! It seems you all are in quite the predicament now aren't ya! haha" Looking up, Fallens eyes fell upon the head master and another younger man. It seemed as if annoying little puppets would disappear as long as you don't give them attention you desire. The headmaster in no matter what the situation is, always appeared in high spirits, waving at all the boys as if if was some family get together where nothing seemed to be wrong. "Let's get to it shall we?" The headmaster seemed to whispering under his breath, the room began to feel like a sauna. Extremely hot as if they were placed randomly in the middle of a desert the boys began to break a sweat throughout the room. Aleth glanced at the orc who was literally making a puddle with his salty sweat, the thing gave off strong scent of B.O. . Before any of the boys could kick out a whisper, the room was drowsed in a red hue from a strike from Headmasters fingers. The light struck each one of the boys, it didn't cause any pain, it only tingled a bit. "No need to worry boys, all I've done was temporarily place a little bit of my energy within in you, along with a spell. It's the restricting kind. Which means, you all are restricted from using any of your powers until I deem it's ok for you to do so again. SO! No more powers in the meantime!" Choking back his Saliva, Fallen restrained himself from an out burst towards Hucklebee, his powers were the one thing that kept him from going to each class to class. How did Hucklebee expect any of the boys to get any of their work done in studies, if the one thing they used for them was locked away for a decent amount of time. ~Looks like I am going to have to find another way to get all that work done.. this is so pointless~ Hucklebee frowned " I'm sorry, but there is one more thing" Hucklebee ignored them "..You are all required to attend prom!" The room was then struck with awe.. Wasn't it supposed to be the other way around? Fallen didn't really care whether he was attending or not. But he was defiantly not bring "her" after everything that had went down. So was he going to attend the dance alone? There was no way he was bring Kyrs or Namine either... but lately it seemed like Namine had another on her mind anyway.. but who? Eh why would he care. Why was he thinking of any of this... none of this topic was on his mind moments ago, probably a fair share of them men in the room were having similar thoughts or probably dreading having to step onto the dance floor. Watching as everyone began to make their way out of the room, Fallen leaned back over a desk and stared up at the tiled ceiling. It was all so pointless, a dance of all punishments? He was more bothered about not having his powers. "Damn it!" He yelled, kicking at a desk breathing in deeply. Rolling his eyes, Aleth walked passed Fallen and began to make his way out the door, "It is just a dance, I am sure you will find a date. Just learn to enjoy it." "That is not the issue..." Fallen scowled back, "Well a few days without your powers will be a little entertaining, just get used to it for now, you're not going to be able to fight back anyways." Clearing out Fallen and Aleth watched as James spoke up to the older man who was in the room with the human boy. Following behind him, the older man began to disapear along with James. Walking up to Shin, Ryu, and John, Fallen took a small breath and smirked. "Nice skills, kid" Fallen said giving John a thumbs up, "But what the hell was with all of that crap.. what were you doing with that crowd of no good mischief's.? They are no good for anyone here, why did you waste any time on them?"
