[Anime] Why Did You Start Watching Anime?
 I hope I ain't breaking any rules here... I was young and both me and my friend noticed the art style was different and far more appealing to us. We had no clue these "cartoons" came from Japan but Sailor Moon came out and we watched those too. Then Dragon Ball, My first anime I owned was the Tekken movie. We eventually found out it was called anime. So then we went deeper into the black hole.
