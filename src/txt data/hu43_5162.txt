[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 ^ wait.....episode 12 was the last ep of season 1......it ended sooner thatn I thought. I wish Attack on Titan would be at the same pace as Valvrave and not drag it on... anyway, episode 12 left me haging...now I want more....of this anime on steroids
