 1st Playthrough + No Walkthrough Do other players do this often?
 I want to play a game without a walkthrough, but then when games start adding cool secrets and one time only events that need certain actions to be triggered, or certain items that can only be obtained at a certain point, I end up having to look things up just so I don't miss them.
