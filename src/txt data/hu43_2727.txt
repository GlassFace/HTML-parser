 Updated accordingly. You'll notice a few names have been switched from villain to anti-hero and maybe vice versa. The nominations for anti-hero outweighed the nominations for villain for certain people. But more negative or positive noms can change that easily. Let's hope there's still a little drama left before the versus competition starts on Monday. There's still a few days left. Get it all out of your systems while you can. @Struggler - Racist? All day, errry day. And get rid of those damn crickets.

 I nominate Jellz for anti hero! and I nominate Kenji as the Villain! 
 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses. Beside you as you like softly down, I will be until I hear the words "Checkmate". ~Sebastian Michaelis ~ Individual 4 ~ A4's Greatest Villain <Right Here Lmao

Anyhow, the roster's been updated again. Only 2 days to get your final peace in, people. Then, on Monday I'll be putting up two anti-hero versus threads, and two villain versus threads.

 I change my villain nomination to Nessa. We all know of the nefarious things she does. Those poor dogs...

 Originally Posted by Struggler I change my villain nomination to Nessa. We all know of the nefarious things she does. Those poor dogs... ...Does that make Nessa's "breeder dogs" the anti-hero then? Victim? Perhaps both... ----- @Nessa - Enjoy going up against some of the worst baddies to walk the digital surface of A4. If you went against soyuza.. it'd be a tough call.. @wesleyv1 - You're Struggler's second nominator for villain; but he has 3+ for anti-hero. If you want, you can find some other random person for a villain. @Everyone - This closes up at midnight PST. So like, 3am for EST. Other time zones and your country of affiliation are your own problem, not mine. Two versus threads for each category will be going up tomorrow morning though. Get ready for some mud slinging and slanderous ridicule.
