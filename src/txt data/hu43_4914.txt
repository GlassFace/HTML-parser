 Hard drive/disk malfunction?
 First, if you can get anything left on disk backed up to a network share or USB do it now. Second, how did you run the chkdsk (out of curiosity)? Did you force it to run at startup time? I bet there's an option somewhere to do that and that's really the time to run it. Cause a disk can't be checked while it's in use by a program. There are two things to worry about with disks like that. There's the actual disk itself, then the filesystem. The filesystem is just the structure that holds all your info. chkdsk can normally check and try to repair those things, but from the sound of it, there might not be much left you can do. It's just very hard to recover items if the filesystem gets royally damaged. Edit: One thing I've done once or twice for people is take a linux live CD, boot it, mount the windows disk, and copy what I can if the filesystem is still intact that way. Might be a strategy to try here. Think I got the idea from an old user here once upon a time. Edit: Also thinking the tool you ran really could've deleted everything. It's a possibility.
