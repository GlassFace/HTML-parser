[Anime] Which shows were better than you expected?
 So far this season, Twintail has exceeded all of my expectations by doing such a fine job of taking the dumbest premise I've ever heard and making it hysterical. Evil aliens come to Earth to "steal" various attributes, such as bloomers, ribbons, and twintail hairstyles. Yes. It's f*cking retarded but somehow works. Our MC is the greatest lover of twintails on Earth though, so obviously he's gonna have to transform and fight the badguys! Except, obviously you can't have twintails as a dude, so gotta genderswap him in magical girl battle mode. And somehow it still all works and is amazingly funny. It's perplexing how enjoyable it is.
