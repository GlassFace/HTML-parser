[Mecha] Cross Ange: Tenshi to Ryuu no Rondo (Cross Ange: Rondo of Angels and Dragons)
 Cross Ange: Rondo of Angels and Dragons (クロスアンジュ 天使と竜の輪舞, Cross Ange: Tenshi to Ryuu no Rondo) is a Japanese mecha anime television series produced by Sunrise. It is scheduled to air from October 2014. The opening theme will be performed by Nana Mizuki, and the ending theme will be performed by Eri Kitamura. A manga adaptation of the series started publication in August 2014 in the Japanese ComicWalker website. Due to humanity obtaining the data technology that has evolved to a great amountcalled "Mana"the human race is able to subjugate all wars, starvation, pollution, and other problems on Earth by using its power, which is similar to magic. Earth has obtained the utopia of complete peace and no wants. First princess of the Misurugi Empire, Angelize. As with everyone else, she also had no wants or worries. She was celebrated by the people of the empire, and was supposed to wear the crown. However, she realizes the shocking truth that she is a Norma. "Norma": An irregular existence that cannot use Mana, and are treated as heretics and as "things" rather than people. Having everything stolen from her, she isolates herself on a remote island. What was waiting for her there was a fateful meeting with a group of Norma girls who know nothing but battle. The girls spend their days riding humanoid robot weapons called "Barameiru" hunting giant dragons that have come from another dimension to invade. Having her name taken from her, what will soldier Ange see at the end of the fight? What can she believe in? What will she obtain? The story of a single girl's fortitude starts now.

 I'm not sure if the first episode being the most aggressively boring Gundam SEED ripoff is worse than the horrifically, brutal rape scene that was played up for fanservice or not, but this is pretty easily the worst show of the season! I'm real confused by Sunrise here, it seems pretty difficult to **** up "giant robots fighting dragons" this badly. 

 yeah, I thought of Gundam Seed to in the beginning. This season is pretty much crap with the exeption of a few other shows.

 This got really edgy really fast. It was kind of good in the second half of the episode, but meh. I'll probably give it another couple of episodes before likely dropping it.

This is the same studio that did Valvrave the Liberator. If you don't expect them to make edgy asspulls and stupid bullshit by now, then there's a problem. 

 I dunno, Valvrave had a poorly conceived rape scene in place of actual character development and conflict, which was pretty distasteful, but it wasn't really played up for sexual tension or fanservice. Like yeah it was obviously terrible, but this show managed to be so much worse by using anal rape for nothing but fan service. It was intended to be titillating which I guess says how ****ed up the shows audience is. 

 Thanks for the comments. I'm gonna skip this one (:

 I do see what you mean. Either way, I have no expectations for this show, and I doubt I'll follow it beyond 4 episodes. 

 First episode gets a Sodomy/10
