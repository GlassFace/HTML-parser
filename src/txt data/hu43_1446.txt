[Drama] Nagi no Asu Kara
 Coming October 3rd... Long ago, humanity lived in the sea. But the humans who longed for the land left the sea behind. They cast aside the special raiment they'd been given by the sea god that let them live in the ocean. The thinking of the sea humans and the land humans became as separate as the places they lived, and as countless time passed, they forgot they were once one people. This will change as the land-dwelling human Tsumugu Kihara befriends four girls who live in a village at the bottom of the sea.

 I am literally 2 minutes into this show and he says hello to the boy and girl. My first thought "Hmm the purple hair girl sounds like Ai Kayano" Two seconds Later. Manaka appears. "THATS KANAHANA!!!!" Two of my favorite female voice actors in one show...I already know I am going to love it. Ill finish it and give my opinion. 

 I am in love with this show, everything about it just seems like my kind of anime. The first episode was very good and it appears I am going to really enjoy this series I can't wait for the relationships of the characters to begin to adapt further. When the first fish appeared I was like "..wat" Also farting fish legs.

 I now see why this is in the Drama category. There's going to be a lot of love problems and I am looking forward to it haha. 

 Really enjoyed the first episode, and I can tell that I'm really going to like this anime a lot, its a breath of fresh air from other anime's in terms of scenery. I love how there is people above and below surface, it adds a great twist to the show and the love story looks very promising but I'll be mad if she doesn't end up with Hikari by the end of this series lol.

 OH, it's only first episode and it almost made me tear up a bit. I can feel the drama already!!!!  Spoiler I feel bad for Hikari already, becuase of Manaka developing a close relationshp with the land boy. Kaname > Hikari > Manaka < Land boy

Kaname > Hikari > Manaka < Land boy  Spoiler But I'm rooting for the land boy. Hikari doesn't treat her as well. Hikari's relationship with Manaka is too possessive and one-sided, while the land-boy shows respect for who she is. Although at the moment I'm sure Hii-chan still cares a lot deeper for Manaka than the land-boy, due to their history (the land-boy still doesn't know her)... I think if she develops a relationship with the land-boy it will be better in the end. They could develop a more level, mutual relationship together.

 Fasten your seatbelts for an emotional rollercoaster guys. (which is what I'm hoping for this show to become, xD) It's been forever since I've seen a good new drama anime since AnoHana. Great first episode, and I'm really looking forward to how their relationships change because of all these different love complications.

 Oooh... you water breathers always ganging up on the status quo. But some of us progressives on the land won't back down for change and unity! You may not want to be lumped in with our lot, but let me tell you something... we're all human! That's right, you're human just like us land dwellers! Just because you have the raiment of the deities and live with messengers of the deities, that doesn't mean you're better than us! We're all human in the end, even if we made a mistake in the past!
