[General Discussion] Why is there so much anger?
 Why is there so much anger? This thread is sort of following on from Laus' thread: http://www.anime-forums.com/showthread.php?159018-Anyone-else-notice-how-messed-up-people-are-getting-now-a-days&p=3627203#post3627203 I never really thought about it until recently; over time I've gradually noticed more and more hate between people. Here in the United Kingdom, people justify insulting one another by claiming it's friendly 'banter' (at least this is the case in college). Even in general people just aren't nice to each other, especially amongst teens. Even children are swearing at their elders like it's nothing. It's actually quite surprising. What do you think? What do you think causes this? Is it necessary? What are your views? Do you think people are just nasty in general? 
見 ぬ が 花 Reality can't compete with imagination. 秋茄子は嫁に食わすな。 Don't let yourself be taken advantage of. Click here, join the sweet side! This isn't divine judgement, it's the work of a childish killer playing at divine retribution. That's all.
