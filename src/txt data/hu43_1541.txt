[General Discussion] If offered, Would you accept immortality? - Page 2
 In a bleeding heartbeat. There are too many things I want to do. But with one concession. I want to be immortal with from age 25.

 Well its a better choice than the vampire thing :/ so I'm all for it! 
 Only 900,000 years? What's the point? Real immortality or gtfo. I wouldn't even be able to see the death of our Sun in 900k years, let alone have any chance to see everything I'd want to see. Bored of life or not, being around to see everything the universe has to offer in the time that it exists would be worth it. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget
 I would... if I didn't have to look the same age all my life. Looking like a child forever would most certainly be disappointing.

Unless I'm reading it incorrectly, the choice is either take immortality, or die right this second. 
 I would probably take it, though i probably shouldn't. I would probably end up causing alot of trouble. 
 I would like the deal at age 21 since my body isn't crumbling (at least not too much). My brother travels a lot for his job, and tells me all about different countries and cultures. I would love to have the time to see the beauties of the world and I don't think I could do it in just one lifetime. 
 This sounds oddly like Goethe's Faust where a demon called Mephistopheles grants Faust immortality, but the moment he wishes to stop living, the demon gets his soul. I would have to say yes. I, too, am rather curious about how the world would advance during that time and how much knowledge I could accumulate. But, oh the devious things I could do during that time. I could just troll anyone who tries to kill me while acting completely calm. I could even go the extra mile and pretend I'm crazy and commit acts of suicide right in front of them just to prove a point all the while laughing like a maniac. After all, with the ability to just end it all whenever you want, I'd say its a fair trade.

 Pretty sure this was a Twilight Zone episode. Any no for me, Ain't nobody got time for dat.

 I'd like to die. I'd rather not have eternity to look back on all the stupid things I've done. 
Should've opted out just before the point of ejaculation b1tch. ~ Snap 
 I would do it. 
 Uh oh! Everyone can see my panties like this! And I'm not even wearing sexy panties! Dx 
 I would not accept it, I just never wanted to live forever, what would be the point of doing well in your life if you could live forever? 

 No. Many choose but don't think about the outcome of becoming immortal. Death of your family, friends, cousins. Wars, blood shed, many corpse laying upon the ground. The downfall of the earth then boom. End of the World. The horror of watching everyone perish instead of you.. is frightening. Lel just went too deep dere lel 
Answer my call, Dark Spear.
 I would accept the offer. I mean, who doesn't want to be able to watch anime for an eternity? But yeah, all joking aside, I would accept immortality. Not only do I get to stay youthful and strong, but I can regenerate, have adventures without worrying about dying (foiling the Mob, protecting the weak), and finally write that award-winning manga I've been itching to write. Something I hate more than anything is thinking that, years from now, people would not remember me. Light Yagami would be forgotten and forsaken, just like a lowly school janitor who had breathed his last breath working. No...even a school janitor would be remembered more than a boy who loved anime. If I had immortality, I would not be unknown. I would not be lowly. I would not be unnamed. I would not be anonymous in the sea of time. I would not die, ashamed of my lame existence and diminutive mark on the world. I would be famous. But hey, enough of my ranting. Great thread, dude. 

 No, I think that boredom would eventually become worse than death itself. That or, one would probably be hunted and imprisoned as some kind of freakshow once word got out about the "person who does not age or die". I can imagine scientists doing experiences looking for the "gene" for immortality (well that's actually going on right now too). 
 Well the chance at immortality is good and all but people would get crazy after the first 1000 years, well that's what I think. Even though I would give anything to see human advancement, I still wouldn't take the chance.

 Well I don't see the slightest down side in this deal. Where do I sign?

 I'd take it. The thing is, the passage of time is relative. We have a pretty short life-span, so when you think about living for 1000 years you think it'd drive you crazy. But if you were immortal, I think your perception of time would change too. There's so much you'd be able to do if you were given immortality. As other people have said, one of the main things I'd like to do would be to observe the progress of humanity. Though, I'd also like to be able to achieve my lifelong dream of watching every single anime in the world. 
 'I didn't want to learn that living meant losing.' 
 I probably would just because I have a fear of growing old. But then again.. I don't want to live that long... I would probably get bored.. 
 no, the only thing that makes life exciting is that it is short and you could die at any moment why would anyone give that away. not to mention watching your friends and family die. this gives you the ability to live forever not avoid depression and hate when your alone and tired of watching everyone die...make new friends and watch them die until your a shell of the person you were before because you would not care anymore after so much death and hate. immortality is a curse not a blessing 
 Definitely! I'd love to be around to see what the Earth's like in a thousand years time. 

 So let me get this straight, i can die after 900,000, if i want to??? Yes!!!!, this means i can be completely immortal, death is a waste of a mind, if i do not have to die i wont. I will spend my time absorbing knowledge or at least watching how far humans get. Maybe get a house on the moon (space-front property yo). Study mechanical engineering and be at the forefront of Gundam design/first Gundam pilot (no 14/yr old is piloting my baby) Honestly i can't see myself getting bored with life as long as humanity makes it too(or i can move in with aliens, i don't care, more interesting anyhow), i mean i can still watch anime. 
 the beauty of life lies in its fragility. i would refuse immortality because i feel it would cheapen my existence. lemme put it in a way you all might understand: a life with a normal span is Spirited Away, a near endless life is Naruto. 
weh mir, oh weh
 I would not accept immorality even if I was offered it. That's because I want to make the most of my limited life span. 
 How can anyone say no to this? The curiosity behind immortality is too much to say no to.
