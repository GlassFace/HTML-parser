 I only respond to phonecalls and play around if i'm in a good mood, otherwise I literally tell them to **** off or I nicely say no thanks. The "funniest" is probably some guy calling me and telling me my computer has a virus so he wants me to set up remote access so he can fix it for me... -.-' Also for the spam email from friends, I sometimes reply: Hey, you've got a ****ing worm, fix that ****.

 Spam is spam, they are deleted on the spot, and if I get a phone call from an unknown number I usual tell them they have the wrong number. And if it's spam or something from a friend I usual just hang up, I don't have time to deal with stupid s*it.

 I check my junk sometimes, it's usually consisted of pharmacy online-viagra, loterry, business proposals etc. funny thing that happened once when a girl added me and I accepted, we chatted and she wanted to cam. I declined. She said she cannot show to a mirror her...attributes. That really made me laugh lol. Then I deleted her.

Get an MBA..(married but available) -_- I don't check my Emails because there is so much irrelevant stuff that fill my inbox that I am completely uninterested with, I usually have to delete mass amounts after scanning the title. Marketing Gimmicks.. By the way why Ian The Korean's nickname is scratched was he banned?Can they ban a mod? Mind your business Daisky.

 I guess I'm the only one who doesn't get that "Viagra/penile enlargement" spam sh*t? Hm. I don't really have a "funniest," as I have no sense of humor. But weirdest? Plenty. I had two stalkers last year who would e-mail me from a new address each time I blocked or removed them. The e-mail contents? Well, A4 is a "family friendly" forum, so I doubt I'd be able to delve into the content. But let's just say, all of the above on the nasty-o-meter. Stuff I get now isn't spam; just stuff from friends. As I don't do the "Facebook" thing, it's one of the few ways to get a hold of me.

 Yeahp, I also got those viagra and penis enlargement ads. The first time I saw it, I laughed at it and deleted it right away. But after receiving similar SPAM messages many times, yeahp, annoying -_-

You should say it in very vague terms as our younger users will know exactly what you're talking about but they will pretend to be terribly confused. That way we can all go along with the lie. =)

 I got Russian male order bride in my junk folder. I was curious so I clicked on it and it came up with a picture of Struggler and Vess. I lol'd and pressed purchase. I mean why not... they were only $12.95 each, on special, I saved $5.

 I once recived a mail that said that if the decripion of birthdate fits me then I must marry a unicorn. A random memejoke, but the weird thing was the date was my birthdate (8 feb) and I still don´t know who sent it (o_O)
