 Mine is all a lie. Everything is as lie. I seek no truth and give no truth. Speak of light and you will be surrounded by darkness....

Is this like a quote or something? It kinda sounds like one of those things people put on Facebook when they're faking going through a rough time.

 My avatar is Kano Shuuya from Kagerou Project. He's got the ability to 'deceive one's eyes', so he can basically change how people see him, and in his character song ('Yobanashi Deceive' by IA) it says that he's spent so long lying that he can't differentiate anymore between what's true and what's not. In a weird way I kind of related to that, since I've spent my whole life hiding behind different personas to suite whoever I'm with and sometimes I lose sight of what's fake and what isn't, so I guess I chose him because he represents me pretty damn well? I'm trying to be more honest though. Hiding behind a fake personality can get pretty lonely. 
 Where to begin and where to lie and where to truth... You want answers one must ask me direct what they want me to answer and I am too lazy. 
 Avatar. Random picture i found when browsing the net one day. It makes me happy. Signature. Made by a friend from a different forum. She fell in love with the render and this is what she came up with. I was hella happy.

 There isn't much to my profile. My username is a combination of the first two letters of my first, middle, and last name. My profile picture is of Midna from Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess(she's adorable right?) which I am currently playing on the Wii. 
 Ironically my profile name is not from an anime or manage series...... I randomly created my user name, and later found this out: Henshin (変身, henshin) is the Japanese word for "transformation," literally meaning, "to change or transform the body." This word is primarily used in manga, anime, and tokusatsu dramas for when a character transforms into a superhero.

 I don't get how this Multi-quote feature works otherwise I would be replying to all of you, but all very cool stories. One specific thing is what is that profile picture ProtomanX?

 MsBloodyFallen <--- my modified IGN [in-game-name] from BloodyFallen. My profile picture kind of represents me, I'm a girl who is lovesick and spends her day forever waiting for unrequited love to turn into something so much better. So I confess on pieces of paper? yeah maybe ;D And with my signature, I use it as my 'tag' on AsianFanFics; it kinda shows how I feel near my crush TT^TT tehee (: [All images found on WeHeartIt & Tumbler]

I prefer elves though 
 Well, there's no "story" behind anything. I usually use sigs and avatars from things I'm really into at the time (new game/anime/manga), if I see something funny/cool-looking I'd like to use (like my previous Dovabear avi and current sig), or just old mainstays from favorite video games, anime, manga, etc. that I feel like using on a whim. As of the time I'm making this post, I'm using an avatar featuring Suikoden II's Luca Blight, one of the most hardcore villains in any rpg ever. Just a cool image I found, and then cropped and wrapped with my trademarked 2 px black border. Sig is a panel I cropped out of a VG Cats comic because I thought it would make a great sig. Did the same with it as I did with the avi, crop + 2 px border, but slapped my username on there, cuz, ya know, it's a sig. In the past I've done more with sigs to add a bit more flash to them, but I prefer simplistic, borderline minimalist, designs, so I usually only crop images I find now--sometimes I'll make some very minor alterations, but it's rare. Plus, I'm lazy, so my design preferences aligns nicely with that fact. Will likely be changing my sig as soon as something catches my interest or eye. 
 Go now. Our journey is done. And may we meet again, in the clearing, at the end of the path. ^____^ 8/6/12 Never Forget | #atleastididntcyberadude | 8/21/13 also Never Forget

 DynaBlade made this signature My Blog and YouTube channel :3  Spoiler http://www.hardpliers.blogspot.com/  Spoiler http://www.youtube.com/user/hardpliers Currently watching Sailor Moon
 I chose link for my old name was bare and rugged and I didnt like the way it flicked off my tongue, so I chose a name that has a meaning. When people call the game character "Link" they dont know that he is called so for the Link between the player and the character. Thus he is named link for this reason or in other words "Rinku". I try to link myself to my forum persona. I choose this picture for it shows the deepness into his eyes, you never truly get to see Link like this. So why not show it off? My sig is from the parody video by smosh of Legend of Zelda. Someone took a small clip of it and added some details for humor and baddaa bing baddaa boom we have a funny sig.

 For my picture I'm a brony and I love dark souls and I found my profile pic by accident and it was perfect for me. As for my signature that happens to me most of the time... 
Fool me once shame on you fool me twice f*ck you Patches 
 I change my avatar almost everytime, I need to stop changing and stick to one picture. It's Saber from the Fate series, as you see she has a command seal on her hand and wearing a sailor uniform, but wait! She never had a command spell in the series becuase she's not a master! HUH? Yeah, it's just some random picture I got. Probably going to change it later. :P As for my username, I really liked Fate Stay Night and Fate/Zero so I just used 'Fate' and Drexz is just a gay ass username :P

 My Avatar and name springs out from my liking of the anime Ghost In The Shell. "the Devil" was not part of the plan, but somebody already had the name "Kuze"; so I opted for this instead. 
 I just went for trying this name, and lo and behold it was available. I put Caesar Clown's face fault pic here because after choosing the name and seeing the pic I imagined Caesar reacting to "You just lost...The Game". My sig has a phrase in it that has a deep meaning, although it is subject to change should I find another one that piques my interest.

 My name is the name of my favorite mech on zoids. My avatar is a picture I took of my t.v. Someone made me my sig. The tabs under it are from the xbox forums. The quotes are from members of the forum. /end

 Mine is from a philosophical view, I suppose. My avatar, a snake, is symbolic of what I am in life. My sig, a swamp lake, is symbolic of where I'm at. For now, I'm just a snake. I slither on the ground, powerless. I work in retail and havn't started the college I want to attend yet. I'm just a 'snake' still slithering. I work in retail and hate it, just as a snake slithers in a swamp it wouldn't want to be in. In time though, I'll graduate college, get a better job, and instead of always being a snake, I'll evolve into a dragon and will have achievements and accomplishments. But for now, I'm just a 'snake'. And before anyone says it; Yes, this ideology in influenced by Naruto and Orochimaru, but I'm serious here and this isn't some crap I got out of an anime. I really do hope to beter myself later and to one day be proud of the person I am. 
 I am the serpent, lurking deep under water. Today, a water snake; tomorrow, a Hydra... 
 My profile pic is from the anime Oreimo, people who watched it should know who the character is :3, and my profile name, well it's a long story... 

 Avatar is from the newest episode of Tokyo Ravens simply because I thought she was adorable and my sig is just because it'd be nice to get to know people Username I've had for a long time, originally it was me missspelling a song by behemoth (ov fire and thevoid) but even now that I don't listen to them anymore I still like the username so I've used it in alot of places 
Trying my best to get to know people
