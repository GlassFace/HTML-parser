 A4 Gaming Streams
 Haii fellow A4 members! I see that many people are streaming LoL, and I am one of them too, but my stream mostly contains alot of swedish, so it might not be suited for you guys. But I'd be fun too see if people are watching my stream, I usually have music on since I do some solo games where I'm not talking! But I am also streaming other games, such as Batman Arkham City and soon I will be streaming Day Z. So.. you can find my stream Here if you have the time someday to watch. I do have an account on LoL NA, so if you want to take a game, just send me a PM here on A4! Peace!
