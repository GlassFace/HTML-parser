[Adventure] Maoyuu Maou Yuusha
 After a long and treacherous journey, our Hero finally arrives at the Dark Ladys castle only to find himself being asked for help. The Hero explains how the war that the demons have brought upon the humans have killed thousands and put more in misery. The queen of demons however argues that this war has made the human society band together as one and showed empirical evidence how it has increased population, increased production, boosted economy and improved society overall. Furthermore, she explains to the Hero that ending this war will result in a civil war that will produce more bloodshed than there ever was. The Hero, convinced that the only way to bring peace, relatively speaking, is to join forces with the Dark Lady, agrees to help with her plans! First episode was a bit corny but funny at the same time. Seem's like I'll like this anime.

 Shame they adapted the weakest of the manga spinoffs, but it should still be pretty decent. 

 Spice and Wolf anyone ? The dialogue and the characters strongly remind me of such, although it has a bit more shounen plot to it. I'm really liking it, literally nothing happened in the first episode lol, but somehow im already hooked xD

 I would have had a better time watching this if the Crunchyroll/HorribleSubs release wasn't in 30fps for some stupid reason. 
 How could anyone watch anything below 720P?!

 As long as it's not pixelated, I can accept any quality of video. Now sounds and subs screwing up is another thing.

 Trying to watch the first episode as i type this. Not looking good, will probably drop it. It's entire premise is based on economic fallacies -_-

 the storyline isnt very interesting or anything amazing at all. The only thing thats keeping me watching this is the cuteness of the main characters. xP

I mean in the manga it was really all about economic and culture talk. Did you think this was going to be a romance? lol Well I wish it was more about romance, too. But we just can't have nice things If you enjoyed Spice and Wolf you will probably end up enjoying this as well, but if you didn't then maybe you should stop watching this!

 I like it. The characters are interesting and I like how everyday economics lessons are mixed in with Demon Kings and magic. It reminds me a lot of Sophie's World.

Pokota likes it, and that reassures me that its worth watching. I also don't feel like an idiot for liking it a lot as well.

 I'm having mixed feelings about this anime. On one hand, I enjoyed Spice and Wolf. Yet, on the other hand, I feel like Spice and wolf was more well done than this anime so far. Plus, discussions of economics in Spice were more realistic to our time, considering it is during the times of our history. Yet, on the other hand I kind of like Hero, demon queen reminds me of a few other female characters I know of, and demonic/human relations interest me. Though again, this anime seems really slow. Not sure....
