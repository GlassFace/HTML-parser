[Thriller] Zankyō no Terror [Terror of Resonance]
 Sypnosis - On a summer day, massive terrorist bombing suddenly struck Tokyo. The culprits behind the act that woke up this complacent nation from its slumber, were just two boys. Now, the culprits known as Sphinx begin a grandiose game that encompasses all of Japan. During the noitaminA 10th Anniversary livestream event earlier today, a new original TV anime series, entitled 「Zankyou no Terror」 (Terror of Resonance), was announced. It is from director Shinichiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo) and produced by studio Mappa. Yoko Kanno (Cowboy Bebop, GitS:SAC) will be composing the music soundtrack. You can locate the first trailer after the cut. MOETRON ANN

 I don't know, this feels wrong for some reason.

 Sounds pretty original. Has a kind of a Death Note x GITS mashup feel to it. I'll be looking forward to this.

 It's like K, Cencoroll, Tokyo 8.0, I dunno I'm getting many visions from this.

 There are two tall towers burning in the back. It does feel wrong but I have a feeling in going to like this anime 
 I think it looks interesting!

 Looks interesting enough... 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 I...I don't know how to feel about that preview. It looks really exciting, and I'm already conjuring up explanations and notes for the displayed scenes. I feel that this anime is going to be much, much more of a unique piece than the others this season. 
 I just watched the first episode. It was amazing! It's moving, thrilling, and rather poetic... really great story telling so far. Watch it, I'm sure you'll love it! I think so far that I would say it feels like Psycho-Pass with themes like Eden of the East.

 Fly high, Lisa! Damn I loved every minute of this, pure genius first ep...the details in the animation are out of this world! Dialogue is awesome, good voice acting and the plot seems cool. Can't wait for more 
 !THANKS AOIDE FOR THE SIG!
 Woah. Action paction, decent reveals of important plot points, interesting characters, and a gripping pilot episode. Good **** right here, I'm sticking to this. 
 ned, i had the same psycho pass feeling. i wasn't completely drawn in on the first episode but i have extremely high hopes for this anime

How much will it cost to clear out the rubble? The trauma? The dust blasting down ten or so blocks? The panic? **** is up with these *****s 
 WOW! This is really interesting. This has all of the right qualities to be an awesome anime. I also feel like there will be cliff hangers at the end of each episode. This definitely going on my list.

 So much to dwell on right from the first episode. This is what anime is all about. I'm really pumped.
