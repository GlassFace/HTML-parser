[Anime] Anime that makes you think
 I love Higurashi but I don't think I'd ever classify it as anime that "made me think" (at least, not intellectually. it's a mind****, but sort of mindless.) Elfen Lied is the epitome of mindless. Go for Paranoia Agent, that's a personal favorite. Perfect Blue is good if you wanna watch a movie. Mirai Nikki was pretty good, sort of had a Battle Royale vibe.
