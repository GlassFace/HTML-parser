[Anime] need more anime in my collection
 As of now the only anime in my dvd collection are sailor moon s1 prt1, the marvel animes (ironman, X-Men, wolverine, and blade) blue drop, bamboo blade, loupes gaurus, appleseed, and lady death. I was wondering if you guys could recommend some anime based on my top five ( sailormoon, clannad, blue drop, shaman king, digimon) or based on the anime I've listed above. Thanx in advance i appreciate the help
