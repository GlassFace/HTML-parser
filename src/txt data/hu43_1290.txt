 Anime in America?
 Because anime often appeals to the teenager/ young adult part of society and we make up A LOT of the people in America. Anime is a thing that stimulates us Americans in a way that we enjoy, much like anybody else who watches anime. It's more worthy of obsession than American cartoons cause anime generally has a direct story line it follows.
