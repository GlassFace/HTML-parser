[Fantasy] Log Horizon - Page 13
 Coming October 5th, 2013... Synopsis: The story begins when 30,000 Japanese gamers are trapped in the fantasy online game world Elder Tale. What was once a sword-and-sorcery world is now the real world. The main lead Shiroe attempts to survive with his old friend Naotsugu and the beautiful assassin Akatsuki. No seriously, this is a new anime. It's not one of those other two franchises with the same synopsis.
