[Anime] Anime that disappointed you
 Were there shows you had heard great things about, had you excited about watching them but when the time came to watch them, you just weren't feeling it? If so what shows disappointed you? For me Fruits Basket, Innu Yasha and Kenshin fell short of my expectations for various reasons.
