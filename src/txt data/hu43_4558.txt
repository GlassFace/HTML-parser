[Anime] "Romance Anime"
 I have recently discovered the world of "romance" anime. Most of them are themed in high school, but I can't help it, I just can't get enough of them. I'm wondering if anyone has any more recommendations of these in particular and I was also wondering if there are any out there that are a little more mature? (Not themed in high school) A few of what I'm referring to: Blue Spring Ride❤❤❤ Kimi ni Todoke❤❤ My Little Monster❤❤ Kotoura-san❤ Wolf Girl & Black Prince❤❤❤ Clannad/Afterstory❤❤❤
