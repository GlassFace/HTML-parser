 Awa 2014
 So, after having not posted anything in several months (well, a couple, anyway) I figured I'd come back after so long and ask about Anime Weekend Atlanta. Who all went? What was it like? Did you enjoy it? I would have went but I had to work all weekend long. Tell me what I missed out on. 
 It was only a matter of time... Now I am one with the night and stars again... Thank you, Rhyme's Law, for your signature art work.
