 2014. A4 Annual Awards- WINNERSSS!!!!
 I forgot this was happening lol there were no fights or chairs being thrown or people rolling their eyes and giving people rabies lol so all in all this was a very low key event. Congrats to you winners! 
 If it's your wish, I will follow you everywhere, even if your throne crumbles, and your shiny crown turns to rust, even if the bodies pile up endlessly, above the bottomless pile corpses. Beside you as you like softly down, I will be until I hear the words "Checkmate". ~Sebastian Michaelis ~ Individual 4 ~ A4's Greatest Villain <Right Here Lmao
