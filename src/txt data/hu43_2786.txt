 Jack Kirby's birthday
 August 28th is comic book giant Jack Kirby's birthday. (The creator and co-creator of X-men, Fantastic Four, Thor, Avengers, the New Gods, Kamandi, Sargent. Fury, and etc.) I found an enjoyable birthday-bash of examples at the Comic Reporter's tribute. There are many documentaries and one of them can be found here if you ever have the time or interest.
