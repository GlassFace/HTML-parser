 Anyone else have a food addiction? - Page 2
 I'm addicted to peanut butter. In my opinion, it should be considered a class A drug. It's just perfect. I love the way it sticks to the roof of your mouth, and I love the way it feels when you eat it, and I love the smell and look of it, I love EVERYTHING about peanut butter.
