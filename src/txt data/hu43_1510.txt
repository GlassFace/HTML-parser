[Personal Life Discussions] New toy I picked up today! - Page 2
 But what if your attacker has two dildos? 

 This is my toy Oh and i meant bo staff 
  Spoiler  Spoiler 
 Yah okay. Your thing looks cool, but it would be a sucker to throw. I have one of each, but i prefer my chinese staff. Not always, but japanese staffs are usually tapered at the end so they are lighter. I use my 6ft iron staff when training or doing a demonstration by myself because i prefer something heavier. I want a 6ft non tapered staff that can retract to a cylinder the same size as that baton. That seems like a futuristic weapon, it would be super awesome.

 Yeah it's actually a double bladed folding knife. It's weight makes it useless as an actual baterang.

 Nice "toy" you got there. Better not be whacking the life out of people with that thing.

 Doesn't seem like a practical carry piece. 
 It is far from ideal, granted but still very much a practical carry piece.

 ^That pizza ain't gonna slice itself. @ Picard - If I really had to pistol whip someone, I could do a lot worse than that.

 Sorry for bumping a dead thread but Looky what I just baught 
  Spoiler  Spoiler 
 and you have so much your need to defend yourself form i guessing haha imo only weak little pussies need weapons and if you wanna defend yourself learn how to fight because all the guns and knives and more is nothing more then a cowards way to feel powerful and safe if its for collecting stand point tho then that is different I personally collect weapons and would love to learn to use them professionally but I do not need to carry any of them to feel safe or to defend myself lastly most people carry guns these days so good luck rocking a baton 
 Protection? Ha i laugh at you. No this is merely for collection purposes. Trust me i can take care of my self 
  Spoiler  Spoiler 
 If I had a nickel for every time some "tough guy" crumbled in a real confrontation, I'd have a handful of nickels. 
 Zenex, i do not need one to feel safe either, but someone will not approach me with intent to attack if i am carrying a spear or broadsword, regardless of when and where, unless the police are feeling particularly twitchy. And if someone had a gun i would still want a knife, something big would be too slow in that situation but a knife is fine, especially if you do not want to get shot!

 That's a wicked cool baton.

 Ah man that was such a good movie, not as good as flashpoint though. You see how much damage those things can do now (provided you are donnie yen :3)
