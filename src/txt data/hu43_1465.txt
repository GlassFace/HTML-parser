[Action] Samurai Flamenco
 Yay, more superheroes! <3 I don't read many western comics with superheroes, but for some reason I just love the Japanese ones... Original anime scheduled to run on noitaminA for 2 cours. The anime's taglines read, "To those 'adults' who don't want to become adults..." and "Hero will never give up, never hide, never be defeated, never accept evil."

 Samurai Flamenco Male model Masayoshi Hazama decides to become a superhero, despite having no superpowers or the technology to create a high-powered suit. He becomes the hero, Samurai Flamenco and begins to fight crime in the name of justice. Police officer Hidenori Goto finds out about Samurai Flamenco and his real identity by a twist of fate, which leads to him getting involved into lots of trouble. Nonetheless, these two young men will come face to face with hardships of being crime-fighters while discovering what it truly means to be a hero of justice.

 "Goto-san, I messed up!" OMG, this show is so funny! rofl.

 This shows a lot more low key than I expected from the opening, but quite amusing. Can't wait to see the ramp up. 

 Hahaha holy sh*t, ep 4 was easily the best so far! More and more nutjobs dressing up in costumes, fighting crime. Love it. 

 I think Flamenco Girl is in looooovveeee...

 I accually stopped at the first episode, it's just really dull, but I guess I will come back to it in a month when I'll have nothing to watch 
 This is a very seinen series, I will say that Raul. It's not going to appeal to the mass majority of anime viewers, and its humor is probably drier than most younger viewers are used to. To me it's hilarious, but I'm also a professional in my 30's. And with that... Flamenco Girl... is shining!

 Well her friends got roped into the craziness a lot earlier than I expected, such a silly show. 

 Yeah, I can't wait to see the misadventures of the "Flamenco Girls", lol!

 Episode 7 and the plot thickens. Edit: Oh, I'm sorry, the plot REALLY ****ING THICKENS. Edit: Let me reiterate that... PEOPLE'S HEADS ARE GETTING BLOODY CHOPPED.

 Yup, end of this episode I was like, "wtf?" I like it though! Now we really get to see what this team can do! They threw it on us too suddenly though... no lead-up or anything. o_O

 Yeah the shift from "sort of slice-of-life 'superhero' doing pretty mundane crime fighting" to "traditional toku super hero" was kind of abrupt. I almost want to believe the next ep will start with that director from before yelling "cut" and all that having just been special effects or something. Since his manager said something about the director being interested in him again earlier in the ep, but I dunno. Maybe it's just changing direction pretty drastically. 

 Yup, you've got a good point there, Ian! This could be staged. With that 10 million yen they didn't give out, lol. That would explain the use of a hologram with the Torture guy. xD
