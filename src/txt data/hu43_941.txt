[Mecha] Valvrave the Liberator AKA Code Gundam WEED: Legend of the Galactic Space Vampires
 Episode 4 Holy crap, Valvrave... you did it again! Remember when we used to call Madoka a "dark show"? You have magical girls, then you have Puella Magi Madoka Magica. You have mechas, then you have Kakumeiki Valvrave. :/ Damn, this show gets me every time! By the way, they say the last Madoka Magica movie is supposed to be expectedly dark... I can't wait till it airs here (I already have my tickets)! I eat this dark stuff up, which is why I'm just loving Valvrave right now!
