 Cute anime girls transformed/corrupted?
 I'm too lazy to read all of what people said but, if someone has take it as a second to theirs. Selector Infected Wixoss. - This series has some serious psychological warfare. You'll see if you decide to watch it. Now, the main character is male but, if you're ok with gore Kiseijuu fits what you want kind of perfectly. Give it a try. If you're not afraid of manga Mahou Shoujo Site is a fantastic little series that has some of these elements. Enjoy!
