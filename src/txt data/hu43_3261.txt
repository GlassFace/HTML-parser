[Personal Life Discussions] Your Friends who watch anime
 If u don't want to read my whole post the question is: Are ur anime watching friends any different then ur other friends? For example are they easier to talk to about ur issues... Unfortunately I only have one friend who watches anime, and I can honestly say I feel like he's my only true friend I mean someone who would help u out when ur about to get into a fight... Also the way we communicate with eachother is different. For example when i talk with him i talk about school, anime, video games family we also talk about our various issues and i feel like he wont go out and tell someone about them or tease me over them.. with my other friends our convos usually have to do with teasing eachother talking about sports and the next call of duty game. And i once told one of them which girl i had a crush on in high school thinking i could count on him to keep the secret he then laughs and says I gonna tell her which he did. Now this might be because I just don't have many good friends lol. Enough about me I want to know if other people have similar relationships with their anime watching friends. Also other people view me as a Sports nut and most of my friends are sports nuts as well minus the one anime watcher. Maybe im just surrounding my self with the wrong people
